Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty low. I feel this weight on my chest all the time, and it's hard to find motivation to do anything. I’ve also been having trouble sleeping.

Consultant: I understand that you're experiencing a heaviness and lack of motivation that's affecting not just your mood, but also your sleep. Can you share more about what's been going on lately? Anything in particular that’s been troubling you?

User: Well, I’ve been drifting apart from a close friend recently. That change in our relationship has made me feel more isolated, and it's really adding to my sadness.

Consultant: It sounds like that relationship shift has intensified your feelings of loneliness and sadness. Let’s explore that a bit more. How do you think this change in your friendship has impacted your overall mood recently?

User: I guess it makes me feel even more alone. I used to rely on her for support, and now I just feel... empty, like I don’t have anyone to turn to.

Consultant: That sense of emptiness and the feeling of not having someone to lean on can be incredibly tough. It’s understandable that this situation would lead to increased emotional pain. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think that I’m just not good enough for my friends. Like maybe I did something wrong, and that’s why she’s distancing herself from me. 

Consultant: It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of self-blame and perhaps some negative self-assessment. This kind of thinking can deepen feelings of depression. Let’s examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I just feel that way because of how things turned out with her. It makes me question my worth.

Consultant: It’s really important to acknowledge that feeling like this can cloud your judgment and lead to conclusions that might not be true. If a friend were in your position, what might you say to her about her worth? 

User: I would probably tell her it’s not her fault and that relationships sometimes just change over time. But when it’s me, I can’t seem to believe that.

Consultant: Exactly. You offer compassion to others that you don’t give yourself. Let's try to challenge that negative thought together. If we consider the fact that relationships can evolve, how could you reframe your thoughts about your worth in this situation?

User: Maybe I could think that the friendship's change doesn't define me, and I’m still worthy of meaningful connections.

Consultant: That’s a real shift in perspective! Recognizing that your value isn’t tied to a single relationship is an important step. What could you do to nurture that belief and perhaps foster new connections?

User: I could try reaching out to other friends or engaging in activities I enjoy. I just don’t always feel like doing anything.

Consultant: It sounds challenging to find the energy, especially when you're feeling down. What’s something small you could do today that might help lift your mood, even just a little?

User: I guess I could go for a short walk or maybe read a book. Those things usually help me clear my head.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in a walk or immersing yourself in a book can help refresh your mind. Let’s talk about how you can incorporate those moments into your routine to build momentum for feeling better. 

User: I think I can set aside some time this week for that. I hope I can stick to it.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Setting aside time is key. How about we explore some potential barriers that could come up and ways to overcome them? 

User: I might just feel too tired or uninspired. It happens a lot.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you’re experiencing low mood. What if you started with very small goals, like a 5-minute walk? Would that feel more manageable?

User: That might work! I could tell myself it’s only a few minutes, and if I feel good, I can go longer.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Setting small, achievable goals can help you gradually build your energy without feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful thinking about it that way. It seems less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about building your confidence step by step. As we continue our sessions, we’ll work together to reinforce these strategies and address any resistance you might face. 

User: I appreciate that. I just hope I can get through this tough patch and feel more like myself again.

Consultant: We’ll navigate this together. Let’s also create a plan for our next session to check in on how these small changes affect your mood. What would you like to focus on next time?

User: I think I’d like to evaluate how those little steps impact my feelings and discuss how to strengthen other areas of my life.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, it's all about small steps, and it’s okay to take it one day at a time. 

User: Thank you. I’ll try to keep that in mind, and I’m looking forward to our next session too.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here to support you. Take care of yourself until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for the session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. Work has been tough, and I feel like I'm stuck and not good enough to handle the projects. It's frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure at work, and that must be really challenging for you. Can you tell me more about the specific situations that make you feel this way?

User: Well, I recently hit a technical roadblock in my project, and I couldn't figure out a solution. It made me doubt my skills and I feel like I'm letting everyone down.

Consultant: I can understand why that would make you feel anxious and frustrated. It’s not easy to feel stuck. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "Maybe I'm not cut out for this job. Everyone else seems to get things done, but I just can't." 

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really heavy to carry. What emotions do you experience when you think that way?

User: I feel sad and defeated. It's like I’ve lost my motivation to even try anymore, and it’s hard to get out of bed sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's important to recognize those feelings, but we also need to challenge those negative thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you aren't good enough?

User: I mean, I’ve completed projects successfully in the past, and my supervisor has given me positive feedback, but it’s just hard to remember that now.

Consultant: It’s good that you're able to recall those past successes. Let’s try to shift focus onto those moments. How did you feel when you accomplished those tasks?

User: I felt proud and confident. It was rewarding to see my hard work pay off.

Consultant: That pride is a powerful feeling to hold onto. What if we tried to remind yourself of those accomplishments when you feel the negative thoughts creeping in? 

User: That could work, but I'm worried it won't be enough to get me through the day.

Consultant: I hear your concern. It's a valid one. We can work together to build on that. Can we create a plan to start recording small victories or positive feedback from colleagues to help counter those doubts?

User: I could try that. Maybe jotting down my successes might help, but it sounds hard to remember to do it every day.

Consultant: It can be challenging to change habits, but perhaps we can set a specific time each day to reflect on your day and note down any positive moments? 

User: That might be easier. Maybe right before I go to bed, I can take a few minutes to think about my day.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! This small routine could help you focus on your achievements. How do you feel about that?

User: It feels a bit comforting to have a plan, but I’m still worried about dealing with my anxiety during work hours.

Consultant: Understandable. Managing anxiety in the moment can be tough. Do you have any coping strategies you currently use when you start feeling anxious at work?

User: Sometimes I try to take deep breaths, but it feels like it doesn’t help much because the anxiety is still there.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good start, but let’s explore more techniques. How about we practice some grounding exercises that you can use throughout your workday? 

User: I’m open to that. What did you have in mind?

Consultant: One simple technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method: identify five things you see, four things you can touch, three things you hear, two things you smell, and one thing you can taste. This can bring you back to the present. Would you be willing to try that?

User: That sounds interesting! I can see how that can help shift my focus from anxiety.

Consultant: Great! Let’s integrate that into your routine. When might be a good time for you to practice this at work?

User: Maybe during a break or when I start to feel overwhelmed with my tasks.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy. Each time you practice, remind yourself of your successes, too. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I think having a routine with coping strategies can help me build my confidence.

Consultant: I believe it will. So, as we wrap up today, let's summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ll start a daily reflection, noting your successes, and practice grounding techniques during work. 

User: Yes, I like that plan. It feels manageable.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, building confidence takes time, but you’re already taking proactive steps. How do you feel about your journey moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful, but I'm also a bit nostalgic thinking about how things used to feel easier before.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way as you reflect on your past connections. Let’s explore how to rebuild those connections in our next session. 

User: I’d like that. Thank you for today. 

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm proud of the steps you're taking, and I'm here to support you. Remember, it's okay to reach out anytime you need help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a mix of nostalgia and sadness. I recently ran into an old friend, and it brought back a lot of good memories, but it also highlighted how distant we’ve become. I feel a sense of loss regarding my social relationships.

Consultant: I can sense that you're feeling quite reflective about your past connections. It sounds like meeting your friend made you realize the gap in your current relationships. Can you share more about how this makes you feel in terms of your social life?

User: Honestly, it makes me feel even more lonely. I used to enjoy going out and catching up with friends, but now I often find myself avoiding social interactions. I wish I could change this but feel stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a part of you that longs for connection, yet there's also a hesitation or fear that holds you back. Exploring that feeling of being stuck is important. What do you think makes it difficult for you to reach out to others?

User: I think fear of rejection plays a big role. I worry that they’ve moved on and wouldn’t be interested in rekindling our friendship. It’s paralyzing.

Consultant: That’s an understandable feeling, and many people experience similar worries when thinking about reconnecting. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. When you think about reaching out, are there specific thoughts that come to mind?

User: I often think, “Why would they want to hear from me?” or “It’s been too long; they won’t care.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound like they might be contributing to your anxiety about socializing. Let’s identify how they make you feel. When you say those things to yourself, how does that impact your emotions and desire to connect?

User: It definitely makes me feel defeated and more isolated. I end up not reaching out at all, which reinforces my feelings of loneliness.

Consultant: That’s a tough cycle, isn’t it? It seems that the thoughts are keeping you in a loop of avoiding interaction, which only heightens your sense of loneliness. If we were to challenge those negative thoughts, what evidence could support a different perspective? 

User: Well, I have had good conversations with other friends before, and sometimes they seem happy to see me. Maybe it’s not as hopeless as I think?

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It’s important to remember that not everyone will react negatively, and there are positive experiences you can draw from. If you were to treat this like a friend reaching out, what would you advise them to do in a similar situation?

User: I’d probably tell them to just take a chance and reach out, even if it’s a simple message. 

Consultant: That’s great advice! It shows you have the capacity to think more positively about social interactions. How can we translate that advice into a small action step for you today?

User: Maybe I could send a message to that old friend and just say hi, without any expectations. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent step forward! Remember, this is about opening the door to possibilities, rather than placing pressure on the outcome. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It seems manageable, and I'm curious about their response.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mix of emotions! It’s natural to feel nervous, but excitement can be a great motivator. Let’s also think about how to manage any potential anxiety you might feel after sending the message. Do you have any coping strategies in mind?

User: I could try some deep breathing or maybe talk to myself positively before reaching out. That could help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Practicing deep breathing can help ground you, and positive self-talk can build your confidence. How about we set a timeline for when you’d like to send that message?

User: I think I could do it by tomorrow. Giving myself a short deadline feels motivating.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I believe that after you send that message, it could lead to some positive feelings about reaching out. How do you think you might feel afterward?

User: I think I would feel a sense of relief, and maybe even happier knowing that I made an effort.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step can create a sense of accomplishment. When we meet next, we can discuss how it went and explore any other feelings that arise from your outreach. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It feels like I'm finally moving in the right direction.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Remember, every small step counts, and there’s no rush. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session. It’s great to see you again. I remember last time we discussed your experience with group activities and how it brought you some joy. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. Participating in the group gave me a lift, but I still worry about keeping it up. Sometimes, I just don’t have the energy.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you felt uplifted by the group! And it’s normal to feel some concerns about maintaining that energy. Can you share what aspects of the group activities you found most enjoyable? 

User: I really liked the creativity involved, like the art projects. It felt nice to connect with others while doing something fun. But on days when I’m feeling low, I just doubt whether I’ll be able to go again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a truly fulfilling experience! Feeling connected through creative expression can be a powerful boost. When you think about the days you feel low, what thoughts come to mind that might be making it harder for you to commit to going back?

User: I often think that I won’t enjoy it as much or that I’ll just drag everyone down. It’s like I’m convinced they’d prefer me not to show up when I feel this way.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It’s tough when negative thoughts weigh on your mind, leading you to doubt yourself. Let's explore this together—do you feel that those thoughts reflect the reality of the group dynamic? 

User: I guess not entirely. The others seemed supportive when I shared my feelings last time. But my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario quickly.

Consultant: That’s a common experience; our minds sometimes lean toward negativity. What if we challenged those thoughts? Can you think of any times when you felt supported or accepted by the group? 

User: Well, there was a moment when a member really encouraged me to share my artwork. It felt good to be appreciated. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that your contributions are valued. How might you remind yourself of that support when negative thoughts arise? 

User: Maybe by writing down moments like that? I tend to forget them when I feel low, but I could keep a little journal.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping a journal can help you recognize those positive experiences and refer back to them in tougher times. Could we set a small goal for you around this, perhaps writing one entry per week?

User: That sounds manageable! I could do that. It might help me stay engaged with my feelings and experiences.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a step toward reinforcing the positive aspects of your participation. Also, how do you feel about trying some relaxation techniques that you could use when you’re feeling low, to help manage your energy?

User: I’m open to that! I need something to help me relax, especially on tough days.

Consultant: Great! We can try simple techniques like deep breathing or guided imagery. Have you ever practiced anything like that before?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I’ve never really tried it seriously.  

Consultant: That’s okay! It's quite simple. Let’s take a moment now. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, and then breathe it out slowly. 

User: *breathes deeply* Okay, that does feel calming. I think I could use this when I'm anxious about going to group, for sure.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that already feels calming! Practicing this a few minutes each day might help you feel more grounded. How about incorporating it into your routine, possibly before group sessions?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. It might help me start on a positive note.

Consultant: Excellent! You’re developing powerful strategies. Let's also think about what other activities you can incorporate throughout your week that might help you feel more energized and make group participation feel less daunting. Any ideas come to mind? 

User: Maybe spending some time outdoors or engaging in a hobby I love could help. 

Consultant: Engaging in outdoor activities and hobbies sounds delightful! We could aim to include one outdoor activity in your week, alongside your group participation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds amazing! Just thinking about it makes me feel excited.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! The combination of engaging in something you love with the group can enhance your motivation. Now, as we look ahead, what would you like to focus on during our next session?

User: I’d like to talk more about how to stay committed to these goals, especially when I face setbacks.

Consultant: That’s a valuable focus. Setbacks can happen, and it’s essential to have strategies in place. I’m looking forward to exploring that with you next time. Remember, you’re making significant progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and understanding. This has been really helpful for me.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m glad to be part of your journey. Keep reflecting on those positive experiences and practicing the relaxation techniques. I look forward to seeing you next time!

User: I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've noticed some improvements with my mood after practicing the relaxation techniques we discussed. I feel a bit more stable emotionally, but I still want to find more ways to incorporate those techniques into my daily life. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! I’m glad to hear the relaxation techniques have had some soothing effects. Can you share a bit about which techniques you found most helpful and how you've been using them in your daily routine?

User: I've been trying to practice meditation for a few minutes in the morning. It helps, but I sometimes struggle to stick with it. I also tried muscle relaxation exercises, and they definitely helped me feel less tension, especially after a long workday.

Consultant: It sounds like you've made a solid attempt to integrate these practices. It's normal to encounter challenges in maintaining consistency. What do you think makes it difficult for you to stick to these routines?

User: I think it’s mostly my busy work schedule. By the end of the day, I feel so exhausted that I just want to crash on the couch instead of taking the time to meditate or relax.

Consultant: I completely understand that—it can be hard to prioritize self-care when you're feeling drained. Would it be helpful to explore ways to make these practices fit better into your schedule? 

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to make relaxation a habit, but I also don’t want it to feel like another chore.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! We can definitely look for a balance. Maybe we can explore shorter meditation sessions or find moments throughout your day when you can do quick relaxation exercises. What do you think?

User: I like that idea! I could try just a few minutes during my lunch break or even before bed to help me wind down.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising approach! Incorporating those short breaks can serve as little moments of self-care. How do you feel about starting with just a few minutes of relaxation during these times?

User: I feel good about that! It sounds manageable, and I think I could stick with it.

Consultant: Excellent! Starting small often leads to more sustainable habits. Do you have a specific time or routine in mind for these practices?

User: I think doing it during my lunch break could work. I usually have about 30 minutes, so even setting aside 5-10 minutes for meditation could help.

Consultant: Perfect! That could also break up your work routine and give you a refreshing pause. As you practice, don’t forget to notice how these moments impact your overall mood. How do you think you might feel after incorporating this into your lunch break?

User: I hope I’ll feel less overwhelmed and more focused for the rest of the day. I could use that boost!

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! It’s wonderful to have that intention. How about we also talk about the muscle relaxation exercises? Have you thought about when you might find the best time to do those?

User: I think doing them before bed could really help. I often lie in bed with my mind racing, so calming down my muscles could help me relax.

Consultant: Absolutely, before bed is an ideal time for muscle relaxation. It can ease the transition into a restful night. Would you like to develop a specific routine for your evenings?

User: Yes, I’d love that! Maybe I could set aside 10 minutes just before bed to do the muscle relaxation.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting aside that dedicated time will help reinforce the habit. Just one step at a time. How does it feel to have these strategies in place? 

User: I feel hopeful about this! Having a clearer plan makes it seem more achievable, and I’m excited to try it.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It’s all about finding what works for you. As we go along, let’s keep assessing how these practices are making a difference. Remember, it’s perfectly fine to adjust them if needed. 

User: Yes, thank you. I appreciate that! I’ll definitely keep you updated on how it goes.

Consultant: Please do! I’m here to support you. It’s important to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. As we move forward, is there anything else you’d like to focus on during our sessions or any specific challenges you've noticed?

User: I think right now, it’s mainly about maintaining my relaxation practices and seeing how they evolve. However, I do sometimes worry about slipping back into old habits when stress hits.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s good you’re aware of it. We can certainly work on strategies to prevent relapse. How about we explore ways to strengthen your coping skills and ensure you feel prepared when stress arises?

User: Yes, that would definitely help. I want to feel more equipped to handle stressful situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that potential challenge is a great first step. We could talk about triggers that usually lead to stress for you and ways to counteract those feelings when they arise.

User: That sounds helpful. I often feel the pressure from work deadlines and rush into things without taking a moment for myself.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that insight. Deadline pressure is common, but it’s vital to integrate self-care during those times. How might you apply your relaxation techniques to manage that pressure more effectively?

User: Maybe I could take a quick break to do a few deep breaths or a short muscle relaxation right before I start working on a deadline.

Consultant: Yes, that’s an excellent idea! Those brief breaks can recharge you and improve your focus. It's all about building that awareness to pause and adjust when needed. Does this resonate with you?

User: It does! I think actively reminding myself to take those little breaks will make a big difference. 

Consultant: I love that positive mindset! This self-awareness is empowering. As we conclude today, how do you feel about your progress? Are you feeling more in control of your emotional well-being?

User: I really do feel more in control, actually! It’s nice to have a plan and practical steps to follow for managing my emotions.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You've made great strides. Remember, practice makes progress, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes will help me. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been wonderful witnessing your journey today. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. If you ever feel the need for support in between sessions, don’t hesitate to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to hearing about how you’ve been since our last session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite stable. My mood has improved significantly, and I’ve been able to find a better balance between work and rest. It feels nice to be in a better place.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear you’ve made progress. Can you share more about what changes you’ve made to achieve this balance? 

User: Well, I’ve started setting specific work hours and making sure I take breaks. I’ve also been spending time on hobbies I enjoy, which helps lift my spirits.

Consultant: Implementing structured work hours and dedicating time to hobbies can have a really positive impact on your mood. Can you tell me how these changes have affected your daily life and interactions with others?

User: I feel more engaged with my colleagues and friends. I’m not as irritable as I used to be, and I can actually enjoy conversations rather than just thinking about work.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic improvement! Feeling more connected to others can be incredibly beneficial. What do you think contributed the most to this change? 

User: Creating boundaries between work and personal time has made a huge difference. I’m now able to focus more during work hours and relax afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve found a routine that supports your well-being. Are there any specific goals or areas you hope to focus on next, now that you’ve established this balance?

User: I’d like to set some new personal goals. Maybe I can get back to exercising regularly or explore new hobbies that challenge me.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Physical activity and exploring new interests can enhance your overall quality of life. What kind of exercise do you enjoy, and what hobbies are you curious about?

User: I used to love going for runs, and I’ve been thinking about trying out painting or joining a book club. 

Consultant: Both running and creative pursuits sound exciting! Have you thought about how you might integrate these activities into your daily or weekly routine?

User: I was thinking of starting with a short run a couple of times a week and maybe a painting class on the weekends. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you ease back into these activities. How do you feel about committing to this schedule?

User: I feel good about it! It seems manageable, and I’m excited to try painting as I've always wanted to explore my artistic side.

Consultant: That enthusiasm is wonderful to hear! As you start this new routine, it’s important to keep tracking how you feel about these activities. Are there any concerns you have going forward?

User: My only worry is that I might lose motivation if I don’t see immediate results, especially with painting.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way. Remember, the process is just as valuable as the end result. What could you remind yourself of to stay motivated through this learning phase?

User: I could focus on the joy of creating rather than trying to be perfect at it. That might help keep me engaged.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Enjoying the journey can make a big difference. How will you remind yourself to keep this mindset as you start? 

User: I might set reminders on my phone or write it down somewhere visible. Keeping it in mind could really help.

Consultant: Those are great strategies. Keeping a positive reminder accessible can encourage you to embrace the experience. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and plans moving forward. What’s your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is how important it is to maintain balance and that I can set enjoyable goals for myself. Staying focused on the process rather than just the outcome will help.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve done a great job identifying the importance of balance and enjoyment in your pursuits. Before our next session, try to integrate those activities into your routine and observe how they impact your mood. 

User: I will! Thank you for all your guidance. I feel more empowered and excited to start this new chapter.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Your progress is commendable, and I believe you have the tools needed to continue moving forward. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. See you at our next session!

Consultant: Take care! I’ll see you soon!
