Consultant: Hello, Wang Qiang! I'm glad you're here today. I hope we can talk about what's been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. I've been avoiding everything related to school and just gaming all day. I don't even want to think about my classes anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really stressed and maybe even trapped in this cycle of gaming. Can you share a bit more about what led you to choose gaming over your studies?

User: I guess it started because I felt like I was failing at school. Playing games helps me escape that feeling, even if it’s just for a little while.

Consultant: I understand that games provide you with a sense of relief from the pressures of school. But it seems like it’s creating more problems for you in the long run, especially with your academic situation. How do you feel when you think about the number of courses you’re at risk of failing?

User: It makes me feel hopeless. I don’t see a way out of this, and it’s like the more I try to face it, the more paralyzed I feel.

Consultant: That paralysis can be really tough to deal with. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. When you think about tackling your studies, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think things like, “I’ll never catch up,” or “There’s no point in even trying.” I just feel like giving up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite discouraging. They’re definitely heavy to carry. Can we take a moment to challenge those beliefs together? What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, and is there any evidence that contradicts them?

User: I guess I haven’t really given myself a chance to see any evidence. I just assume I won't succeed because of how things have gone so far.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way based on your experiences, but perhaps we should consider other possibilities. If you were to try studying, what small changes could you make that might lead to a different outcome?

User: Maybe I could start with just one subject and try to get through some materials, but part of me feels like it wouldn’t help.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Starting small can feel intimidating, but it can also help build momentum. What if we set a reachable goal, like studying for just 15 minutes a day? 

User: That seems doable. But what if I don’t feel motivated to do even that?

Consultant: Motivation can be tricky when you're feeling overwhelmed. How about we connect the studying with something you enjoy? Perhaps you could listen to music while you study, or reward yourself with extra gaming time after you complete your 15 minutes?

User: That might work. I can see how connecting it to something enjoyable could help. 

Consultant: Great! That connection is important. Also, can we explore together what you think you might lose or gain by continuing to game excessively versus engaging with your studies?

User: I think if I keep gaming, I’ll lose my chance to graduate, which scares me. But if I engage with my studies more, I might feel stressed but also a bit proud if I start improving.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Balancing those feelings can be challenging, but taking steps towards your studies could lead to that pride you’re craving. How does it feel to recognize what you might gain by engaging with your academic work?

User: It feels a bit empowering, to be honest. But it still feels hard to imagine doing it consistently.

Consultant: That's totally understandable; change takes time. How about we talk about potential obstacles you might face while studying and strategize ways to tackle those challenges?

User: I think I might get distracted easily, or I could just end up going back to gaming instead.

Consultant: Distractions can certainly be tempting. What strategies have you used before when trying to focus? Could we brainstorm some ways to limit those distractions?

User: I used to study in a quiet room and limit phone usage. I stopped because I found it easier to just game.

Consultant: Returning to those strategies could be helpful. What if we create a specific plan for the times you want to study? For example, turning off notifications for an hour so you can fully focus?

User: That could work. It might help reduce distractions.

Consultant: Excellent! Creating a structured plan will make it easier to stick to your goals. As we begin to explore these changes, what feelings are coming up for you?

User: I feel a mix of hope and anxiety. Hope that it could work, but anxiety about whether I can stick with it.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely natural. It's okay to feel both hope and anxiety as you navigate this. How about we talk about how to handle that anxiety when it arises?

User: I think I need ways to calm myself down when I feel anxious about studying.

Consultant: That's a great insight. Breathing exercises or mindfulness could help you ground yourself. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing technique together?

User: Yeah, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a deep breath together, in through the nose... hold it... and out through the mouth. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice. I can see how that might help when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, these techniques can serve as tools to help you manage your anxiety. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that starting small with my studies while finding enjoyable connections can really make a difference for me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on small steps can lead to bigger changes over time. Let’s check in next session to see how this plan works for you. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way.

User: Thanks. I appreciate that. I’ll try to implement these strategies. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang Qiang! I believe in your ability to take these steps. Take care until our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang Qiang! It's great to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to adjust my schedule, but I still end up playing games when I get anxious while studying. I feel stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration. You want to change your habits, but when anxiety arises, you find comfort in gaming instead. Can you tell me more about the feelings that come up when you try to study?

User: When I sit down to study, I feel overwhelmed and bored. My mind just drifts to games. It's like I can't focus on anything else.

Consultant: I see. So, the feelings of overwhelm and boredom seem to trigger your desire to escape into gaming. When you think about studying, what thoughts come into your mind?

User: I often think that I’ll never catch up on my studies, and I feel like I’m wasting my time. It feels so pointless.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really discouraging. You mentioned feeling like you’re wasting time. How do those thoughts affect your emotional state when faced with your study materials?

User: They make me feel hopeless. I think, “What’s the use?” That’s when I reach for my phone to start gaming again.

Consultant: It seems like the thought of hopelessness creates a cycle of avoidance for you. Let's explore this step by step. What do you think gaming offers you that studying does not?

User: Gaming makes me feel accomplished and distracted. In games, I can quickly succeed, whereas studying just makes me feel more anxious and confused.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Gaming provides an immediate sense of achievement and escape. Can you think of any small activities that might offer you a similar sense of accomplishment but are more aligned with your goals?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. Maybe if there were quick and easy study tasks that felt more rewarding, I might not be so drawn to gaming.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Wang Qiang! How about we try breaking your study tasks into smaller, manageable pieces? Completing those could provide you with a sense of achievement. Would you be willing to explore this?

User: I think that could help. But I’m afraid that I’ll still choose games over studying.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have that fear. How about we also set a time limit for studying, followed by a short gaming break? This way, you can still enjoy gaming without losing focus on your studies.

User: That sounds doable. I like the idea of balancing both. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also consider how you can work on socializing, which might help you feel more connected and less reliant on gaming. What are your thoughts on that?

User: I want to engage with friends, but I worry I won’t enjoy it or can’t keep up. 

Consultant: It's understandable to have those concerns. What if we start small, perhaps reaching out to one friend for a casual conversation? How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I could try that. It feels less daunting.

Consultant: That's a positive step! It's all about gradual exposure. Remember, re-engaging with social activities can be a great alternative to gaming. How do you feel about making a plan to connect with a friend this week?

User: I’m nervous but also excited. I think I need to start somewhere.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Would you like to set a specific day and time to reach out to that friend? 

User: I think I’ll shoot a message this weekend. That gives me a bit of time to prepare.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Setting that goal can help ease some anxiety. As we wrap up today’s session, let's reflect on your progress and strategies. How do you feel about combining study breaks with short gaming sessions and reaching out to a friend?

User: I feel hopeful, but I still worry about messing it up. 

Consultant: It's natural to have doubts, but remember, change takes time. You've made great strides by identifying triggers and finding alternatives. Keep practicing these new strategies, and be gentle with yourself. 

User: Thanks, that helps a lot! I’m looking forward to trying these things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! We're building a solid foundation. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Let's meet again next week, and we’ll check in on how your plans have worked out. 

User: Sounds good! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang Qiang! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang Qiang! I'm glad you're here today. You've mentioned wanting to gradually participate in social activities. Could you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling lately regarding this?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really frustrated. I want to get back to normal life and socialize, but I often feel overwhelmed and hesitant. Just thinking about it makes me anxious.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Transitioning back to social life can be challenging, especially with your recent experiences. What specific social activities have you tried recently, and how did you feel participating in them?

User: I tried going to a few campus events, but even when I got there, I felt out of place and wanted to leave. It's confusing because I really want to connect with others, but I feel so awkward.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel awkward in new situations, especially when you're trying to break a pattern you've been stuck in for a while. What do you think makes you feel out of place during these activities?

User: I think I worry that people will judge me, especially since I've been away from campus life for so long. I feel like they might think I'm weird or not fit in.

Consultant: It's common to have those worries, but it sounds like you're being very hard on yourself. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about those feelings?

User: I would probably say they shouldn't worry so much and that everyone feels a bit awkward sometimes. But it's hard to take my own advice.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows that you can be compassionate towards others, even if it's difficult to extend that same kindness to yourself. Would you like to try some strategies to help you feel more comfortable in social settings?

User: Yes, definitely. I really want to feel less anxious about being around other people.

Consultant: One approach we can take is to gradually expose you to social situations. We could create small goals for you, like starting with brief interactions, so it's less overwhelming. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could handle short interactions better.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s brainstorm a few simple scenarios where you could practice those brief interactions. What are some places or situations you think you could start with?

User: Maybe just saying hi to classmates or joining a small group discussion. Nothing too big for now.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! Practicing small interactions can build your confidence over time. How do you feel about setting a goal to start with just one brief interaction this week?

User: I think I could try that. Just saying hi to someone in class seems doable.

Consultant: That's a great plan! When you achieve that goal, it’s important to acknowledge your success. How do you think you could celebrate or reward yourself when you do this?

User: I suppose I could treat myself to something fun or maybe play a game for a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! Celebrating small wins is a vital part of building confidence. As you progress, you might find that those feelings of self-doubt decrease. Would you like to discuss how you can challenge those negative thoughts when they come up?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Sometimes, I just freeze up when I think about what others might think of me.

Consultant: A helpful technique is to question the thoughts that come to mind. Ask yourself, “What evidence do I have that supports this thought?” or, “Could there be an alternative perspective?” What do you think about trying this when you feel anxious?

User: That could help. I guess I often assume the worst without really thinking it through.

Consultant: Exactly, challenging those assumptions can lead to a more balanced perspective. Over time, it can help reduce the intensity of those anxious feelings. How do you typically cope with anxiety in the moment?

User: I usually just avoid the situation, which probably isn’t the best idea.

Consultant: Avoidance can be tempting, but it often reinforces your fears. Instead, we can work on developing coping skills to face the situations head-on. Would you be open to discussing some practical techniques to manage anxiety in the moment?

User: Yes, I would really appreciate that.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to practice deep breathing. When you feel anxious, taking a few slow, deep breaths can help calm your body and mind. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise together now?

User: That sounds good. I think it might help.

Consultant: Let's give it a try. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable and take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four. Hold it for a moment... Now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a little bit calmer. I think I could do this when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly, especially before social interactions, can help lower your anxiety levels. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Each small step counts. 

User: That makes sense. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As you take these steps, remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge any progress you make. Would you like to set a time for our next session to continue working on these skills?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to keep working on this.

Consultant: Perfect! I'm looking forward to our next session. Remember, you’re already on the path to making positive changes in your life. Keep practicing, and we’ll build on that momentum together.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better already.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's great to see you starting to feel better. I'm here to support you every step of the way. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang Qiang! It's great to see you in this session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. Participating in some campus activities helped me connect with others, which felt nice. However, I still worry about not being able to keep this up and sometimes feel really self-conscious.

Consultant: It's encouraging to hear that you're feeling better and have been able to engage with your peers. It's normal to have worries about maintaining your progress. Can you share more about what specific thoughts come to mind when you feel self-conscious?

User: Sometimes I think that maybe I'm just pretending to be okay, and that I’ll end up failing again. Like, what if I go back to just playing games all the time?

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It sounds like there's a fear of losing the progress you've made. What emotions do you experience when those thoughts occur?

User: I feel anxious and a bit sad. It's like a cycle—I want to be social, but then I question if I'm really capable of sustaining that.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Wang Qiang. It's important to recognize that these negative thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety. Let's explore how these thoughts might be affecting your feelings and behaviors. This week, have you noticed specific moments when that cycle happens?

User: Yes, I felt it recently while preparing to talk to some classmates. I started thinking that they wouldn’t want to talk to me, which made me hesitate to join in.

Consultant: That’s an excellent observation. What thought went through your mind that made you hesitate?

User: I thought, "They probably think I’m weird for not being social before.” 

Consultant: That thought seems to stem from a belief about how others might perceive you. How do you think this belief affects your ability to connect with others?

User: It makes me anxious and I often end up not engaging, which only reinforces my feeling of being an outsider.

Consultant: Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that your classmates actually think you're weird for not being social before?

User: Well, I don't really have any proof. It’s just something I assume.

Consultant: It’s common to jump to conclusions based on assumptions. If you were to consider an alternative perspective—perhaps that your classmates are more understanding than you think—how would that change how you approach social situations?

User: I guess I’d feel less anxious and might actually give it a try. 

Consultant: Exactly! And if you allow yourself to try engaging with them, what positive experiences might you expect to gain from that?

User: I could end up making new friends and feeling more included. That would be great!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! As you think about these social interactions, let's explore how we can reinforce this positive mindset. What would be a small step you could take to engage more with your classmates this week?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or just strike up a conversation with someone I haven’t spoken to yet.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Joining a study group can help you feel supported academically and socially. How do you think this could help you manage your anxiety about social situations?

User: It would make me feel like I’m working towards something with people, rather than feeling isolated. I like that idea.

Consultant: Great! It's essential to further establish that connection. Let’s also consider your achievements from participating in activities. How can you remind yourself of those positive experiences when you're feeling anxious? 

User: Writing them down might help. I can look back at them when negative thoughts come up.

Consultant: Writing things down can indeed be a powerful tool for positivity! It allows you to reflect on your strengths and achievements. Would you be willing to keep a log of these positive experiences and review them before social interactions?

User: Yes, I can do that. It sounds like it could really help.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up today's session, I’d like you to reflect on our discussion. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: Realizing that my negative thoughts are just assumptions and that I can challenge them is a big step for me.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Wang Qiang! You've made great progress in recognizing how perceptions can influence your feelings and behaviors. Remember, it's completely normal to have ups and downs, but you're developing tools to help navigate them. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I feel more hopeful about the week ahead.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you're feeling hopeful. Stay connected with those positive experiences, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the meantime. 

User: I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang Qiang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your studies and upcoming graduation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit anxious about my studies, but I’m also trying to stay positive. I've managed to fix some of my academic issues, which makes me feel hopeful about graduating.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you are feeling hopeful and have made progress with your studies! It's understandable to feel some anxiety with graduation approaching. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your academic pressures?

User: Sometimes, I feel like I might fall back into my old habits of avoiding my responsibilities and playing games instead. It’s tough to keep the momentum going.

Consultant: It sounds like you fear slipping back into those old habits, which can create a sense of pressure. Let’s explore those thoughts together. When you think about the possibility of returning to gaming instead of studying, what specific thoughts do you have?

User: I often think, "What if I fail again?" or "I’m too stressed to study." Those thoughts make it hard to concentrate and keep me playing games instead.

Consultant: Those thoughts certainly can be overwhelming. Let's challenge those ideas a bit. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the idea of "What if I fail again?" What has changed since before when you were struggling?

User: I’ve been more focused lately. I actually attended more classes and completed assignments on time. But the fear still creeps in.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that you’ve made significant positive changes. The evidence of your recent successes indicates that you’re capable of managing your studies and maintaining focus. How do you think you could remind yourself of these achievements when those fearful thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I could create a list of my recent successes and keep it visible to remind myself of what I’ve accomplished.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Having a visual reminder can help reinforce those positive feelings. Let’s also talk about managing your stress levels. What activities help you relax or feel grounded when studying becomes overwhelming?

User: I enjoy listening to music or going for walks, but I haven’t been doing those much lately.

Consultant: Incorporating those activities back into your routine could be really beneficial for managing stress. We could explore creating a balanced schedule that includes study time as well as breaks for music and walks. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think having a plan would help me stay on track.

Consultant: Excellent! A structured plan can provide a roadmap, making it easier to manage both study time and relaxation. We can also include specific times for checking in on your progress. What do you think would be a reasonable frequency for those check-ins?

User: Maybe once a week? That way, I can adjust if something isn’t working.

Consultant: Once a week sounds perfect. Regular check-ins can help you recognize any changes in your behavior and feelings, allowing you to make adjustments as needed. Are there any other strategies you’d like to include to help you stay on track?

User: I’d like to practice some mindfulness or relaxation exercises to help ease my anxiety when I study.

Consultant: Mindfulness and relaxation techniques are excellent tools for managing anxiety. We can work together on a few simple breathing exercises or mindfulness practices that you can use whenever you feel overwhelmed. Would you like to try one together now?

User: Yes, I’d like to try some breathing exercises. That might help calm me down.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a simple deep breathing technique. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold that breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do this together a few times.

User: (After practicing the breathing) That felt nice. I feel a little more relaxed now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Deep breathing can really help in reducing tension and anxiety. Remember, you can use this technique whenever you feel stress creeping in. How do you feel about your ability to manage your stress now?

User: I feel more equipped to face my anxiety. Having techniques and a plan really makes a difference.

Consultant: Yes, you have an effective plan in place, along with some great techniques to manage your stress. As we begin to wrap up today, what do you think your biggest takeaway is from our session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can control my study habits and manage my anxiety with the right strategies. I just need to remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your progress and using coping strategies is essential. As you prepare for our next session, remember to take some time to reflect on your accomplishments and utilize the techniques we discussed today. 

User: I will. Thank you for your support and guidance. It's been very helpful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang Qiang! I believe in your ability to navigate through this period. Let’s keep working together, and remember that I’m here whenever you need assistance. Take care!

User: Thank you! I feel much better and ready to take on my challenges. See you next time!
