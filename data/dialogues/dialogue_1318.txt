Consultant: Hello Lin Feng! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I'd like to understand how you've been feeling recently. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low. After my mid-term exam results, I just feel so hopeless and have been questioning my future. I can’t find any interest in my studies or anything else for that matter.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the exam results have really affected your mood and sense of purpose. It’s tough feeling hopeless like this. Can you tell me more about the feelings you've been experiencing?

User: Well, I've been feeling overwhelmed and trapped. Sometimes, I even think about giving up entirely. I had a phase where I tried to end my life because I felt there was no point in going on.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you’ve been going through such deep pain. It's important to talk about these feelings. Can you share what triggers these thoughts for you, especially related to your studies and the pressure you feel?

User: Every time I think about studying, I just feel this heavy weight on my chest. My friends seem to be doing well, and that makes me feel even worse. I keep thinking that I'll never measure up to them.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough, feeling that weight and pressure from comparisons. It’s normal to feel anxious when you’re feeling stuck. I wonder, when you compare yourself to your friends, what specific thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think, "They are so much better than me." I feel so useless and like I’ll never achieve anything worthwhile. My family puts a lot of pressure on me to excel as well.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot of expectations weighing on you, both from yourself and your family. This thought of being "useless" can be really harsh. Let's explore that. What evidence do you have for this thought that you are useless?

User: I guess sometimes I feel productive when I finish something, but it's fleeting. Most of the time, I just feel lost and like I'm failing. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re facing challenges. Let's reframe this a bit. If you look back at some of your achievements, both big and small, how would you describe them? What makes those moments meaningful?

User: I did win a few awards in school while I was younger, but that feels so far away now. I wonder if it was just luck.

Consultant: It’s easy to downplay our successes when we’re feeling low, but winning those awards shows you have capabilities and strengths. For next time, could we try to remind yourself of those moments and challenge the thought that it was merely luck?

User: That makes sense, but I still feel like I’m stuck. It's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Lin Feng. Feeling stuck can often feel like being in a dark place. What if we explore some practical actions you can take, little steps that could help you regain a sense of control in your life?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. But I really don’t know where to start.

Consultant: Of course! Let’s begin with something small. How about we set a goal for daily activities that can bring you some joy or interest? What’s one small activity you used to enjoy or something new you might want to try?

User: I used to like drawing, but I haven't done it in ages. I guess I could try that.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful place to start! It can be a great outlet for your feelings. Would you consider setting aside just ten minutes a day to doodle or sketch? 

User: I think I could manage that. It’s not too much, right? 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a manageable step, and the goal is to reintroduce those small moments of enjoyment into your day. After a week, we can check in about how that felt. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I hope it helps me feel a bit better.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! It’s about taking steps to support your emotional well-being. Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do, and you’re not alone in this. 

User: Yeah, sometimes just talking about it helps. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Lin Feng. It’s important that we create a safe space for you to express yourself. Shall we also talk about your thoughts on the expectations from your family and how they affect you?

User: My parents really want me to do well, but their pressure sometimes makes it worse. I feel like I’m disappointing them.

Consultant: It’s understandable that their expectations can feel overwhelming. Have you had a chance to talk to them about how their pressure affects you?

User: No, I haven’t. I’m afraid they wouldn’t understand and would think I’m making excuses.

Consultant: That fear is valid. Sometimes opening up can feel daunting. What if you start with expressing how you feel rather than discussing expectations? It could help them understand your perspective better.

User: I guess I could try that. But what if they don’t react well?

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about their reaction. You might be surprised at how understanding they can be. Remember, if the conversation feels difficult, it’s okay to express that you need time to figure things out too. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll think about it.

Consultant: Perfect! You have made an important step just by being open to the idea. Lastly, let’s think ahead—when you feel overwhelmed next time, what's one coping strategy you can remind yourself to use?

User: Maybe I can try drawing or just taking a break to breathe.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking breaks and using creative outlets are great tools to manage overwhelming feelings. Remember, you’re capable of navigating through this. 

User: Yes, I will try to remember that. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Lin Feng. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what you've learned. How do you feel about the steps we discussed?

User: I feel a little hopeful that I can start improving things, even if just a bit.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway! It’s all about progress, no matter how small. Just remind yourself to be kind to yourself as you go through this journey. You can always return to discuss your feelings whenever you need to.

User: Thank you for your support. I really appreciate our talks.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember that you’re not alone in this process. I believe in your ability to make positive changes. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I’m glad to see you again. Can you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still struggling with my self-worth. After that recent school activity, I felt even worse about myself. I didn’t perform well, and doubts about my value keep creeping in.

Consultant: I hear you. It's tough when you feel like you’ve let yourself down. Let's explore those feelings a bit. What specific thoughts went through your mind when you were reflecting on your performance?

User: I just kept thinking, "I'm not good enough," and "Everyone else is doing better than me." It’s like I can't escape those thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, Lin Feng. These thoughts are quite common when facing challenges. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sad, like I’m not capable of anything. It's frustrating.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way under such pressure. Let’s try to identify how these thoughts might be distorting your perception. Do you believe there's any evidence that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, I guess I did well in my exams before... but then I think about how I failed this time.

Consultant: It’s important to remember that one performance doesn’t define your overall abilities. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say it was just one event and that they are still capable of doing well overall. 

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same perspective to yourself. Let’s work on challenging those negative thoughts. Can we reframe that thought of “I’m not good enough” into something more balanced?

User: Maybe I could think, “I had a rough day, but I’ve done well in the past, and I can improve”?

Consultant: That’s a great start! Focusing on your past achievements helps combat those feelings of inadequacy. How does that new thought make you feel compared to the old one?

User: I think it feels a bit better, like there's some hope to improve. 

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear! Let’s build on that. Can you recall an action you took in the past that helped you improve or succeed?

User: Yes, last year I practiced a lot before my exams, and it really helped. 

Consultant: Practicing is a powerful tool! Would you be willing to apply that same approach to your current challenges? What steps could you take to improve in areas where you feel less capable?

User: I could practice in advance for similar school activities. Maybe even ask teachers for guidance.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Lin Feng! Engaging in those proactive steps can really help bolster your confidence. Now, with your family, how do you feel about discussing your struggles and feelings with them?

User: I don't know… I think I might feel uncomfortable bringing it up. They might just say I need to try harder.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel hesitant. However, having a supportive conversation could be beneficial. What if we brainstormed some phrases that can help convey your feelings to them more effectively?

User: That sounds okay. Maybe something like, "I've been feeling really stressed and would appreciate your support"?

Consultant: That’s a perfect starting point! It's clear and straightforward. How can you plan to approach them at a time when everyone is relaxed?

User: I think I can wait until dinner when we’re all together, and then use that phrase.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting the right context can really help. After expressing your feelings, how would you like them to respond?

User: I hope they could listen and not just brush it off.

Consultant: It's valid to want that kind of attention. Let's hope for an open conversation. Remember, clear and calm communication is key to bridging that gap. How do you feel about committing to this approach in our next session?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but also hopeful that it might help.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel both, but having hope is a significant step! We can review how it went next time. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or prepare for before our next meeting?

User: Not right now. I think I just need to reflect on this and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Remember, it’s about taking one small step at a time. I look forward to hearing how your conversation goes. Take care, Lin Feng, and reach out if you need anything!

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it’s a bit tough. I still feel frustrated about my family situation, especially after the argument with my parents last week. It seems like every time we talk, it escalates into a conflict.

Consultant: I see. It's clear that the disagreements with your parents are weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what happens during these discussions? What do you usually feel?

User: Well, I usually feel misunderstood and ignored. When I try to express my thoughts or feelings, they dismiss me, which makes me feel even worse. 

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling dismissed when you’re trying to communicate. Have you had a chance to reflect on what specific things they say or do that make you feel this way?

User: They often say things like, "You don’t understand us" or "You're being too sensitive." It makes me feel like my feelings don’t matter at all.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you would feel hurt by those comments. When you hear those kinds of responses, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I start thinking that I’m not worth listening to and that maybe they’re right—that I am too sensitive. 

Consultant: That’s a strong emotional reaction. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you’re “not worth listening to”? 

User: I guess not much... It just feels that way in the moment. But deep down, I know everyone deserves to be heard.

Consultant: Exactly, Lin Feng! It’s important to acknowledge that all feelings are valid and deserve acknowledgment. What would you like your parents to understand about your feelings?

User: I want them to see that I have my reasons for feeling upset, and that I need them to listen to me without jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point. How do you think you can express this to them in a way that might be more effective?

User: Maybe I could try to calmly tell them how their words affect me instead of pointing fingers. But I’m worried they might still react negatively. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive. How about we practice expressing your feelings in a role play, so you can find the words that feel right and comfortable?

User: That sounds helpful! I can give it a try. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's imagine the conversation. You’ll start by expressing your feelings first. 

User: Okay... "Mom, I feel really upset when I try to share my feelings and I feel dismissed. It makes me think my feelings aren’t important." 

Consultant: That’s a really good start! You’re using “I” statements, which can help reduce defensiveness. How do you think your mom might respond?

User: She might say something like, "That’s not true, we care about you," but I think she’ll still need a bit more persuasion to understand. 

Consultant: And that’s okay. If she responds that way, what could you say next to help her see your side?

User: Maybe I can add, "I understand you care, but I really need your support when I share my feelings. It helps me feel valued." 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic addition! By expressing your need for support, you show her that you appreciate her care while also clarifying what you really need. How does that approach make you feel? 

User: A bit more empowered, actually! It feels good to have a way to express myself positively. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, practice makes progress. What might be a small step you can take to implement this in real life?

User: I think I could try talking to them this weekend when things are calm. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Lin Feng! Before we wrap up, what are you taking away from today’s session that you feel could help you moving forward?

User: I learned how to express my feelings better and realized that I deserve to be heard. It gives me a bit more confidence in approaching my parents. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. Your feelings are indeed important, and finding ways to express them can really make a difference. As we conclude, is there anything else on your mind today? 

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you for your help! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Lin Feng! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've felt a bit better since the performance, but sometimes I still struggle with my self-worth. I enjoyed the recognition, but it quickly fades.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear you've experienced some improvement! It sounds like the recognition you received brought you some positive feelings. Can you share more about how those feelings impact you?

User: I felt proud for a moment, but then I think it was just a fluke, and I worry it won't happen again. It’s like I can’t trust that I did well.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s a common response to feel doubtful about good experiences. Can you recall what specific thoughts came to mind when you doubted your success after the performance?

User: I thought maybe people were just being nice because they know my situation, or that I won't perform as well next time.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh on yourself. How do those thoughts make you feel when they come up?

User: They make me anxious and sad, and sometimes I just want to retreat rather than try again.

Consultant: It sounds like it's a struggle between wanting to keep experiencing positive feedback and the fear that it won’t be repeated. Can you think of any evidence that counters those negative thoughts? For instance, what was different this time during your performance?

User: I practiced a lot, and people did seem genuinely happy. I guess it wasn’t just luck.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! You put in the effort which contributed to your success. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you encourage them to view their achievement?

User: I’d probably tell them that their hard work paid off and that they should believe in themselves.

Consultant: Excellent! You seem to have a gentler perspective for others. What if we try applying that same kindness to yourself? How would it feel to remind yourself that your success is a result of your efforts?

User: That might help... I think I can try to compliment myself more often.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! Let’s consider setting a specific goal for you. How about recognizing a small achievement you accomplish each day, no matter how minor it seems? 

User: I could do that. Maybe just acknowledging I completed my homework or talked to a friend.

Consultant: Absolutely! These small achievements can build your confidence over time. Let’s make that your goal for this week. How do you feel about keeping a journal to note these accomplishments?

User: That sounds good. It might help to look back at what I’ve done positively.

Consultant: Definitely! Journaling can provide a great reminder of your strengths and progress. How do you feel now thinking about the week ahead?

User: A bit more hopeful. I think focusing on the positive side will help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It's important to harness that hope. If you notice negative thoughts creeping in, remember to challenge them just like we discussed. You deserve to appreciate your accomplishments!

User: I will keep that in mind. Thanks for reminding me!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! We’ve discussed some positive strategies today, anything else on your mind you’d like to explore before we wrap up?

User: Just a bit nervous about applying these ideas. What if I don’t notice any change?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Change often takes time, so be gentle with yourself throughout the process. You can reflect on your progress, even the smallest shifts matter.

User: Okay, that makes sense. I’ll try to be patient with myself.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! To summarize today, you’re going to keep a journal of your daily achievements and focus on being kinder to yourself. How would you feel about sharing your progress in our next session?

User: I’d be open to that! 

Consultant: Excellent! I'm looking forward to hearing all about it. Remember, it’s about celebrating your journey, no matter how small the steps are. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after our talk.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Lin Feng. You’re making wonderful strides. Until next time, keep fostering those positive thoughts! 

User: I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. The volunteer work I did recently helped me feel more positive about myself. I received some good feedback, which lifted my spirits.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the volunteer experience had a significant impact on your self-esteem. What specific aspects of that experience made you feel good about yourself?

User: I enjoyed helping others and seeing their appreciation. It made me feel like I could make a difference, even if it was just a small one. 

Consultant: Helping others can indeed be very fulfilling, and it seems like you found joy in those moments. Let's talk about how this experience might impact your self-view moving forward. Do you think you see yourself differently now than you did before?

User: Yes, I think I do! I feel more capable and realize that I can contribute positively, instead of just feeling low all the time.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in perspective! Building on that, how would you like to sustain these positive feelings and your sense of contribution in your daily life?

User: I think continuing to volunteer or get involved in activities where I can help others would be great. I want to keep that momentum going.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Engaging in activities that reinforce your sense of purpose can truly help maintain those positive feelings. What types of volunteer opportunities are you considering?

User: Maybe more activities with children or elders. I enjoy interacting with them, and I think I can learn a lot from these experiences.

Consultant: Interacting with different age groups can provide a rich variety of experiences and insights. How does the idea of getting involved with children or elders make you feel?

User: It makes me excited and a bit nervous too. I’m concerned about whether I’ll be good at it or if they will appreciate me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that mix of excitement and nervousness. Let’s explore that. When you think about your concerns of being appreciated, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often worry that I won't meet others' expectations or that I’ll let them down.

Consultant: Those worries are quite common, especially when you want to make a good impression. But let's challenge those thoughts a bit—what evidence do you have that you might let others down?

User: Well, I haven’t had any major failures in these activities yet, and people have responded positively to me so far.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems you have positive evidence to support your ability to engage successfully. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think about their contributions?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous, but just to focus on doing their best. That people are usually understanding and appreciate effort.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Applying that same kindness to yourself can be incredibly beneficial. How about we practice adopting that compassionate viewpoint when you're feeling anxious in the future?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It would probably help to remind myself of my positive experiences when I feel down.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can build a mental toolkit of positive affirmations and reminders of your strengths. How else can you ensure you reflect on your achievements and growth?

User: Maybe keeping a journal or reflecting on my day each evening could help me remember the good things.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent idea! It allows you to document your experiences, reflect on your feelings, and track your progress. Would you feel comfortable starting that this week?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that! I’m excited to see what I write.

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! Let’s also talk about your emotional state since we last met—how do you feel overall these days compared to earlier this year?

User: I feel much better. I still have off days, but it’s not as overwhelming as it used to be.

Consultant: That’s promising progress! Recognizing that you can have off days while still feeling generally better is important. What do you think has contributed most to this improvement?

User: I think the combination of volunteering and talking to you has really helped me change my mindset.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that our sessions are having a positive impact too! Reflecting on your journey, are there any strategies or tools you've learned that you’ve found particularly useful?

User: Yes, focusing on my strengths and trying to view challenges more positively helped a lot.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! As we prepare to conclude today’s session, let’s recap some key takeaways that can help you continue this progress. What do you think are your top strategies moving forward?

User: I think continuing to volunteer, keeping a journal, and being kinder to myself will be crucial.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! As we wrap up, let’s set a goal for your next session regarding your journal or volunteering. What would you like to aim for by then?

User: I want to write at least three entries in my journal and go to a volunteer event this weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful and achievable goal! I look forward to hearing about your experiences and reflections during our next session. Remember, you’ve made great progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and I’m looking forward to sharing more next time.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Lin Feng. I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it's all part of your journey. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot better. I’ve been more active in community activities, and people have been really supportive. But there are still some lingering thoughts I sometimes struggle with.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that you're feeling better and getting positive feedback from your community! It sounds like engaging with others is helping. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that are lingering? What are you struggling with?

User: Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed by my past. I have moments where I think about the dark times I went through, and it makes me a bit anxious. I worry about slipping back into those feelings.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those thoughts and feelings, especially considering everything you've been through. Let's explore this together. Can you identify what specifically triggers those anxious thoughts about your past?

User: It usually happens when I’m alone or when I fail at something. I tend to remember the times I felt really low.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Lin Feng. Those triggers sound challenging. When those memories come up, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I feel like I'm not good enough and that I could fall back into depression. It just feels really heavy and hard to shake off.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite distressing for you. Let’s look at them closely—do you think those thoughts reflect the truth about your abilities and progress? What evidence do you have that you are not good enough?

User: I guess when I think logically, I’ve improved a lot and gotten recognition from friends and neighbors. But in those moments of anxiety, I just seem to forget that.

Consultant: That’s a really important insight! It seems like your achievements and the recognition you’ve received show that you are capable. We can remind ourselves of those positives when those anxious thoughts arise. How do you usually cope when you feel that heaviness?

User: Sometimes I try to distract myself by watching movies or listening to music. But deep down, I know it’s just a temporary escape.

Consultant: Those distractions can be helpful in the short term, but they might not address the root of your feelings. What if we explored some strategies together that could help you process those emotions more constructively? 

User: That sounds good. I’d like to learn how to face those feelings instead of just escaping from them.

Consultant: Great, facing those feelings can be empowering! One approach is to practice mindfulness—finding a few minutes each day to sit quietly and observe your thoughts without judgment. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think it could help. I’ve heard about mindfulness but never tried it seriously.

Consultant: That’s understandable! Mindfulness is about being present and accepting your thoughts and feelings as they are, without getting caught up in them. We could start with just a few minutes a day and see how it feels. Would you like to set a specific time for this practice?

User: I could try doing it in the morning. It might help set a positive tone for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Starting your day with mindfulness can help ground you. Remember, it’s normal for difficult thoughts to arise, but acknowledging them without judgment can lessen their hold on you. What do you think might be a challenge for you with this practice?

User: I might forget to do it or feel too rushed in the morning. I tend to lose track of time.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way! One way to help is to build a reminder. You can set an alarm on your phone or place a sticky note on your mirror. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, that could work! I’ll try using an alarm. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s also think about how to deal with those overwhelming feelings when they arise. When you start to feel anxious about the past, what could you say to yourself in that moment to counteract those thoughts?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve made progress and that those feelings don't define me anymore.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the power to reshape your thoughts in those moments. Practicing positive affirmations, like “I am capable” or “I have people who support me” can reinforce that mindset. Are there any other affirmations you feel resonate with your journey?

User: I think “This too shall pass” resonates with me. It reminds me that tough times are temporary.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful affirmation! Using that in combination with others can create a powerful toolkit for you. As we continue moving forward, it's crucial to celebrate small victories along the way. Can you think of any recent victories, no matter how small, that indicate your growth?

User: Well, I recently got a compliment from a teacher about my effort in class. It felt good to be recognized.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful victory! Recognizing and celebrating those moments is key to building confidence and resilience. How would you like to acknowledge this positive feedback moving forward?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down these compliments and positive experiences to look back on when I need a boost.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! A journal can serve as a positive reminder of your growth and accomplishments. It sounds like you have the tools to keep moving in a positive direction. 

User: Yes, I feel optimistic about that! 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Lin Feng. As we wrap up today’s session,’s it important to take a moment to reflect on your progress. You’ve shown courage in facing your feelings and seeking constructive ways to manage them. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. These strategies and the progress you’ve made are here to support you. If you encounter challenges before our next session, don't hesitate to remind yourself of your strengths and reach out if you need additional support.

User: I will keep that in mind. Looking forward to our next session! 

Consultant: Me too, Lin Feng! I’m proud of your journey and growth. Take care until we meet again.
