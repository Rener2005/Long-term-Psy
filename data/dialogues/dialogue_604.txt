Consultant: Hello, D! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really self-conscious about myself, and it’s getting worse at this new school. I feel like I don’t belong here.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of self-consciousness and a sense of belonging. Can you tell me more about what's been happening at school that makes you feel this way?

User: Well, I often see my classmates laughing and hanging out, and I just feel out of place. Sometimes, I want to join them, but I freeze up. It’s like I don’t know what to say or how to act. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, D. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure to fit in, which can be overwhelming. What do you think is stopping you from joining them or expressing what you feel?

User: I think I’m just afraid they’ll judge me. And sometimes, I remember that my mom is in prison, and I feel embarrassed about it. I worry they’ll see me differently because of that.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially considering your family situation. Many people have fears about being judged. Can we talk about what thoughts go through your mind when you consider interacting with your classmates?

User: I often think that they wouldn't want to talk to me, or that I’d say something stupid. I end up telling myself to just stay quiet instead.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern, where you’re predicting negative outcomes before even trying to connect with them. How does that make you feel when you have those thoughts?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and sad. I just want to be accepted like everyone else.

Consultant: I can see how that would lead to a sense of loneliness and frustration. Let’s explore these thoughts a bit more. When you think, "They won’t want to talk to me," what evidence do you have that supports that thought?

User: I guess there’s no real evidence, but I just have this feeling, you know? Like I’m not cool enough or interesting enough for them.

Consultant: It sounds like you are really being hard on yourself. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to them to help them feel better?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own struggles and that they should just be themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, what if you tried to apply that same thinking to yourself? What if being yourself is enough to connect with others?

User: I guess that makes sense. I just don’t feel it myself right now.

Consultant: Recognizing that is an important step. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to practice being yourself in social situations, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Are you up for that?

User: Yeah, I think I could try that. I just want to feel confident when I’m around them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Let’s think about small steps you can take. For instance, starting a simple conversation with a classmate about homework. How does that sound?

User: That sounds a bit scary, but I could try. I just don’t know what to say.

Consultant: How about we come up with a few opener phrases together? You could ask them for help or share something you found interesting about the homework. How does that feel?

User: That sounds good. I could say something like, “Did you understand the homework from last class?” 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great way to initiate conversation without putting too much pressure on yourself. Remember, it’s just practice, so it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. How does that make you feel?

User: A bit relieved, actually. Maybe it won’t be so bad to try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Also, as you work on connecting with your classmates, it’s important to also be kind to yourself if things don't go smoothly. How do you feel about practicing some positive self-talk?

User: I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to struggle and that I’m doing my best.

Consultant: Exactly! Instead of focusing on self-criticism, you can acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that learning and growing takes time. 

User: I like that. I want to try to be more understanding of myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude, D! Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s perfectly normal to feel unsure when adapting to new situations. 

User: Thanks. I feel a bit more hopeful about everything. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Before we wrap up today, what are some goals you’d like to set for yourself this week in terms of social interactions?

User: I want to try to start at least one conversation with a classmate and be more gentle with myself when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! It will be a process, but I'm confident you can do it. How about we summarize what we've discussed and plan for our next session?

User: Sure! I’ll try talking to someone, and I’ll also work on my self-talk.

Consultant: Excellent! I’ll look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Remember, every small step is progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, D! Take care, and I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, how have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty lost. It's been tough making friends in my new school, and I often feel like I don't know how to fit in. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to connect with your peers. Can you tell me more about what's been happening in your attempts to make friends?

User: Well, I met some classmates, and we hung out a few times, but then I accidentally said something that bothered one of them. Now I feel like I messed things up and I don't know how to fix it.

Consultant: I understand how upsetting that must feel. It's common to worry about how our words might affect others. What specifically did you say that made you feel this way?

User: I just joked about something, but I think they took it the wrong way. Now, I'm scared to talk to them because I don’t want to make things worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about that. It seems like you care about how your words impact others. Have you talked to them since the incident, or do you feel too uneasy to reach out?

User: No, I haven't talked to them since. I keep thinking about what they might say or how they might react. I just want to be accepted.

Consultant: Wanting to be accepted is a completely normal feeling, especially at your age. Let's explore the belief you have about what their reaction might be. What do you think they might say if you tried to reach out?

User: I guess I'm afraid they might be really upset or think I'm a bad person for joking around like that.

Consultant: It sounds like your worries might be amplifying the situation. Do you have any evidence or past experiences that suggest they would react that negatively?

User: Not really... I mean, they laughed when we were together most of the time, so maybe it was just a misunderstanding.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like their first reaction was positive, which might indicate that your joke wasn’t inherently bad. How might you change your thinking about the situation moving forward?

User: Maybe I could reach out and explain that I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. I just don't know how to say it without sounding awkward.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be daunting to approach someone after a misunderstanding. How about we practice what you could say? What might be a simple way to express your feelings to them?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “Hey, I realized I might have crossed a line with my joke. I didn’t mean to upset you, and I hope we can move past it.”

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! It shows you're taking responsibility for your words, which can help clarify your intentions. How does saying that make you feel?

User: It feels a bit relieving to think about it. I guess I just have to be brave and try.

Consultant: Absolutely! It takes courage to be honest, and that’s a strong step forward. One thing to consider is their reactions. If they respond positively, how might that impact your confidence in future conversations?

User: I think I’d feel a lot more confident and less anxious about talking to them. Maybe things wouldn’t be so complicated.

Consultant: Yes! Building that confidence with small steps can really shift how you view these interactions. Are there any other situations in your new environment where you feel similarly anxious about connecting with others?

User: Sometimes I feel lost in English class. I struggle a lot and feel like I'm not good enough. That worries me since I want to make friends, too.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when learning something challenging like English. Sometimes, our worries about performance can affect our social interactions. Can you share what specific challenges you're facing in English?

User: I just find it really hard to understand the teacher sometimes, and I’m worried about failing tests. I think if I do poorly, it’ll make it harder to connect with others in the class.

Consultant: It seems like there's a lot wrapped up in your feelings about English. Let’s focus on that a bit more. Have you thought about any strategies or support that could help improve your understanding in the subject?

User: I’ve thought about asking for extra help, but I’m scared to admit that I’m struggling. 

Consultant: Seeking help is a strong and positive action, D! Everyone needs help at times, and it can be a great way to connect with teachers and classmates. What if you reframed your thinking about seeking help? How could that benefit you socially?

User: I guess if I ask for help, maybe others will see that as a sign that I care about doing better, and it might even help me make friends who are also struggling.

Consultant: Exactly! Asking for help not only supports your learning but also opens the door for connections with those who might relate to you. That can strengthen your friendship potential. How does that perspective feel to you? 

User: It feels encouraging! Maybe I could approach someone and say, “I’m having trouble with English, want to study together?” I just hope they don’t laugh at me.

Consultant: That approach sounds wonderful, and it's likely that many would relate to your struggle. Remember, most people appreciate honesty. How can we help you build that confidence to reach out?

User: I think just knowing that it’s okay to ask for help helps a lot. Practicing those phrases also makes me feel more ready. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Confidence can grow through practice and patience with yourself. We can continue to work on that. Today, we've talked about how to approach friendships and academic challenges. How do you feel about our progress?

User: I feel a bit better. I have some ideas to work with now. I just hope I can actually do it when it matters!

Consultant: You're making significant strides, D! Remember, it's perfectly okay to take small steps. Each one is an important part of your journey. Let's keep this momentum going, and I believe you'll surprise yourself with your progress. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. It’s nice to have someone to talk to about this.

Consultant: I'm here for you anytime, D. It’s important to continue our conversations and reinforce these strategies. You’re doing a good job, and I look forward to seeing you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially about school and your studies?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about my schoolwork, especially English. I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't catch up. It's so frustrating.

Consultant: I can imagine how overwhelming that must feel. It sounds like English is weighing on you a lot. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about it?

User: Well, I have tests coming up, and I struggle with the vocabulary and grammar. When I see the material, I just freeze up and don’t know where to start.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, D. It’s completely normal to feel stuck when faced with difficult material. What kind of thoughts run through your mind when you’re about to sit down to study English?

User: I often think, “I will just fail anyway” or “I’m not good at this.” Those thoughts just make me want to give up before I even start.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite discouraging. It seems like they might be affecting your motivation to even try. Can we explore how true you believe those thoughts are? What evidence do you have to support or challenge them?

User: I guess there's not really evidence since I haven’t even tried hard enough yet. But I keep thinking I won’t improve, and I hate to feel that way.

Consultant: That’s a really important observation, D. Sometimes, our thoughts can trick us into feeling a certain way that doesn’t necessarily reflect reality. If a friend felt like this about their studies, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that they can improve with effort and practice. Maybe I should take my own advice.

Consultant: Exactly! And remembering to be as kind to yourself as you would to a friend can be helpful. Now, let’s think about some small, achievable goals you could set for your English studies. What’s one specific area you’d like to tackle first? 

User: I think starting with vocabulary might help. If I could just learn a few new words every day, it might make things easier.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Learning a few words each day is achievable and will build your confidence. How about we set a specific goal for you? Maybe aim for five new words each day? 

User: Yes, five sounds good! I feel more confident thinking about that.

Consultant: Great! How do you plan to keep track of those words? Would using a notebook or an app help you stay organized?

User: I could use a notebook! That way I can write them down and review them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing things down can really reinforce your learning. How about we also think of a rewarding activity you could do after you reach your daily goal? 

User: Maybe I could play a video game for a bit once I finish my words for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun reward! It’s important to celebrate your small victories. Would you feel more motivated knowing that you have that reward waiting for you?

User: Definitely! It makes studying feel less like a chore.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let’s talk about your studies in other subjects. How are you feeling in those classes with this added stress from English?

User: I’ve been distracted. When I think about English, I can’t focus on anything else. It's like this cloud over me.

Consultant: That’s understandable—it can be hard to concentrate when you feel anxious about one particular subject. It might help to create a schedule that includes some time for English study alongside your other subjects. How do you feel about that?

User: A schedule sounds useful! I might be able to balance my time better and not feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline a simple study schedule that includes time for English and other subjects. How about starting with 30 minutes for English and then moving on to another subject? You could then take a short break.

User: That could work! Having breaks might help me clear my mind.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking breaks can help prevent burnout. How do you typically think about taking breaks: do you view them positively or negatively?

User: I used to feel guilty about taking breaks, like I should always be studying. But now I see it can help me stay fresh.

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to view it. Breaks are essential for maintaining your focus and energy. Reflecting on these changes, what are you most looking forward to in your study routine?

User: I think I’m most excited about the idea of achieving those small goals. It makes it feel less impossible.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Celebrating small success helps build a sense of accomplishment. Now, considering your relationship with your grandpa, how have you two been getting along recently? 

User: We've been okay. Sometimes we have fights, especially when I’m stressed. I worry about him, too, since he’s not well.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about your grandpa, especially during your own stressful times. Have you thought about how you could improve your communication with him during those tense moments?

User: I guess I could try to talk to him more calmly when I’m feeling anxious. He’s always trying to help.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach, D. Open communication can really strengthen your bond. And remember, it’s okay to express your worries, too. Is there something specific you’d like to share with him about how you’re feeling?

User: I’d like him to know that I appreciate his help, even if I don’t always show it.

Consultant: That's a heartfelt message to share. Perhaps you could take small moments to express that gratitude. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you feel more confident about moving forward, whether in your studies or your family life?

User: I feel more confident about managing my study time better and talking to my grandpa about how I feel. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic, D! It sounds like you’ve gained some valuable insights today. Remember, it’s a journey, and taking these steps will help you move forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m truly glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this. I look forward to our next session, and don’t hesitate to jot down any reflections you have in the meantime. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling recently, especially with your grandpa being in the hospital?

User: Hi. It's been tough. I worry about my grandpa's health a lot. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed trying to manage everything at home, and I still struggle with my studies, especially English.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re facing a lot right now with your grandpa's health and the pressure at school. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you share more about how you’ve been coping with these feelings?

User: Well, I try to help out at home as much as I can. It feels good to support my grandpa, but sometimes I just feel sad and frustrated because I’m not studying well. 

Consultant: It’s great that you’re contributing and supporting your grandpa, D. Balancing that with school can be really challenging. When you feel sad or frustrated about your studies, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: Sometimes I think that I’ll just never get better at English. I feel like I’m falling behind and it makes me want to give up.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough when you feel like progress isn’t happening. Could you identify how those thoughts make you feel in that moment? 

User: They make me feel really defeated. Like, no matter how hard I try, it just doesn’t work out.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel defeated when you think there’s no progress. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you won’t improve in English? 

User: I guess, some topics I just don’t get, and I see other students doing better. 

Consultant: That’s a fair point. But can we consider other explanations? Is it possible that those students might just have different strengths or learning styles?

User: Maybe. I haven’t thought of it that way. I just see them doing well and feel worse about myself.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, but remember, everyone has their own journey. What if we switched the focus? How can you redefine your goals in a way that feels more attainable?

User: I could aim to improve little by little instead of trying to be perfect right away. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent approach! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you feel more in control. How about focusing on one aspect of English each week? 

User: That makes sense. I think I could try that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, about your grandpa—how are you feeling about your relationship with him lately?

User: It's actually getting better. I talk to him more since he’s at home, and it helps us connect.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like those conversations are beneficial for both of you. How does connecting with him make you feel?

User: It makes me feel happy, like I’m doing something right, but then I worry again about him being sick. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel those mixed emotions. Supporting him can bring joy, but the worry is still there. Let's think about ways to manage that worry. What do you do when those anxious thoughts about his health come up?

User: I usually just distract myself with video games or TV. It helps a bit.

Consultant: Distractions can be helpful in the short term, but they don’t always address the underlying feelings. How would you feel about trying some different coping strategies, like spending a few minutes writing about your feelings or talking them out with someone you trust?

User: I can try that. It sounds like it could help. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step, D. Writing your feelings may help you process them effectively. Now, as we work together, what would be your goal for our next session?

User: I’d like to feel more confident about managing both my schoolwork and my feelings about my grandpa's health. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! We’ll explore strategies to boost your confidence and help you feel more stable emotionally. Finally, let’s think about one positive action you can take this week that could enhance your self-image. 

User: Maybe I can set a small study goal and check in with myself about how I’m feeling too. 

Consultant: I love that idea! Setting a study goal along with a check-in will help you stay aware of your emotions. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thanks. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re making wonderful progress, D. I believe you can achieve your goals, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then! 

User: Thanks! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you've had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! Yeah, I feel pretty good about the recognition I got from my teacher and classmates during our class activity. It's nice to feel valued, but sometimes I worry about whether I can keep it up.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear you felt valued and recognized! That’s a significant achievement. It’s completely natural to be concerned about maintaining that feeling. Let's explore what made that experience positive for you. What part of it stood out the most?

User: I think it was when I saw my classmates and teacher smiling at me and giving me compliments. It felt really nice to hear that I did well, especially since I've been struggling recently.

Consultant: That sounds like a really uplifting moment for you, and it’s great that you could connect with your classmates and teacher in that way. How did that recognition affect your overall self-image?

User: I guess it made me feel a bit more confident about myself. It’s like I remembered that I can do well if I try. But I still have a hard time in subjects like English, which sometimes brings me back down.

Consultant: It makes sense that your struggles in English might overshadow your successes in other areas. Let’s think about that achievement you had. How might you use that positive feeling to help you tackle the challenges in English?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I can succeed if I prepare properly, just like I did for that activity. But whenever I think about English homework, I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a great insight, D! It's true that preparation can really help. When you start to feel overwhelmed, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I’ll never understand it well or that I’m just not good at English. Those thoughts make me want to give up.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts can really weigh you down and make you feel discouraged. What if we try to challenge those thoughts? Can you think of any evidence that suggests you can understand English better?

User: Well, I did manage to improve a bit during the last exam. So, I guess that shows I can learn if I put in the effort.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! You’ve made progress, and that’s an important piece of evidence. Let’s focus on that progress and think about how you can build on it. What might help you feel less overwhelmed when studying English?

User: Maybe breaking it down into smaller tasks could help. I could focus on one topic at a time instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Breaking it down can make it feel more manageable. How about we create a small action plan together for your next week of English study?

User: Sure! I think I could start by reviewing vocabulary first, then tackle some grammar exercises.

Consultant: Excellent! That’s a great start. Setting up a routine might also help keep you on track. Alongside this, let’s also remember the recognition you received as motivation. How will you keep that feeling alive as you study?

User: I could write down some positive comments I received and look at them when I feel down. That might help remind me of what I can achieve.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Creating a reminder of your achievements can serve as a wonderful motivator. How do you feel about this approach? 

User: I feel good about it! It’s reassuring to have some strategies to use. I just hope I can stick with it.

Consultant: Your optimism is encouraging, and remember it's completely normal to have ups and downs. What’s important is that you're willing to try. Let’s check in next time to see how this plan worked for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’m looking forward to sharing my progress.

Consultant: I am too! Just keep in mind, you’re already building a foundation of self-confidence. You're capable of facing these challenges. Enjoy your week, and I'll see you next time!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. See you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm really glad to see you again today. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I think I'm feeling good overall. I've been getting used to my new school and making friends, which feels nice. But sometimes I still feel a bit unsure about my studies, especially in English.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making positive strides in adapting to your new environment and socializing with your peers. That's great to hear! Let's talk a bit more about your studies. How do you feel when you're working on your English assignments?

User: I often feel frustrated because I don’t understand some of the material. It makes me doubt whether I can improve.

Consultant: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. It’s normal to feel a bit lost when faced with something challenging. Have you noticed any thoughts that come to your mind when you struggle with your English work?

User: I tend to think things like "I’ll never get it" or "I’m just not good at this." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty harsh, and it’s easy to see why they could make you feel discouraged. Can we explore what evidence supports these thoughts? Are there any instances where you felt successful with English or similar challenges?

User: Well, I did manage to communicate a little better with my classmates during a group project last week. I guess that felt good.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, D! It's important to recognize those moments of success. What would you tell a friend who felt the way you do about their studies?

User: I suppose I’d tell them not to give up and to keep trying. I’d encourage them to focus on what they do understand.

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! It shows you have a compassionate perspective toward yourself and others. How might you apply that same mindset to your own English studies moving forward?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to struggle and that I can improve gradually. I should also celebrate little victories.

Consultant: Yes! Celebrating your progress, no matter how small, can help build your confidence. Can we think about some specific actions you can take in your English studies this week?

User: I can set aside time each day to practice and maybe join a study group with friends who can help me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Engaging with friends in study groups can provide support and make learning more enjoyable. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel excited! It’ll be more fun to work with others, and I think it’ll help me improve.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that excitement! As we approach the end of our sessions, let’s reflect on how far you’ve come. What do you consider your biggest growth during our time together?

User: I think my biggest growth is learning how to tackle challenges better and being more confident in myself. 

Consultant: That’s a remarkable realization, D. You’ve worked hard, and your progress is commendable. What strategies do you think you’ll rely on in the future to maintain this growth?

User: I will keep reminding myself of my successes and stay open to seeking help when I need it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach. It’s essential to have those strategies in place. As we conclude our sessions, remember that it’s okay to reach out if you ever feel overwhelmed again. You have already built a solid foundation for yourself.

User: Thanks! I appreciate all your help. I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep exploring your interests and building on that confidence. You have a bright future ahead of you. Whenever you need support, don't hesitate to come back.

User: I will! Thank you so much for everything!

Consultant: Take care, D! Best wishes on your journey ahead!
