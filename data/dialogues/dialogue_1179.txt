Consultant: Hello, Wu! Welcome to today’s session. How are you feeling right now, especially with everything that's been going on in your life?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite lonely and overwhelmed lately. I just can’t seem to adjust to university life and often feel lost, especially when I can’t find my classes. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like this transition to university has been quite challenging for you. Feeling lost and overwhelmed can be tough. Can you share more about what specific situations are making you feel this way?

User: Well, there have been multiple times I’ve entered the wrong classroom, and it makes me feel embarrassed. Plus, I tried to distract myself by shopping, but now I’m worried about my finances. It's like I'm not in control of my life.

Consultant: I hear you. Finding the wrong classroom can definitely lead to feelings of embarrassment and doubt. And on top of that, dealing with finances adds another layer of stress. What do you think would help you feel more in control, both in your daily routine and with your finances?

User: I guess if I had a plan for my day and some strategies to manage my money better, I wouldn’t feel so anxious. But I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Having a plan can create a sense of structure. Why don’t we start with your daily routine? What does a typical day look like for you right now?

User: My mornings are usually rushed; I wake up late, miss breakfast, and then I’m off to class in a hurry. After classes, I often end up shopping mindlessly, then regret it later.

Consultant: It sounds like your mornings could really benefit from a more organized structure. How would you feel about setting specific times for waking up, meals, and your classes? This could help you feel less rushed and more in control.

User: That might actually help! I haven’t thought about organizing my mornings like that. I just need to stop feeling so overwhelmed. But then there’s the money issue…

Consultant: I understand that’s a significant concern for you. Let’s address that as well. Can you tell me about how you handle your finances currently? 

User: I just spend when I feel like it, and now I'm realizing I'm running low on money. I feel so ashamed.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel that way. Many people struggle with managing their finances, especially when they’re trying to adjust to a new environment. What if we explore some budgeting techniques together? 

User: I’d like that. I really want to learn how to budget better so I can avoid feeling guilty after shopping.

Consultant: Fantastic! One approach is to track your expenses for a week. You can categorize them, like necessities versus leisure. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I think if I could see where my money goes, it might help me make better choices. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Awareness is a great first step. Additionally, we could discuss setting a spending limit for leisure activities to help keep your finances in check.

User: Yes, I think that would help curb my impulse shopping. I just feel like I have so much to learn.

Consultant: It’s a learning process, and it’s okay to take one step at a time. Let’s also revisit your feelings of loneliness. What other social strategies do you think might help you connect with others?

User: I’ve thought about joining some clubs, but I haven’t been brave enough to go alone.

Consultant: Joining clubs can be a great way to meet new people. How about setting a small goal for yourself, like attending one club meeting this week? You can start gradually to build your confidence.

User: That doesn’t sound too intimidating, I could give it a try!

Consultant: That's the spirit! Small steps can lead to meaningful change. Once you do attend, how about reflecting on how it made you feel afterward?

User: I will. It’ll be interesting to see if I feel any different after meeting new people.

Consultant: Yes, definitely! And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Many others in that situation might feel the same, and it could be a great opportunity for connection. 

User: True, I hadn’t thought of it that way. I suppose everyone is adjusting just like me.

Consultant: Exactly! With time, these adjustments will feel less daunting. As we wrap up, what do you feel are your most significant takeaways from our conversation today?

User: I think having a plan for my mornings and tracking my spending feels manageable. Also, the idea of joining a club seems like a good way to meet people.

Consultant: That's excellent! You’ve identified some actionable steps that can help reduce your anxiety. How do you feel about moving forward with these ideas?

User: I feel hopeful, but also a little nervous. Still, I think I can do it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mixture of emotions. Acknowledging them is part of the process. If you need support along the way, remember that’s what we're here for. You’re making progress!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I feel a bit more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. We’ll continue to work together on these concerns. Take care until our next session!

User: See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today. I understand you’re feeling a bit anxious about managing your finances. Can you tell me more about what's been troubling you lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really worried about my spending. My lifestyle has gone a bit out of control, and now I have to ask my family for help. It makes me feel really embarrassed and incapable.

Consultant: I can see why that would be stressful for you. Wanting to be financially independent is important, and it’s understandable to feel uncomfortable asking for help. What specifically about your spending has caused the most concern for you?

User: I tend to buy things I don't really need, and before I know it, my budget is totally off. I feel guilty for not being more responsible with my money.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel a lot of guilt surrounding your spending habits. Let's explore this further. When you make those purchases, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think it's just a little treat for myself or that I deserve it. But then I realize I've spent a lot more than I planned.

Consultant: So, it seems like you're balancing between wanting to reward yourself and the reality of what those purchases mean for your finances. What emotions come up for you after you make those purchases?

User: I often feel a mix of excitement at first, but then it quickly turns to anxiety and shame once I realize what I've done.

Consultant: That’s a tough cycle to be caught in—feeling excited initially, only to be met with anxiety and shame afterward. Let’s think about the thoughts that lead to those purchases. Could we identify if there are any cognitive distortions at play here? For instance, do you find any thoughts that may be overly negative or unrealistic about your finances?

User: I guess I sometimes think that if I don’t treat myself, I'll feel miserable. But I also know that it leads to bigger problems.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. It sounds like you might be engaging in all-or-nothing thinking. Treating yourself is important, but it’s also crucial to find a balance. How do you think you could approach your spending differently?

User: Maybe I could set specific limits on my spending or plan my budget ahead of time? But I'm not sure how to start.

Consultant: That's a good idea! Creating a budget is a practical first step. Let’s explore how we can outline a budget together. What are your regular sources of income and necessary expenses?

User: I have my allowance from my family, but most of it goes to rent and food. I’m left with very little for anything else.

Consultant: Understanding your income and necessary expenses is essential for budgeting. Let's write that down. How much do you think you can set aside for discretionary spending each month?

User: I think I could allocate maybe $50 to $75 for extra things, if I really plan well.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable start! Would it help to track your spending for a month to see where that money actually goes? 

User: Yes, that could help me see if I’m sticking to the budget or not.

Consultant: Great! Keeping a log can really open your eyes to your spending habits. After that, we can adjust as needed. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I’m a little nervous, but also relieved to have a plan in place.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous about changes, but having a plan can really help. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Are there any other tools or strategies you think might help you stick to your budget?

User: Maybe I could set reminders on my phone to check in with my budget regularly?

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Setting reminders can keep you accountable. How often do you think would be a good pace for those reminders?

User: Perhaps once a week? Just to check if I’m on track.

Consultant: Weekly check-ins sound perfect. They can give you an opportunity to reflect and make adjustments as needed. How does discussing your budget with someone close to you sound? Could it relieve some pressure?

User: I could talk to a close friend. That might actually help me stay accountable.

Consultant: Excellent! Sharing your goals with a friend can provide you with encouragement and support. How do you feel about the progress we've made today?

User: I feel more in control now. I still worry about messing up, but at least I have a plan to follow.

Consultant: It’s normal to worry, but having a plan is a big step in the right direction. Let’s summarize what we've discussed to reinforce your learning.

User: Sure, we talked about identifying my spending problems and setting up a budget.

Consultant: That’s right! You’ll track your spending, allocate some funds for fun, and establish weekly reminders. What do you think will be your biggest challenge moving forward?

User: I think sticking to the budget and avoiding impulse buys will be my biggest challenge.

Consultant: Acknowledging that challenge is an important step. Remember, it’s about making progress, not being perfect. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always revisit our strategies, and I'll be here to help!

User: Thank you! I’m feeling a bit better about everything, actually.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Today was a significant step forward. Let’s continue to build on this in our future sessions. You’re capable of making these changes! 

User: I appreciate your support. I’ll do my best to follow through.

Consultant: You’ve got this! Remember that every small step counts. Looking forward to our next session where we can check in on your progress!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you could join me today. I understand you've been feeling a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed about a recent event involving your life skills. Can you share more about how you've been feeling since then?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling pretty embarrassed since the incident. It was silly of me to mix my pillow and pillowcase in water, and my classmates laughed at me. Now I'm doubting my ability to handle everyday tasks.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's completely normal to feel embarrassed in situations like that. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Can you tell me more about what specifically bothers you about your life skills right now?

User: I just feel like I should know how to manage basic things by now, like doing laundry or cooking. But whenever I try, I keep getting it wrong, and it makes me feel inadequate.

Consultant: I hear you; it can be frustrating when we feel we should have certain skills but struggle with them. Let’s explore this together. What kinds of everyday tasks do you find particularly challenging?

User: Well, definitely laundry... and cooking too. I feel anxious even thinking about trying to cook something new. I worry I'll mess it up and feel embarrassed again.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about trying new tasks, especially after feeling embarrassed before. What do you think would help you feel a bit more confident when approaching these tasks?

User: I think having a clear plan or some guidelines would help. But I don't even know where to start to learn these skills.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Having a structured approach can definitely alleviate some anxiety. Would you be open to creating a simple plan together for one of the tasks you're interested in improving, like cooking or laundry? 

User: Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe starting with laundry? It seems like a more manageable task.

Consultant: Absolutely, laundry is a great place to start! Let’s break it down step by step. What do you believe is the first step in doing laundry?

User: I guess the first step would be sorting the clothes by color?

Consultant: Correct! Sorting is indeed the first step. From there, we can look at washing settings and detergent. Have you ever done that before?

User: I have, but I wasn’t sure how to choose the right settings. It was overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can feel complicated at first. What if we looked into the basic settings together and I guided you through what each one means?

User: I would really appreciate that! It helps to have someone explain it. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s break down the wash settings that most machines use. Most importantly, there’s usually a warm setting for colors and a cold setting to prevent shrinking. Would that make you feel more comfortable?

User: Yes, it does! Just knowing what to do makes a difference.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s perfectly fine to start small and gradually learn more. As you gain confidence in this area, we can explore cooking next. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel a bit less anxious now knowing where to start.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It’s all about taking small steps. Besides laundry, what other life skills or tasks do you feel you’d like to improve next?

User: Cooking, definitely. I really want to learn how to make some easy meals.

Consultant: Great choice! Cooking can be really rewarding. Would you like to set a goal for a simple dish you could try making within the next week?

User: Maybe I could try making scrambled eggs. I’ve seen it done so many times.

Consultant: Scrambled eggs are a fantastic starting point! They’re simple and quick to make. Would you feel comfortable practicing that this week?

User: Yes, I think I can manage that! Just having it as a goal feels good.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it's perfectly fine if it doesn’t turn out perfect on the first try. What matters is that you're trying and learning. 

User: I guess I need to be kinder to myself when things don't go as planned. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion is key, especially when learning new skills. How do you think you can remind yourself to be kinder to yourself as you practice?

User: Maybe I can write positive notes to myself or talk to myself differently when I make mistakes.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Positive self-talk can make a big difference. Would you like to come up with a few affirmations together?

User: Sure! Maybe something like "It's okay to make mistakes" or "I'm learning and improving."

Consultant: Those are wonderfully supportive affirmations! You can remind yourself of these whenever you feel anxious about your tasks. How do you feel about your journey towards enhancing your life skills now?

User: I feel hopeful. I know I still have a long way to go, but now I feel more prepared to take on these challenges.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling to have! Remember, every small step you take is progress. Before we end today’s session, is there anything else you’d like to share or discuss?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I'm feeling better about everything now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! We’ve made some fantastic progress today. If you can, keep me updated on how your laundry and cooking go next time we meet. You’ve got this!

User: I will! Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Wu! I'm glad you're here today. You've mentioned feeling lonely but wanting to connect more with people, which is a great first step. Can you share a bit about what made you decide to increase your interactions with classmates recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I think I just realized that being alone all the time isn't making me happy. I’ve tried chatting with a few classmates, but I still feel kind of distant. It's hard to build deeper friendships.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can be challenging to feel connected, especially when you’re used to being alone. What feelings come up for you when you try to connect with your classmates?

User: I often feel anxious and awkward. It’s like I want to say something, but I can’t find the right words. Sometimes, I worry about what they think of me.

Consultant: It sounds like those fears about their perception are holding you back a bit. Let's explore that a little. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you feel anxious like this?

User: I often think that they might find me boring or that I won’t fit in. I guess there are fears of rejection.

Consultant: Those thoughts are very common when we try to socialize. Sometimes our minds overemphasize the negative possibilities. Would it help if we challenged some of those thoughts together? For instance, what evidence do you have that suggests they would find you boring?

User: I don’t have clear evidence, to be honest. It’s just this feeling I have.

Consultant: That feeling is valid, but it doesn’t always reflect reality. Think about the conversations you’ve had. Have you noticed anything that contradicted that feeling when you spoke with your classmates?

User: Well, sometimes they seem engaged and interested in what I'm saying, but then I just get overwhelmed and shut down.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve noticed that engagement! It shows that you have potential connections. Let’s consider how we can build on this. How about we role-play a scenario where you initiate a conversation? What kind of thing would you like to talk about?

User: Maybe I could ask them about their study habits. That seems safe enough.

Consultant: Perfect choice! Now, let’s practice that. I’ll play your classmate, and you can start with your question.

User: Okay… um, “Hey, how do you usually study for exams?” 

Consultant: That’s a good start! How do you think I might respond?

User: Maybe I would say something like, “Oh, I use flashcards!” 

Consultant: Exactly, and then you can ask me more about that or share a bit about your own study methods. How do you feel practicing this way?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also kind of excited. It’s helpful to think of it as a casual chat rather than a big deal.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Keeping it casual can break the ice. Let’s set a small goal for you this week. How about aiming to initiate just one conversation with a classmate, perhaps about study habits or classes?

User: I think I can do that! Just one conversation seems more manageable.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m proud of you for taking this step. As you work on this, notice how it feels and any thoughts that come to mind afterward. We can discuss it in our next session. 

User: Sure! I’m really looking forward to it. I think I can push myself a little.

Consultant: I believe in you! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. It’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. Every effort counts. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident after talking to you.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Before we end today, let’s recap what you've learned about yourself and your feelings towards socializing.

User: I learned that a lot of my worries are just in my head. I also realized that I can take small steps to improve.

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging those thoughts and taking small steps can be a game-changer. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Me too! Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Wu! Remember, each day is a new opportunity. If you need help or encouragement in between, feel free to reach out. 

User: I appreciate that! I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: Great! Take care of yourself, and I’m excited about your progress. See you next time!

User: See you! I feel more motivated now.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wu! I'm glad to see you today. I remember you mentioned feeling more confident after your recent group task. How has this change impacted you?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel more recognized and appreciated now. It's been nice, but I still worry about keeping this momentum going. I want to participate in more activities and build on this confidence.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you feel appreciated! It sounds like you're eager to maintain that confidence and explore new opportunities. Can you tell me more about any activities you’re considering?

User: Well, I've thought about joining a club or maybe a workshop, but I haven’t decided yet. I sometimes feel uncertain about what I would enjoy.

Consultant: Exploring clubs or workshops can be a fantastic way to build on your recent achievements! What interests you in those areas? What kind of activities feel appealing to you?

User: I enjoy creative things like art or writing, but I’ve never really pursued them seriously. I guess there's a part of me that worries I won't be good enough.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those worries. Often, we set high standards for ourselves. What if we looked at it this way: exploring art or writing could be about expressing yourself rather than focusing on how skilled you are at it?

User: That makes sense. I guess if I don’t put too much pressure on myself, I could just enjoy the process. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Enjoying the process is key. What would it feel like to approach these activities without the expectation of perfection? 

User: I think it would be a relief! I'd probably feel more free to create without overthinking it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great shift in perspective. It might be helpful to remind yourself that any effort in pursuing what you enjoy is a success. How do you think acknowledging your small victories could support your journey?

User: I could start by celebrating completing small projects, rather than just focusing on the overall outcome. It might help me feel more accomplished along the way.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Recognizing those small victories can significantly reinforce your motivation. Is there a small project you're thinking about starting first?

User: Maybe I could try making some sketches or write short stories. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful start! How about setting a specific, manageable goal for this week regarding your sketches or stories?

User: I could aim to sketch something every day for ten minutes or write a little bit each day. That feels doable!

Consultant: Perfect! Setting aside just ten minutes can make a big difference. How do you feel about committing to that goal?

User: I feel excited about it! I'm looking forward to having that time to express myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Wu! You'll be giving yourself a chance to explore and enjoy your creativity. How can we ensure you keep track of your progress and feelings during this week?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal. I could write about my sketches or stories and how they made me feel.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent choice! It will allow you to reflect on your experiences and celebrate your progress. How can you remind yourself to check in with your journal throughout the week?

User: I could set a reminder on my phone or tie it to the end of my day, just before I relax.

Consultant: Great strategy! Creating a consistent time for it will help you form that habit. As you begin to pursue these creative outlets, how do you believe your confidence may shift?

User: I hope it will grow even more! If I see my creations, even if they're imperfect, it might reinforce that I can do this.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about the journey, not just the outcome. What kind of support do you think you might need during this exploration to enhance that feeling of security and belonging?

User: I think it would help to share my work with friends or maybe even invite them to join me. It would feel more inclusive.

Consultant: Involving friends can be a wonderful way to share experiences and feel more connected. How do you think your relationships can keep growing through this process?

User: I hope I can bond with them over our shared interests and motivate each other to try new things.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Connections like that can really enhance your experience. As we wrap up today, what are you taking away from this session?

User: I feel more confident about pursuing my interests and the stability of having friends supports me. I’m excited to start my creative journey!

Consultant: I'm so proud of you for the steps you’re willing to take! You've shown great insight into your feelings and goals. Always remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wu! I'm glad to see you today. Let's take a moment to reflect on your recent experiences and feelings. How are you feeling about the support and encouragement from your family?

User: Hi! I feel really grateful for their support. It's nice to know that they appreciate my efforts in school. It gives me a sense of stability, but sometimes I wonder if I'm truly living up to their expectations.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you feel supported by your family. It's natural to have concerns about meeting expectations. Can you share what those expectations are and how they affect you?

User: They often praise my academic achievements, which makes me feel proud. However, I sometimes fear that if I don't maintain that level of performance, they might be disappointed in me.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot of pressure to maintain those achievements. How does this pressure affect your day-to-day emotions and interactions?

User: It makes me a bit anxious actually. I tend to isolate myself because I don't want to let them down. I also worry that I might miss out on social opportunities because I'm too focused on my studies.

Consultant: I understand. Balancing academic responsibilities and social opportunities can indeed be challenging. What would you like to prioritize more—your studies or your social life?

User: I think both are important, but I often prioritize my studies over socializing, which ends up making me feel lonely at times.

Consultant: It's great that you've recognized that feeling of loneliness. Let’s explore how you could integrate more social activities into your routine. What are some ways you might engage socially while also keeping up with your studies?

User: I guess I could try to join a study group. That way, I can study and socialize at the same time, right?

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Joining a study group can provide both academic support and social interaction. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think it could be helpful. I'm just afraid of not fitting in or holding others back.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal, Wu. Remember, everyone in the group is there to learn and support each other. What strategies can we think of to help you feel more comfortable when joining the group?

User: Maybe I can focus on just being myself and asking questions when I need help. Also, I could remind myself that they probably feel nervous too.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective! It’s important to be kind to yourself and remember that everyone has their own insecurities. Would it help to set some small goals for your first session with the group?

User: Yes! Perhaps I can aim to say something during the first meeting, like an introduction or a question about the material we are studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Small steps can lead to significant changes. How do you feel about setting this as your goal for the study group?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. Setting a small goal makes it seem more achievable. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Let's also discuss how you can manage your time effectively, so you can balance studying and socializing. Do you have a study schedule that you follow?

User: I do have a schedule, but I'm not always disciplined about sticking to it.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can definitely help. What if we worked together to refine your schedule to include specific study and social times? 

User: That would be helpful. I could allocate certain evenings for study groups and keep my mornings for focused study.

Consultant: Perfect! By creating designated times for both studying and socializing, you'll feel more balanced. How do you think committing to this plan might impact your feelings of anxiety?

User: I believe it could lower my anxiety because I’d feel like I'm making progress in both areas rather than stressing about one at the expense of the other.

Consultant: Absolutely, balancing both can lead to more contentment. As we wrap up today, what key points can you take away from our discussion regarding your social and study strategies?

User: I learned that it's okay to seek help and that I don't have to be alone in my studies. Joining a study group can be a way to connect with others, and setting small, achievable goals will help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights, Wu. It's all about finding a balance that works for you. As you move forward, remember to be patient with yourself and to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and feel more prepared to tackle this.

Consultant: You are very welcome! It was great to talk today. If you ever need further support, feel free to reach out. You're making wonderful progress. See you next time!
