Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding school and your interactions with classmates?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really frustrated. My grades have been fluctuating, and I just feel nervous when I’m in class. I worry a lot about what my classmates think of me.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety when it comes to your performance in school and social interactions. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel nervous in those situations?

User: I just get really anxious when I have to speak up in class or group activities. I often feel that people are judging me, and it makes it hard to focus on what I want to say.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging, feeling like you’re being judged. It’s understandable to feel anxious in those moments. Have there been any recent experiences in class that really stood out to you?

User: Yes, last week I had to present a project, and I was so afraid I would mess it up. I stuttered, and I could see some classmates giggling. It made me feel even worse.

Consultant: I can imagine how that must have felt. It’s tough to present when you’re already feeling anxious. What thoughts were going through your mind during the presentation, especially when you noticed the giggles?

User: I thought that I was terrible and that everyone would remember my mistakes. It made me feel like I shouldn’t even try anymore.

Consultant: It’s hard not to let those thoughts affect how you feel about yourself. Those thoughts can be really powerful. Do you think there might be other ways to view what happened during your presentation?

User: Maybe... but it’s hard to think positively when I feel like I've embarrassed myself in front of everyone.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can be really difficult to shift our perspective when we feel embarrassed. If a friend were to tell you they experienced the same situation, how do you think you would respond to them?

User: I would probably tell them that it happens to everyone and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves. They should just try again next time.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response. It shows you have the ability to be kind to others. Let’s try to apply that kindness to yourself as well. It’s okay to make mistakes, and they don’t define your ability or worth. How does that idea make you feel?

User: It feels a bit comforting to think that mistakes are normal, but I still struggle to believe it for myself.

Consultant: That’s a good start, though! Acknowledging that comfort is important. One approach we can consider is to gradually expose yourself to situations that make you anxious, starting small. Is there a particular social situation you would feel comfortable trying to practice in?

User: Maybe joining a small group for a game or something like that? But I’m still nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Joining a group for a game can be a low-pressure way to interact. Perhaps we can set a goal for you to participate in such a group this week. What do you think?

User: I think I could try that. But what if I still feel anxious?

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel anxious. What’s important is to acknowledge that feeling and still take the step to join in. You might find that, even if you feel nervous, the experience could turn out to be more positive than expected. How about we plan some supportive phrases you can say to yourself during that time?

User: That sounds helpful! What should I say?

Consultant: You could tell yourself: “It’s okay to feel nervous; I’m here to have fun and learn,” or “Everyone makes mistakes, and that’s part of life.” Having those phrases ready can help you navigate those feelings. How does that sound?

User: I like that! It gives me something to focus on instead of just the anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, being aware of your thoughts can help you respond differently. How about we also talk about what you can do if you feel overwhelmed during the game?

User: Maybe I could take a break or remind myself to breathe slowly if I start to feel really anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Taking a break or using deep breathing can be very effective. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, that would be nice.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold for a moment... and now breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of four. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I think I can use this when I'm anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoming! Remember, these techniques take practice, and it's okay to use them when you need to. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s important to be kinder to myself and to keep trying even if I feel nervous. I want to practice some of these skills in the game this week.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! I’m proud of you for considering these steps. Remember, it’s okay to seek support when you need it. You’re not alone in this journey. I look forward to hearing how your experience goes next time we meet. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling a bit down, especially after that group activity at school. It was really hard when some classmates were unkind, and I just felt left out.

Consultant: I can understand how disappointing and frustrating that must have felt. It sounds like that experience has intensified your feelings of avoidance in social situations. Could you tell me more about what specifically upset you during that activity?

User: Well, I wanted to join in and make some friends, but it seemed like everyone was ignoring me. It felt like I wasn’t even there, and that really hurt.

Consultant: It’s really tough to feel invisible, especially when you're trying to connect with others. Your feelings of frustration are completely valid. Let’s explore some strategies that might help you feel more included next time. What do you think you could try when you feel ignored?

User: I’m not sure. Maybe just try harder to join in, but I worry they’ll just ignore me again.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. It’s completely understandable to feel apprehensive. Let’s think about this: What if you approached one person and initiated a conversation? How do you think that might change your experience?

User: I guess if I talked to one person, it would be less scary than trying to join a big group. But what if they don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: That’s a valid worry. However, it might be helpful to consider that not every interaction will go the way we hope. It’s crucial to remember that one rejection doesn’t define your worth. If you do get a positive response, it could be a little step toward making a new friend. How might you feel about trying that approach?

User: I think it could be worth a try. But I still get anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s practice some techniques to tackle that anxiety. One method is to identify and challenge the thoughts that make you anxious. What thoughts cross your mind when you think about approaching someone?

User: I think things like “They will think I'm weird,” or “What if they laugh at me?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly increase your anxiety. Let’s challenge them together. For instance, what evidence do you have that they will think you're weird or laugh at you? 

User: Well, I don’t have any real evidence. It’s just how I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to recognize that these feelings don’t always reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what might you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I’d probably say they’re being too hard on themselves and that it’s okay to be different.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, let’s think about creating some positive affirmations you can remind yourself of when you feel that way. For example, “It’s okay to be myself” or “I have something unique to offer.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I can try to remember those phrases.

Consultant: Great! Building self-confidence takes practice. Is there a social situation coming up where you could try applying these ideas? 

User: There’s another group activity next week. Maybe I can try to talk to someone before it starts.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent opportunity! Aiming to engage with someone beforehand is a fantastic start. Remember to focus on your positive affirmations when anxiety arises. How are you feeling about this plan? 

User: I feel a little nervous, but also a bit excited. Maybe it won't be so bad.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude to have! It’s okay to feel nervous. It often means you’re stepping outside of your comfort zone, which can lead to growth. How about we role-play what you might say to start a conversation?

User: Okay, that sounds helpful!

Consultant: Alright! Let’s pretend I’m someone you’re meeting at the group activity. What would you say to start the conversation?

User: Hi! I’m Xiaoming. What do you think about this activity?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opener! It’s friendly and shows your interest in the activity. Practice this a few times until you feel comfortable. How are you feeling about this approach after our practice?

User: I think I can do this! It feels more manageable now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, every small step counts. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned that you can take with you to help you navigate your social situations?

User: I learned to challenge my negative thoughts and to try to engage with others more confidently.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Xiaoming! Keep practicing these skills, and remember, you’re not alone in this. If you ever feel overwhelmed, reach out for support. I believe in you! Until next time, keep building on what you've learned.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm glad you're here today. I know last time we talked about your new friendship. How have you been feeling about that since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my friendship. At first, it felt good, but then I became anxious again about how my friend views our relationship.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about friendships, especially when they are new. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been causing you to feel uneasy?

User: Well, sometimes I feel like my friend doesn't care as much as I do. When I try to talk to him, he's not always responsive, and I worry if he really wants to be my friend.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiao Ming. It’s common to want more from a friendship, and it can be unsettling when we feel the other person isn’t on the same page. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel like your friend isn't responding?

User: I think maybe I'm being too needy or maybe he thinks I'm not cool enough to be friends with. It makes me feel sad and confused.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those kinds of thoughts, and they often lead to feeling hurt. But let's explore this a bit more. What evidence do you have that suggests he thinks you aren’t cool enough? 

User: I don't really know. He laughs and plays with me sometimes. But when he's with other friends, he doesn't include me as much, and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: I see. It seems like you’re interpreting his actions in a way that makes you feel less valued. It's important to remember that friendships can be complicated. Sometimes, people are unaware of how their behavior affects others. Have you considered talking to your friend about how you're feeling?

User: I thought about it, but I’m worried he might think I’m overreacting or that I’m just being silly.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. However, expressing your feelings can actually strengthen the friendship, as it opens up communication. If you were to speak to him, how do you think he might respond?

User: Maybe he would understand and try to include me more. But then again, I’m also afraid he might not care.

Consultant: It's natural to have mixed feelings about this. One way to approach it is by focusing on what you'd like to communicate, rather than on the worst possible outcome. What would you want to say to him if you decided to share your feelings?

User: I guess I'd want to tell him that I really value our friendship and that I sometimes feel left out when he's with other friends.

Consultant: That's a great start! It expresses your feelings clearly and focuses on what matters to you. Remember, sharing how you feel can help him understand your perspective better. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit better thinking about saying that. It seems more constructive than just sitting with my worries.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're ready to take a positive step. Let’s talk about how you might approach this conversation. How would you feel about finding a good time and place to talk to him?

User: That sounds good. Maybe during lunch when it’s just the two of us. I think that could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect time! A more private setting can make it easier to discuss feelings. Do you have any other strategies that you think could help you prepare for this conversation?

User: I think I could practice what I want to say beforehand so I feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing is a wonderful idea! It can help ease your nerves. You might also consider what questions you’d like to ask him afterward to show you’re open to understanding his feelings too. What questions pop into your mind?

User: Maybe I could ask him if he enjoys spending time with me or if he wants to hang out more.

Consultant: Those are excellent questions! They show your interest in his feelings as well. How do you feel now about approaching this conversation with him?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. It feels like it could make things better.

Consultant: That hopefulness is a great sign! It's okay to feel nervous; it shows you care about your friendship. As you move forward, remember that friendships grow from communication and understanding. What do you think your next steps will be after this conversation?

User: I think I will keep trying to be a good friend and also remember that it's okay to feel anxious sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maintaining your effort while recognizing your feelings is a valuable approach. It’s a journey, and it's great to see you taking these steps. In our next session, we can review how it went and explore what you've learned. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to share how it goes next time. 

Consultant: Perfect! I'm looking forward to hearing about it. You've made some wonderful progress today, and I'm here to support you. Keep being brave, and feel free to reach out if you need anything before our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Ming! Take care, and we'll talk soon.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been working hard in social situations. How have you been feeling about your recent efforts in class discussions and group activities?

User: Hi! I've been trying my best to participate, but sometimes I still worry about how I'm doing. What if I say something silly or don't fit in?

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Let's explore those feelings together. Can you tell me more about what you think when you feel that way?

User: I often think that people might laugh at me if I make a mistake or I might not be understood. It makes me hesitate to speak up even though I want to.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety around what others might think. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and that it's a part of learning. What do you think are some positive things that have happened when you've participated in discussions?

User: Well, I've had some nice feedback from my teachers. They said I had good ideas. But sometimes I still focus on my fears instead of the good things.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiao Ming. It's fantastic that you've received positive feedback! Let's try to challenge those fears together. What evidence do you have that your ideas might not be received well? 

User: I guess the teachers did respond positively, and some classmates even nodded while I was speaking.

Consultant: That sounds like solid evidence to support that your contributions are valued! How might you remind yourself of these positive experiences when you feel anxious about speaking up again?

User: Maybe I can write down the compliments I’ve received and read them before speaking up in the future.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! By having reminders of your successes, you can build your confidence. Can you think of any situations coming up where you might want to try this strategy?

User: There’s a group project starting next week. I think I can try to share my thoughts more confidently.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How do you feel about the idea of sharing your thoughts during the project?

User: I feel a bit excited but still nervous. I really want to contribute.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way! Excitement and nervousness often go hand in hand. Maybe you can set a small goal, like speaking up at least once during the group meeting. Does that sound doable?

User: Yes, I think if I keep it simple and just share one idea, it might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping it simple can make a big difference. After that group meeting, let’s reflect on how it went next time. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I hope I can remember to focus on the positives.

Consultant: You're on the right track! Remember, recognizing and celebrating small accomplishments can significantly boost your self-esteem. Are there any other areas in your life where you feel like you’d like to take similar steps?

User: Maybe I could try speaking up more during lunch with friends. I usually just listen.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Starting small during lunch can help you gradually feel more comfortable. What kind of things do you think you'd like to share with your friends?

User: I could talk about the games we play or ask them about their favorite shows.

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! Sharing about things you enjoy can make it easier to connect with your friends. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel hopeful! If I start with what I like, it might be less scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your interests can make it a lot easier. Also, remember to give yourself credit for any progress you make, no matter how small. You’re doing great! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things at your own pace. As you continue to explore these social situations, keep reinforcing those positive experiences. What's the next step you would like to take after our session today?

User: I think I’ll start writing down my successes, as you suggested. And I’ll prepare for the group project.

Consultant: That's a great plan, Xiao Ming! I believe in you. When we meet next time, we can chat about how everything went. I’m excited to hear about your experiences!

User: Me too! Thank you so much for today. I feel much better about trying new things.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been wonderful talking with you. Keep up the good work, and remember that I’m here to support you whenever you need it. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! It’s great to have you here today. I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately, especially after that family gathering where you enjoyed talking to your relatives.

User: Hi! I felt really good about that. It was nice to talk to them and I realized I can actually enjoy socializing. I want to keep improving my communication skills and maybe find some hobbies that I like.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some great progress in social situations. Can you share more about what specific interests or hobbies you might want to explore?

User: I’ve been thinking about trying out drawing or maybe joining a sports team. I’ve always liked art, but I never really pursued it seriously.

Consultant: Art sounds like a fantastic avenue for you to explore. How do you feel about setting a small goal for your drawing? Perhaps you could aim to draw something a few times a week?

User: Yeah, I’d like that! Maybe I could start with simple things like doodles. It would be fun to see how I improve over time.

Consultant: Doodling can be a great way to ease into drawing! How about we also think of a way to reward yourself each time you complete a drawing? This could motivate you to keep going.

User: That sounds good! I can treat myself to some snacks or maybe a movie after I finish a drawing. I think that would help me stay interested.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Xiaoming! Rewards can really help reinforce positive habits. Now, besides drawing, how do you feel about participating in social activities, like joining a sports team?

User: I’m a little nervous about joining a team, but I think it could be fun. I’ve never played sports much, but I want to try it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous about new activities. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable when joining a sports team?

User: Maybe if I start with a friend who can join too, it would be less intimidating. I like the idea of having someone I know around.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having a friend with you can make the experience more enjoyable and less daunting. Have you considered talking to someone about joining a team together?

User: Not yet, but I could ask my classmate who likes soccer. I think he might be interested too.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Collaborating with your classmate can create a sense of support and companionship as you both explore this interest. How do you feel about reaching out to him?

User: I feel a bit anxious but also excited. I think I’ll ask him tomorrow!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Excitement is a good sign. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious—it’s part of trying something new. Would it help if we practiced what you might say to him?

User: Yeah, that could help! Maybe I could say, “Hey, do you want to join a soccer team with me?”

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! It’s straightforward and friendly. How would you feel if he responds positively to your invitation?

User: I think I’d feel really happy! It would mean I’m making progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, each step you take is progress. Now, let’s reflect a little on your recent achievements in socializing. How do you believe these experiences have impacted your self-esteem?

User: I feel more confident now. Talking to my relatives and being open about trying new things has made me realize I can handle social situations better than I thought.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that your confidence is growing! Recognizing your capabilities is crucial in maintaining a positive self-image. How can you keep this momentum going in other aspects of your life, like school or other social interactions?

User: I think I can try to participate in class more and maybe make small talk with my classmates. That would help me practice.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! Engaging in class discussions and initiating small conversations are excellent ways to enhance your social skills. Do you want to set a goal for how often you’ll try to do this?

User: Maybe I can start with aiming to speak up at least once in each class this week.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a very achievable goal. To help you remember, you could write it down somewhere you can see it often. How do you plan to feel once you complete this goal for the week?

User: I’ll feel proud of myself! It will show that I’m moving forward and I can do it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Celebrating your achievements is important. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what we worked on today. You’ve set goals for exploring drawing, possibly joining a sports team with a friend, and engaging more in class discussions. How do you feel about these plans?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to try these things and see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made great progress today, and I’m confident you’ll continue to build on these experiences. Remember, every small step counts. If challenges arise, just keep in mind the strategies we discussed today. You’re doing amazing work!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep trying. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Xiaoming! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Keep up the positive attitude, and remember, you can always reach out if you need support. Take care!

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel better about myself. My confidence in social situations has improved a lot. I even joined a club at school!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Joining a club is a big step. Can you tell me more about how you felt before joining and what made you decide to take that step? 

User: Before, I used to be shy and afraid of talking to others. But I thought I should give it a try because I want to make friends and get better at communicating.

Consultant: It's great that you recognized that desire to connect with others! It shows a lot of courage. How did it feel when you first participated in the club activities? 

User: At first, I was really nervous, but once I started talking to some members, it got easier. They were friendly and welcoming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you had a positive experience. What specific moments or interactions in the club made you feel more confident? 

User: I shared a project idea, and they seemed to like it! I felt really proud of myself for speaking up.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement! Feeling proud of yourself is so important. How do you think sharing your ideas in that moment contributed to your overall confidence? 

User: It made me realize that my thoughts matter. I want to share more ideas in the future.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiao Ming. Your input is valuable, and sharing it is a great way to build connections. Is there anything you're currently working on to keep developing this newfound confidence? 

User: I try to join discussions more often in class and talk to classmates during breaks. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Engaging in discussions and initiating conversations can really help. What has been the most rewarding part of these interactions for you so far? 

User: I've made a couple of friends who I talk to regularly now. It feels nice to have people to hang out with.

Consultant: Building friendships is such an enriching experience. As you continue to practice these social skills, what goals do you have in mind for your social interactions moving forward? 

User: I want to be able to make new friends more easily and not just stick to the same people.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Expanding your social circle can bring many rewarding experiences. Would you like to discuss some strategies to achieve that? 

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. 

Consultant: Great! One strategy could be to practice small talk with classmates you don't know well. What do you think about starting with a simple greeting or compliment? 

User: That sounds doable! I could say something nice about their backpack or something else. 

Consultant: Exactly! Compliments can be a great icebreaker. How would you feel about trying this approach in your next class? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous! Remember, taking small steps is key. And every time you try, you're building your confidence further. Would you like to set a specific goal on how many new classmates you want to talk to this week? 

User: Maybe I can aim to talk to two new people this week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable goal! Talking to two new people can be a great way to practice. How will you remind yourself to follow through with this? 

User: I can write it down in my planner to remember. 

Consultant: A planner is a wonderful tool for keeping track of your goals. It can also be helpful to reflect on how those conversations went afterward. Would you be willing to share your experiences with me in our next session? 

User: Yes, I’d like to do that! 

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about them. Remember, every effort you make counts, and you’re on the right path. How do you feel about our conversation today? 

User: I feel hopeful and excited about trying new things! 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You're making significant strides, and I’m proud of your progress. Let’s meet again soon to continue our work on these skills and tackle any challenges you encounter. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Ming! I'm here for you anytime you need guidance. Keep up the great work, and see you soon!
