Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you here today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really insecure about myself. I feel like I'm overweight and not very good-looking. It makes me anxious, especially during group activities at school. I worry about what my classmates think of me.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings of self-doubt and anxiety are quite overwhelming for you, particularly in social situations. Can you share more about how these feelings affect you during group activities?

User: Whenever there's a group project, I just want to hide. I can't shake off the fear of being judged or laughed at. I often stay silent, even when I have ideas to share.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating and isolating. It seems like you're stuck in a cycle where fear prevents you from expressing yourself. What do you think might happen if you shared your thoughts during those activities?

User: I fear that if I speak up, I'll say something silly or that everyone will think I'm not smart. I'd rather stay quiet to avoid drawing attention to myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. It sounds like you're worried about how others perceive you, which is a common experience. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts a bit deeper. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about participating?

User: I often think, "They'll laugh at me" or "I can't do this right." I just feel so inadequate compared to my peers.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful and can create a barrier for you. Can I ask, do you have any evidence that supports those thoughts? Have classmates told you that your contributions aren't valuable?

User: No, they haven't. In fact, I’ve heard them praise others for sharing their ideas. I guess it's just what I tell myself.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation. Our thoughts can sometimes be very convincing, even if they're not based on reality. What if we tried to replace those negative thoughts with something more balanced or positive? What might a more constructive thought look like?

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay to make mistakes, and my ideas are worth sharing"?

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds much healthier and more supportive. Practicing that kind of self-talk can help shift your perspective. How would you feel about trying to share an idea in your next group activity using that thought as a foundation?

User: I guess it would be a good challenge for me. I’d like to try that, but I’m still scared.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel scared, especially when stepping outside your comfort zone. Let’s look at what small steps you could take to gradually reduce that fear. Maybe starting with a comment you feel confident about could be a start. What do you think?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I could start by just agreeing or adding a little comment before going for a bigger idea.

Consultant: Great idea! Starting small can help build your confidence over time. Let's also think about how you can celebrate those small steps, regardless of the outcome. How might you acknowledge your courage in trying?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice or allow myself a break afterward for trying, even if it’s just a small comment.

Consultant: I love that strategy! Acknowledging your efforts is important. As we work together on this, it’s essential to recognize each step you take towards overcoming your fears. How are you feeling about beginning this process?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but I’m still anxious about how it will go.

Consultant: Hope is a wonderful starting point! Let’s remember that it’s okay to feel anxious. That doesn’t have to stop you from trying—just like before, every small step counts. Do you have any situations coming up where you can practice this new approach?

User: We have a group project starting next week. I could try to speak up then.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great opportunity. As we get closer to that day, let’s visualize what that will look like. How do you imagine you’ll feel once you’ve shared your thoughts?

User: I hope I’ll feel proud of myself, even if I’m nervous.

Consultant: Feeling proud of yourself is an excellent goal! It reinforces the effort you’re putting in. Just remember, it’s normal to feel nervous, and that doesn’t take away from your accomplishment. We can also practice some calming techniques for those moments you feel anxious. Would you like to explore that?

User: Yes, that would help, especially if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Let’s start by focusing on your breathing. Taking slow, deep breaths can really help calm your mind. Can we try a breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for four counts... and hold for four counts… and exhale for four counts. Let’s do that a few times. How do you feel after the exercise?

User: I feel a little more relaxed. I think I can use that when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This technique can be a valuable tool for you. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You've identified some of the negative thoughts holding you back, and we’ve also explored some positive alternatives and practical steps to tackle your anxiety. How do you feel about everything we talked about today?

User: I feel like I have some tools to work with and I’m more aware of my thoughts now. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! Remember, it’s all about progress. You’re building a foundation for self-acceptance and growth. In our next session, we can discuss how the group project went and explore any feelings or feedback you have. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open to this process. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Take care until our next meeting!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I think I feel a little bit better about myself, but I still struggle with confidence. After that misunderstanding with my classmates during the group activity, I feel even more isolated now.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the situation with your classmates had a significant impact on you. Can you share more about what happened and how it made you feel?

User: Well, during the activity, I accidentally said something that seemed to upset a few of them. They looked at me differently afterward, and I felt embarrassed. Now I avoid them even more because I think they'll judge me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, and it's understandable to feel anxious after experiencing that. You mentioned that you feel judged—what thoughts were going through your mind in that moment?

User: I thought that maybe they all see me as awkward or someone they don't want to be around. It just makes me want to hide even more.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would lead to wanting to retreat. However, let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think there might be another way to interpret their reactions besides feeling judged?

User: I guess they might not care as much as I think they do. But it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not fitting in.

Consultant: That's an important realization. Sometimes our minds can amplify negative perceptions. What if we try to challenge the idea that you don't fit in? Can you think of moments when you felt included or accepted by your peers?

User: There were times when I felt like part of the group, but they seem so distant now. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: I understand. Those feelings of distance can be tough. What if we set a small goal for you to reconnect with them? Something that feels manageable?

User: Maybe I could say hi to one of them next week? But it feels very daunting.

Consultant: That's a great start! It might seem daunting, but it's a positive step forward. How about we come up with a plan on how you would approach that situation?

User: I could try to greet them when I see them in the hall. Just a quick “hi” should be easy enough.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s just a simple hello. It’s also okay to remind yourself that their reactions do not define your worth. What do you think you might say to yourself before approaching them?

User: I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay. But I still worry they’ll think less of me.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that worry. However, focusing on your own feelings of self-worth can help you feel more confident. Would you like to practice some affirmations or positive statements we could use together?

User: That might help. What kind of affirmations do you think I should say?

Consultant: How about something like, “I am worthy of making connections,” or “People can see the real me beyond my mistakes”? These can serve as reminders of your value.

User: I like those. I’ll try to remember them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear. It’s also important to recognize the progress you’re making, however small. Looking ahead, how do you feel about making these small steps part of your routine?

User: It seems like a manageable approach, but I still feel like I might fail at it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Remember, the goal isn't perfection but progress. If things don't go as planned, it’s not a failure; it’s a learning experience. How does that reframe your worry?

User: I guess it makes it feel less heavy. It’s better to think of it as practice. 

Consultant: Absolutely. You’re practicing building your confidence and stepping outside your comfort zone. To recap our session, we discussed the importance of challenging negative thoughts, setting small goals, and using affirmations. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. I like that idea of small steps.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have! As we conclude today, what strategies do you feel you can utilize to continue this progress next week?

User: I think I can focus on my affirmations and just try saying hi to someone. 

Consultant: Perfect! Those are actionable steps. Keep practicing, and remember that you’re not alone in this. I'm here to support you. If you find yourself struggling again, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. I'll do my best.

Consultant: You're welcome! I believe in your ability to make these changes. Looking forward to our next session, and remember, take it one step at a time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to cope with the feelings of embarrassment after what happened in class. I still feel anxious about talking in front of others.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience really affected you. Let's explore what you're feeling right now. Can you share more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about that incident?

User: I keep thinking that everyone thinks I'm stupid for trying to answer. It makes me not want to participate in class anymore.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You feel like others are judging you, which is contributing to your anxiety. When you think about that judgment, how does it make you feel?

User: I feel really inadequate and embarrassed. Sometimes, I even question if I should just stay quiet.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you sense judgment. Let's take a moment to challenge that thinking. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that everyone thinks negatively of you?

User: I don't know… I just felt their laughter, and it seemed like they were laughing at me. 

Consultant: It’s natural to interpret laughter as negative, but sometimes laughter can have different meanings. Is it possible that they were laughing for reasons unrelated to you?

User: Maybe. But I still can’t help feeling it was directed at me.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. How about thinking of a friend in that situation? What would you tell them if they felt the same way you do now?

User: I’d tell them not to take it personally and that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Can you remind yourself of that advice when you start to feel judged? It might help you shift your focus from how others see you to how you see yourself.

User: That makes sense. I really want to be more confident. 

Consultant: Confidence is absolutely something we can work on together! Let’s think about small steps you can take to get involved in class. What’s one thing you would feel comfortable trying first?

User: I could maybe try to answer questions that I feel more sure about.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with questions you feel confident about can help build your self-esteem. How can you make sure you remember to do that next time?

User: I could write a note to myself to focus on my strengths.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Focusing on your strengths can help shift your perspective. Also, how about practicing some positive affirmations? Affirming your value can reinforce your confidence. 

User: I haven’t thought much about that. What would I say?

Consultant: You could say things like, "I have valuable contributions," or "It’s okay to make mistakes, and I learn from them." How do you think that might feel?

User: I guess it would feel good to remind myself like that.

Consultant: Absolutely. It seems like a good practice to carry with you. Also, how have you been feeling about social interactions outside of class?  

User: I’m still a bit afraid to join groups, but I want to feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That’s understandable! Maybe we can explore some activities that interest you, which could connect you with new people in a more relaxed environment. What kinds of activities do you enjoy?

User: I like drawing and reading. I think there could be art clubs or book clubs.

Consultant: Those are wonderful options! Joining clubs can help you meet people with similar interests, which may ease your social anxiety. Would you consider checking out a local art or book club?

User: I think I could try that. It sounds fun!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Engaging in activities you love is a great way to boost your confidence and enjoy social interactions. How can we ensure that you take this next step?

User: I could look up clubs online this week and see what fits my schedule.

Consultant: Perfect! Setting a specific plan can help keep you accountable. When you share your interests, you may find that others appreciate your contributions. 

User: I really want to believe that. 

Consultant: It's definitely possible. Remember, celebrating small wins can also boost your self-esteem. How would it feel to congratulate yourself for trying out those clubs?

User: It would feel great! I think I’ll try to be proud of each small step I take.

Consultant: That's a valuable mindset! Gradually building confidence will make such a difference. As we wrap up today, what have been your biggest takeaways from our conversation?

User: I feel like I can work on my self-talk and challenge those negative thoughts better. I need to focus more on my strengths.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, you’re capable of more than you think. Keep practicing those strategies, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more confident. I look forward to applying all this!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep believing in yourself, and remember to enjoy the process!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you've come for another session. It sounds like you've made some significant progress in your social interactions. How are you feeling about your recent experiences?

User: Hi! I feel a bit more confident after participating in that school activity. Seeing others appreciate my involvement was really encouraging. But I still want to know how I can maintain this confidence in social situations.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you felt appreciated! It’s a great step forward. Let’s explore together how you can continue to build on this confidence. Can you share more about the moments in that activity when you felt good about yourself?

User: Sure! During the activity, I engaged in discussions with my classmates, and they seemed to value my input. It was nice to feel included, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed talking with them.

Consultant: It sounds like you had some positive interactions that made you feel included and valued. How did those moments shift your feelings about participating in future activities?

User: I think it made me realize that I can contribute and that people appreciate what I have to say. I want to keep experiencing that feeling, but I'm not sure how to ensure it happens again.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Enjoying those interactions is important. One strategy we can use is to keep a positive record of your social experiences. Would you be comfortable reflecting on these moments regularly to reinforce those feelings of confidence?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I often forget about the good things that happen, so writing it down might help me remember.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping a record can help you see the progress you’re making and remind you of your strengths. For example, after an event, you could jot down what went well and how it felt. What do you think your first entry might look like?

User: I could write about how I spoke up during the discussions and how I felt happy when my classmates responded positively. It's nice to think about it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! By focusing on those uplifting moments, you're reinforcing the idea that you can enjoy interactions. As we progress, let’s also think about setting small social goals. How about trying to engage in a new social activity each week? 

User: That sounds manageable. I would like to try some new clubs or group activities at school.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Exploring new social settings can also introduce you to a variety of experiences. What type of clubs or activities are you interested in?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining the art club. I like drawing, and it could be a fun way to meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: Joining the art club sounds like an excellent idea! It combines your interests with the opportunity to connect with others. How do you feel about stepping into this new environment?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I'm also excited. I just hope I don’t freeze up when I meet new people there.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about meeting new people, but remember, the more you put yourself in these situations, the easier it will become. Let’s think about some strategies to help manage that anxiety. What might help you feel more at ease before you go into the art club?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that everyone is there to have fun, just like me. That might help me relax.

Consultant: Absolutely! Framing it as a fun experience and reminding yourself of that shared goal can be very calming. How about also preparing a few open-ended questions or comments about art to help kick off conversations when you feel shy?

User: That’s a great idea! I think having something to say would definitely help.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Preparing a few conversation starters can take the pressure off you. You’ll feel more equipped to express yourself. How do you feel about these preparations?

User: I feel more confident knowing I have a plan. I think I can handle it better now.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! You’re taking proactive steps to manage your anxiety, and that’s a huge part of building your confidence in social settings. Can you share how you plan to remind yourself of these tools while you’re at the club?

User: I’ll try to carry a small note with my thoughts and questions. That way, I can look at it if I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Having that reminder can ground you in the moment. As you continue to engage socially, let’s also celebrate your efforts, no matter how small. What small wins can we celebrate from your experiences so far?

User: I think just participating in the recent event is a win in itself. I tackled my fears about joining and talking with others.

Consultant: Absolutely, every step counts! You’ve taken strides towards overcoming your fears, and that’s something to be proud of. How do you envision celebrating these small victories moving forward?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with something small, like treating myself to a snack or spending some time drawing.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to celebrate your achievements! It reinforces positive behavior while making you feel good about your progress. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the conversation and the goals we’ve set?

User: I feel really positive! I have a better understanding of how to maintain my confidence and approach new social situations. I’m excited to start.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It’s inspiring to see your enthusiasm. Remember, every social experience you engage in is a building block for your confidence. Before we conclude, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or explore?

User: No, I think we covered everything important. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been great talking with you today. Keep embracing those social opportunities, and remember to record your positive experiences. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you here today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel really good. I had a great experience leading my group in the club activities. It was exciting to work with others and feel their support. I want to keep building on that!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you enjoyed the experience and felt supported. Let’s explore how we can maintain that positivity and boost your social skills further. What aspects of teamwork did you find most enjoyable?

User: I liked how we communicated and shared ideas. It felt nice to contribute and feel valued by my peers. I really want to keep that energy going in future group activities.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you experienced that sense of contribution and value. Let's focus on how you can carry that positive energy into future collaborations. What thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about participating in another group?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous too. I want to be a good leader again, but I worry about making mistakes or not being accepted by the group.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both excited and a little anxious about potential mistakes. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. What specifically do you think might happen if you make a mistake in a group setting?

User: I guess I'm afraid that they'll judge me or that I'll let the team down. It’s just a worry I have.

Consultant: That fear of judgment is something many people experience. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of a time when someone from your group made a mistake? How did the rest of the team react?

User: Yes, one of my team members forgot to bring an important document, but we just worked around it. Everyone understood and helped out.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like your team was supportive and able to adapt. That shows that mistakes can often be resolved with teamwork and understanding. How does that perspective change the way you view your own potential mistakes?

User: I guess it makes me feel like it’s not the end of the world if I slip up. I see that we can work together to fix things.

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to look at it! Embracing a mindset of collaboration can help reduce the fear of making mistakes. What strategies can you use to remind yourself of this when you're feeling anxious in a group setting?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect and that we’re all there to support each other. I could also focus on what I enjoy about working with the team.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Focusing on support and enjoyment can help shift your mindset. Let’s practice some social skills that could enhance your leadership in teamwork. How about role-playing a scenario where you might need to lead a discussion?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful! I could try being in charge of a project discussion with my team.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine you're leading that discussion. Start off by introducing the topic, and I’ll play one of your team members. Go ahead!

User: Okay, everyone! I’m glad to see you all here. I want to discuss our project ideas and get your thoughts on what direction we should take.

Consultant: Thanks for starting us off! I’m excited about the project too. What are some ideas you have in mind?

User: I think we could brainstorm a few concepts, and then maybe vote on our favorite ideas to move forward with.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! It encourages participation from everyone. How do you feel in this role?

User: I feel more confident as I see that everyone is engaged. I think I can lead this way!

Consultant: You’re doing wonderfully! That confidence can really shine through in a group. Practicing these skills will help cement that feeling. What else do you think you might want to practice or improve in your leadership role?

User: I guess I want to work on giving feedback effectively. Sometimes I’m unsure how to do it without hurting someone’s feelings.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern as well. Providing constructive feedback is key in any teamwork setting. What do you think might be a balanced way to offer feedback that encourages improvement while also being kind?

User: Maybe I could start with something positive before mentioning areas to improve. That way, it feels more supportive.

Consultant: Definitely! Starting with positive reinforcement helps create a safe space for feedback. You’re learning how to balance honesty with empathy. How do you feel about implementing these skills in real situations?

User: I feel more prepared now! I think I can use these techniques to handle feedback better.

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s amazing to see your progress. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you can apply it in the future.

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to make mistakes and that teamwork is about supporting each other. I feel ready to lead discussions and give constructive feedback.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great strides in developing your leadership skills and confidence. Remember these strategies, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more support. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more positive about my social interactions now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep embracing your growth, and I look forward to seeing how you continue to thrive in your social settings!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really pleased to see you today. You've made remarkable progress, and I'd love to hear how you've been feeling since we last spoke. What positive changes have you noticed in yourself?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident lately. Participating in that mental health project made me reflect on my own experiences, and I really embraced the idea of helping others. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're really connecting with your own journey and wanting to share that with others. Can you tell me more about specific moments or experiences that have helped you feel this way?

User: Sure! When I shared my story during the project, I felt like I was able to connect with my classmates. They seemed to appreciate my openness, and it made me feel that I can really contribute to their well-being.

Consultant: Connecting with your classmates in that way is very powerful. It not only helps them but also reinforces your own self-worth. What do you think you’ve learned about yourself through this experience?

User: I learned that I can express my feelings without being afraid. Also, I realized that my experiences could help others, which makes me feel valuable.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! Recognizing your value and the impact you can have on others is important. How do you feel about your ability to continue these efforts in the future?

User: I feel motivated! I want to continue helping others and also keep enhancing my own skills. But sometimes, I worry about being able to maintain this momentum.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those worries, especially when you’re aiming for growth. Let's talk about some strategies you can use to sustain that motivation. Have you considered setting specific goals for yourself?

User: I haven’t really thought about specific goals. I just feel like I need to keep moving forward and see where it leads. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! However, setting specific, achievable goals can provide direction and help keep you accountable. What do you think are some areas you'd like to focus on?

User: I think I’d like to improve my communication skills and maybe learn more about mental health topics so I can support others better.

Consultant: Those are excellent areas to focus on! Improving communication skills can help you express yourself even more effectively, and learning more about mental health can enhance your support for others. How about we brainstorm some specific steps you can take in these areas?

User: That sounds good! I’d be interested in attending workshops on communication and reading books or articles about mental health.

Consultant: Great ideas! Attending workshops can provide hands-on practice, while reading can expand your knowledge. How about setting a timeline for these goals? For example, you could aim to attend one workshop in the next month and read a book over the next few weeks.

User: Yeah, I like that plan! I can definitely commit to that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! It sounds like you’re ready to take action. As we discuss this, how are you feeling about your ability to put these plans into motion?

User: I feel really excited! It’s nice to have a clear path ahead. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's essential to feel excited about your future. As we wrap up today's session, let's reflect on what you’ve accomplished so far and how these plans can reinforce your self-efficacy moving forward. What do you think has been your most significant change?

User: I think understanding my value and realizing I can help others has been the most significant change for me. 

Consultant: That's a powerful realization. Remember, acknowledging your strengths is key to maintaining your confidence. How can you continue to reinforce this understanding in your everyday life?

User: I can remind myself of my achievements and keep reflecting on my experiences, just like I did during the project.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your achievements is a wonderful way to sustain your self-esteem. Lastly, as you think about the future, what kind of long-term support do you think might help you continue on this positive path?

User: I think continuing to talk with someone about my thoughts and experiences would be really helpful. Maybe regular check-ins could keep me on track.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Consistent check-ins can provide the support and accountability you’re seeking. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and you can always seek help when needed. How do you feel about wrapping up our conversation today?

User: I feel prepared and optimistic! Thank you for helping me clarify my thoughts and goals.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure to work with you today! I believe you have the tools you need to thrive. Remember to celebrate your progress and don't hesitate to reconnect whenever you feel the need. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to applying what we talked about. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I wish you all the best on your journey ahead. 

User: Bye! 

Consultant: Goodbye!
