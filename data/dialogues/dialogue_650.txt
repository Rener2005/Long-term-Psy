Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite lonely. I still struggle to connect with my dorm mates, and it makes me feel like I don’t belong anywhere.

Consultant: I can understand how isolating that must feel. It’s tough to be in an environment where you feel disconnected from others. Can you share a bit more about your experiences with your dorm mates?

User: Well, I’ve tried talking to them, but the conversations feel forced. They often seem busy or uninterested. I end up feeling like I’m intruding.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It’s understandable to feel like you’re intruding when the response is not warm. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to your mind during these interactions?

User: Yes, I often think that they don’t like me or that I'm just annoying them. Sometimes, I even think it would be better if I just keep to myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful. It's important to acknowledge them. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel anxious and really self-conscious. I start worrying even more about what to say or do.

Consultant: It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety for you. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. Is there any evidence that suggests your dorm mates don’t want to interact with you?

User: I suppose they sometimes seem preoccupied, but I can’t say for sure that they don’t want to talk to me. I might just be interpreting their behavior in a negative way.

Consultant: You’re recognizing an important point there. Sometimes, we project our feelings of insecurity onto others. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it some time and not to take things too personally.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s fundamental to remember that your feelings may not reflect the complete reality of the situation. How can this thought be applied to your current feelings?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that it’s not all about me. Maybe they are just busy with their own lives, and that’s okay.

Consultant: Exactly! It's a healthy thought to carry with you. Let’s focus on some positive actions you could take that align with this new perspective. What could you do to engage more with your dorm mates in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could invite them for a movie night or something casual like that. It might make it easier to connect without so much pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! It creates a relaxed environment for everyone. How would you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. I think it could be fun to try.

Consultant: Nerves are completely normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. What’s one small step you can take today to prepare for this invitation?

User: I could create a quick plan for the movie night and think about what kind of snacks to have. It might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Great! Planning can definitely make you feel more prepared and at ease. How do you feel about your self-confidence in approaching this new situation?

User: I still feel unsure, but this seems like a good way to take a small step. I don’t want to feel so lonely anymore.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. You're taking action, which is an important part of fostering connections. How can we build on this confidence in our next sessions?

User: Maybe we can talk more about how I can handle any negative thoughts that come up when approaching them.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll focus on techniques to manage those thoughts and reinforce your confidence. As a next step, can you commit to creating that plan for the movie night by the end of the week?

User: Yes, I can do that. I really want to push myself to connect with them.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking this initiative, Liu! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thanks for your support. I appreciate it a lot.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in you and can’t wait to hear about your experiences. We’ll keep working together to navigate this journey. 

User: Yes, I really hope I can make some connections. It feels encouraging to discuss this with you.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, building relationships takes time and patience. You’re taking important steps. 

User: Thank you. I’ll work on my plan and see how it goes.

Consultant: Sounds like a plan, Liu! I look forward to our next session. Take care until then. 

User: I will, thanks! See you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you here today. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling a bit lost. I joined some campus activities to meet people, but I still feel like I don’t belong. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling disconnected in a new setting can be tough. Can you share more about what happened during these activities that made you feel this way?

User: Well, I try to engage with others, but when I speak, it seems like they don't really listen or care. It makes me question if I’m interesting enough to be part of the group.

Consultant: That sounds quite disheartening. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of self-doubt when interacting with others. What thoughts are running through your mind in those moments?

User: I think things like, “They’ll never want to hang out with me” or “I’m just awkward.” These thoughts make me feel even more withdrawn.

Consultant: It’s understandable those thoughts would lead to feeling isolated. Let's explore those ideas. Do you think there’s evidence to support them, or is there another way to look at those interactions?

User: I guess I don't really have strong proof. It’s just what I believe in that moment. But it feels so real!

Consultant: Emotions can definitely feel overpowering. If a friend shared similar thoughts with you, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel that way and they are worth listening to. They might not be as awkward as they think.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. So, what if we tried applying that same understanding to your feelings? How does it change how you view yourself in these situations?

User: I guess it makes me realize that maybe I'm not as unlikable as I think. Maybe I just need to give myself a break.

Consultant: Absolutely! Giving yourself grace is important. What do you think could happen if you approached social situations with that gentler mindset?

User: I think I might be able to relax a bit and maybe even enjoy myself. But what if I still feel awkward?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. But remember, everyone feels awkward sometimes. How about we think of some small steps for you to take? Perhaps initiating a brief conversation with someone you find interesting?

User: That sounds manageable. I could try saying hello to someone. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! What do you think might happen if that conversation goes well? 

User: Maybe I’d feel more connected and less lonely... that sounds nice.

Consultant: It does sound nice! And what about the times it doesn't go as planned? How could you handle that?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's just one interaction and not everyone will always connect. 

Consultant: Great insight! Keeping things in perspective can help reduce the pressure. How do you feel about trying out your plan for the next week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I’m willing to give it a try. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous! Remember, taking that first step is what matters. Can we agree to discuss how it went when we meet next?

User: Yes, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let's reflect. What do you feel is the biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it's that I need to be kinder to myself and try to challenge my negative thoughts about socializing.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Liu. You’re making progress. Remember, it might take time, but every small step counts! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m here for you, and I look forward to our next session to hear about your experiences. Take care until then! 

User: You too!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Liu. I know we've talked before about your feelings regarding your family. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I still feel quite distant from my mom. Our conversation didn’t really help. I still feel abandoned, especially since she remarried. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pain regarding your relationship with your mom and her remarriage. Can you tell me more about what you felt during your conversation with her?

User: I tried to express how I felt, but it was like she didn't understand. I ended up feeling more lonely and unheard, which is frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that would feel incredibly frustrating. It's like your efforts to reach out didn’t have the impact you hoped for. What specific things did you tell her about your feelings?

User: I told her that I feel like I don't matter to her anymore. But she just said it’s not true and that she loves me, which makes me feel even more confused.

Consultant: It sounds like her response didn’t validate your feelings, which can make you doubt yourself. Can you think of any thoughts you had in that moment that might have contributed to feeling abandoned?

User: I kept thinking that if she loved me, she would spend more time with me. It's like I’m not a priority anymore.

Consultant: That’s a significant thought, and it’s understandable to feel that way. However, let's explore this thought a bit further. What evidence do you have that you aren’t a priority to her?

User: Well, she’s busy with her new life and seems happier without me around. I guess that makes me feel like I don’t matter much to her.

Consultant: It sounds like you've drawn a conclusion based on her actions. But is it possible that she’s just trying to adjust to her new life and not about her feelings for you? 

User: Maybe. But it still hurts to think that I might not be important to her anymore.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel hurt by that. Let’s challenge that thought a little more. If a friend told you they felt abandoned because their parent was busy, what might you say to comfort them?

User: I would probably tell them that their parent still loves them and that sometimes people get caught up in their lives.

Consultant: Exactly! You have insight into what others might feel, but it's tougher when it’s about you. What would it look like if you treated yourself with that same kind of compassion?

User: I guess I could remind myself that love doesn't necessarily mean constant presence. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Liu. Let’s think about how you could communicate this understanding to your mom. What if you shared your feelings more openly and asked her about hers?

User: I’d like to try that, but I’m afraid it won't change anything. 

Consultant: It’s brave of you to consider opening up despite your fears. How would it feel to take that small step and express your desire to connect more deeply with her?

User: It feels scary but also a little hopeful. Maybe if I convey how much I want to reconnect, she’ll try harder too.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective! By communicating your desire for a stronger relationship, you create the opportunity for change. What specific things would you like to share with your mom?

User: I’d want to tell her how much I miss her and that I wish we could spend more time together. 

Consultant: That's a heartfelt message. You might consider asking her if she has time to meet or talk more regularly. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds reasonable. I think I can handle that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Think about how you will feel after expressing those thoughts. It could not only enhance your relationship with her but also strengthen your emotional resilience.

User: Yes. It feels empowering to think about taking that step. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It’s clear that you are beginning to acknowledge the sources of your feelings and are ready to take action. What’s next for you in this journey?

User: I want to create a plan for how to approach the conversation and also work on not letting my fears hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Let’s take it one step at a time. How about we set small goals for you to prepare for that conversation?

User: Yes, I can start by writing down what I want to say and practicing it a bit.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Practicing can help ease your anxiety for the actual conversation. How do you feel about this approach? 

User: I feel more confident about it now. 

Consultant: Wonderful. Remember, this process takes time, and it’s okay to feel a range of emotions. You’re taking meaningful steps towards improving your connection with your mom.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: I’m here for you, Liu. It’s been great to see you reflect on these thoughts today. Stay focused on your goals, and we can continue to build on this in our next session. 

User: I will! Looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Take care, and see you next time! 

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you today. I understand you've been reflecting on your social challenges recently. Let's start by exploring how you've been feeling about that.

User: Hi! Yes, I've been thinking about my social difficulties a lot, especially after the recent tutoring activity. I realized that I've avoided social situations for a long time, and I want to understand why I feel this way.

Consultant: I appreciate your openness, Liu. It seems like you're beginning to recognize the reasons behind your social discomfort, and that's a significant step. Can you share more about those moments when you felt anxious or avoided social situations?

User: Well, I often feel really nervous in group settings, like I don't know what to say or how to act. I worry that people might judge me, which makes me want to just stay quiet or leave.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fear around judgement in social interactions. That can be really tough. What thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: I often think that no one will find what I say interesting, or that they will think I’m awkward. Sometimes I even imagine them laughing at me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly distressing, and they sound like they might be contributing to the anxiety you feel. Let's take a closer look at those beliefs. When you think people might laugh at you, how certain do you feel about that outcome?

User: I guess I'm not entirely sure, but my anxiety tells me it’s a strong possibility. It's like my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you're anxious. It might help to consider that your mind is reacting based on fear rather than evidence. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts a bit? Can you think of times when you shared something in a group and it went well?

User: Well, there have been a few times when people seemed to actually enjoy what I said. I remember once during a class discussion, a classmate even complimented my idea.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like there are instances where your contributions were well-received. Could you use that experience to help counter the thought that people will always judge you negatively?

User: Yes, I can see how that example shows I can contribute positively. I suppose not every situation will go badly.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing those positive experiences is essential. Now, let's think about some practical steps you can take to gradually face those social situations. What activities or settings feel more approachable to you?

User: Maybe joining a club at school? It feels less intimidating than speaking up in class.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! It provides a structured way to meet new people and practice social skills in a more relaxed environment. What type of club are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about joining the art club. I enjoy drawing, and it might help me connect with others who have similar interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect fit! Engaging in something you enjoy can often make it easier to interact with others. How do you feel about challenging yourself to attend a meeting soon?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. I know it’s a step I need to take.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous, but excitement is a great sign! Let's also talk about how you can prepare for that meeting. What strategies can you think of to help calm your nerves beforehand?

User: Maybe I could practice some conversation starters or remind myself that it’s okay to be myself?

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing can help lessen the anxiety, and reminding yourself that it's okay to be genuine will build your confidence. How about setting a goal for yourself regarding this first meeting?

User: I could aim to say at least one thing during the meeting and maybe try to connect with someone afterwards.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal! It’s important to celebrate each step forward, no matter how small. As you move towards these interactions, how do you want to treat yourself during this process?

User: I want to be kinder to myself and not be too hard on myself if things don't go perfectly.

Consultant: That's an important mindset to cultivate, Liu. Remember, self-compassion can help in making the process less daunting. Speaking of which, how do you envision yourself feeling after giving these social situations a try?

User: I hope I feel a sense of accomplishment, even if it's just a little. Maybe it will help me feel more confident over time.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful vision! Feeling a sense of achievement can really build your confidence in social settings. Let’s recap what you’ve decided on—joining the art club, preparing conversation starters, and aiming to engage during your first meeting. 

User: Yes, I feel like having this plan makes it seem more manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and each small step counts. As we wrap up today, what are your thoughts on our discussion and your plan moving forward?

User: I feel a bit lighter after talking. I see that there’s hope, even if I still have some doubts about my worth in social situations.

Consultant: It's great that you’re feeling a bit lighter, and it’s perfectly common to have those doubts. As you continue to take steps forward, keep reminding yourself of your value and the positive experiences you’ve had. If you ever find yourself struggling, we can work through it together.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I’m proud of the insights you’ve gained today. I look forward to hearing how it goes at the next session. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more support. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you in today's session. How have you been feeling since our last time together? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lighter, actually. I have hope for my relationships with my peers now, but I still question my own worth sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit lighter and more hopeful about your relationships. Let's explore that a little more. Can you tell me about moments when you felt doubtful about your value?

User: Well, sometimes when I share in the peer support group, I worry that what I say doesn't really matter or that others might not want to hear it.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you fear your contributions might not be valued by others. What emotions do you feel when you have those thoughts?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes a little embarrassed. It makes me hesitant to speak up.

Consultant: Your feelings of anxiety and embarrassment are completely valid. It's challenging to share when we feel uncertain. Let’s try to identify any automatic thoughts that come to mind when you think about speaking up in the group. What thoughts cross your mind?

User: I think things like "They won’t care what I say," or "I’ll just embarrass myself." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. How do you think those beliefs affect your willingness to participate in the group discussions?

User: They definitely hold me back. I end up just listening instead of sharing because I’m afraid of being judged.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts lead to avoiding sharing. Now, let’s challenge those negative beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, and is there any evidence against them?

User: I guess sometimes people actually nod or seem interested when I do share. But my mind quickly dismisses those moments.

Consultant: That's an important realization. You're noticing positive interactions that contradict your thoughts! If a friend expressed those doubts about themselves, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them that they have valuable things to say and that it's okay to be heard.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to see their value. Let’s apply that same kindness to yourself. What would it look like to believe that your contributions are valuable?

User: I think I would feel more confident and willing to share without worrying too much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight. Confidence can come from recognizing your worth. What small step can you take in the next peer support group meeting to practice sharing your thoughts?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing a small thought or a feeling instead of something big, just to get comfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can help build your confidence over time. How do you think you might feel after trying that?

User: I’ll probably feel a bit relieved, and hopefully, it would help me feel like I belong more.

Consultant: Yes! That sense of belonging can be powerful. How about we talk about how you can handle any anxiety that might pop up during the next session?

User: I think I could remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received and try to focus on those moments instead of the negatives.

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive reinforcement can be very effective. Additionally, consider grounding techniques, such as deep breathing, to calm your nerves before sharing. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. Being calm beforehand could really help.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! You deserve to express yourself without worry. Looking ahead, how do you feel about continuing to engage with your peers and building these connections?

User: I feel more optimistic. If I can manage my thoughts, I think I can really connect with others!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic outlook, Liu! Fostering connections can enhance your self-worth and help combat feelings of loneliness. What other goals would you like to explore moving forward?

User: I’d like to keep building my confidence in sharing, and maybe find new ways to interact with my peers outside of the group setting.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Exploring different social activities can certainly enrich your experience. Let's outline some potential activities together. 

User: Sure! Maybe I could join a study group or a club that interests me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging in activities that align with your interests will provide a natural way to connect with others. How can we turn these ideas into actionable steps?

User: I think I could research clubs at my school this week and see which ones sound good to me.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Researching will give you options to consider. Let’s check in next session to see how that goes. What have you learned about yourself today? 

User: I’ve learned that I really can challenge my negative thoughts and that I have more to share than I give myself credit for.

Consultant: That’s a significant takeaway! Recognizing your worth and the value of your voice is key to your progress. Keep reflecting on this before our next meeting. How do you feel about wrapping up for today?

User: I feel good! I’m leaving with some actionable steps and a better mindset.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about small steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, Liu!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again for our session. I’m excited to hear about how you’ve been since our last meeting. How are you feeling these days?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good lately. I’ve been getting along well with my dorm mates and even participated in some group activities. It feels nice to connect with others.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re really making progress in your social interactions. Can you tell me more about these group activities and how they made you feel?

User: Sure! We had a movie night, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I felt really included, and it was nice to laugh and talk with everyone. I even found myself making jokes, which is something I used to struggle with.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a great time and felt a sense of belonging. Making jokes is a fantastic way to bond with others. What did you take away from those experiences? 

User: I realized that I can be more relaxed and enjoy myself around others. I think I’ve built some confidence in social situations. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Your confidence is clearly growing. However, what about times when you might feel less confident? Are there specific situations where you still feel uneasy?

User: Sometimes, I worry about meeting new people. I still feel a little anxious when I’m in unfamiliar social settings, like gatherings with people I don’t know well.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious in those situations. Let’s explore that together. Can you recall a specific recent experience that made you feel anxious about meeting new people?

User: Yes, just last week, I attended a party that I was invited to by one of my dorm mates. I felt nervous because I didn’t know many people there.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. What thoughts came to your mind in the moment that contributed to your anxiety?

User: I kept thinking that I might embarrass myself or not fit in, and those thoughts made me even more nervous.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely amplify anxiety. Now, let’s look at those beliefs more closely. Do you think there's any evidence supporting the idea that you might embarrass yourself or not fit in?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. Last time, I ended up talking to a couple of people and had fun.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like your experiences have shown you that you can fit in and enjoy yourself. What if you were to replace those anxious thoughts with more encouraging ones, like reminding yourself of the fun you had? 

User: That makes sense. I could tell myself I’ve successfully connected with people before and can do it again.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Establishing a more supportive inner dialogue can really help manage your anxiety. How do you feel about practicing that during your next social event? 

User: I’d like to try that! I feel more optimistic thinking about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also discuss some techniques to help you feel more comfortable before and during social events. Are there any relaxation methods you know of that could help ease your anxiety?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing exercises but haven’t really tried them out yet.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be incredibly helpful. It activates your body's relaxation response. Would you like to practice that together briefly?

User: Yes, that sounds good!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts… hold for four… and now exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts. How did that feel?

User: That was actually calming. I think I could use that before going to a party.

Consultant: Great! Incorporating breathing exercises can help ground you before diving into social situations. As you continue to connect with others, what might be a goal you’d like to set for yourself regarding your social interactions?

User: I want to make an effort to introduce myself to at least two new people at the next gathering I attend.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It’s specific and achievable. Remember to practice your supportive self-talk as you approach new people. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels manageable. I’m excited to challenge myself!

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! Let’s take a moment to recap what we’ve discussed today about your progress and strategies moving forward. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I’ve improved in social settings, and I can continue to build on that by changing my thought patterns and practicing breathing techniques.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great strides and have a solid plan to enhance your social experiences. As we look ahead, what might help you maintain your progress? 

User: I can keep using the strategies we talked about and remind myself of my successes. I’ll also stay engaged with my dorm mates.

Consultant: Those are excellent points! It’s all about consistency. As we wrap up today’s session, I want to encourage you to keep embracing these social opportunities. You’re on a positive path, and I believe in your ability to navigate these situations.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support, and I feel much more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu. Remember, it’s been a pleasure seeing your growth. If you feel any challenges coming up in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing about your successes next time!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep in touch. Take care!

Consultant: Take care, Liu! See you next time!
