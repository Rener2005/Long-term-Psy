Consultant: Hello, Xiaoq, welcome to today’s session. I’m glad you’re here. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I still feel quite alone. It's hard for me to fit in with my classmates, especially since our lifestyles are so different. I worry about how they see me.

Consultant: I understand. Feeling disconnected can be really challenging, especially in a new environment like college. Can you tell me more about what aspects make you feel different from your classmates?

User: Well, my eating habits are different, and I don't feel comfortable participating in group activities. I end up avoiding situations where I have to interact with them.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re concerned about being judged by others because of these differences. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining in those activities?

User: I often think they won’t accept me or that they'll see me as weird. Sometimes I feel like I don't even belong there.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to really weigh heavily on you. Let’s explore them a bit. When you think about not belonging, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel sad and anxious. I just want to be liked, but I don't know how to connect with them.

Consultant: That desire to connect is completely understandable. Let’s try to identify some automatic thoughts that might be making you anxious. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt these thoughts strongly?

User: Last week, we were supposed to go out for lunch together, but I didn’t go because I thought they wouldn’t want me there.

Consultant: It sounds like you avoided going because of those thoughts about not being wanted. What emotions did you experience when you chose to stay back instead?

User: I felt relief at first, but then I regretted not going. I just felt more isolated afterward.

Consultant: It seems like avoiding the situation initially felt safe, but ultimately left you feeling more lonely. If we take a moment to challenge those thoughts, what evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want you there?

User: I guess I don't really have any solid evidence. I just assumed it wouldn’t go well, based on past experiences.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to jump to negative conclusions without full evidence. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them about joining in?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it a shot and not overthink it. They might actually enjoy it.

Consultant: That's a great perspective to have! Now, let’s consider applying that same advice to yourself. What would it look like for you to take that step and join in next time?

User: Maybe I should at least try to go and talk to them, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that first step can be a bit daunting, but it’s a positive move. What if we made a plan together? How about setting a small goal for the next opportunity?

User: Okay, maybe I could just say hi to one person instead of focusing on the whole group.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! A small interaction can make a difference. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. It’s just the thought of being judged that holds me back.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially with new experiences. Let’s also explore this fear of judgment. What specifically do you worry will happen if you do say hi?

User: I worry they’ll judge me for being awkward or that I’ll mess up the conversation.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear awkwardness, but remember everyone has those moments. What might happen if they actually responded positively to your greeting?

User: I guess that would feel nice. It might even give me a little confidence.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the potential positive outcome can be a great motivator. Let’s also think about how to handle it if things don’t go as planned. What could you tell yourself in that situation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel awkward sometimes and that I can always try again later.

Consultant: That’s a constructive way to think about it! Being kind to yourself in those moments will help ease some of that pressure. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember as you approach this next opportunity?

User: I think I want to remember that it’s okay to take things slowly and not to assume the worst.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Xiaoq. Taking it slowly and challenging those assumptions will help you build connections over time. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You’re making great progress!

Consultant: Hello, Little Q! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling some anxiety related to your social interactions. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've been feeling really anxious about my interactions with my roommate. We don't seem to have much in common, and it makes me feel isolated. Sometimes I want to reach out, but I just end up thinking it's not worth it.

Consultant: I see. It's tough when you feel like you don't have much to connect with someone. You mentioned feeling isolated; can you describe what that feels like for you in your daily life?

User: It just feels lonely, you know? I see my roommate hanging out with others, and I feel like I’m missing out. It's like I don’t belong, and I worry that people see me as awkward or different.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It must be difficult to feel that way. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you say you worry about being seen as awkward, what thoughts come to your mind in those moments?

User: I often think things like, “They probably think I’m weird for not joining in,” or “I’ll embarrass myself if I try to talk.” It just makes me want to hide.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound tough and quite critical. It seems like they're really impacting how you view yourself in social situations. Have you noticed how these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: Yes, they just make me feel more anxious and low. Sometimes, I feel like I can’t even speak or make eye contact.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like there’s a cycle of negative thinking that’s contributing to your anxiety. Would it be okay if we try to challenge some of these thoughts together?

User: Yeah, I think that might help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take one of those thoughts, maybe the idea that you'll embarrass yourself if you try to talk. On a scale of 0 to 10, how much do you believe that thought?

User: I’d say around 8, maybe even 9. 

Consultant: That’s a strong belief. Now, could we look for evidence to support or contradict that thought? Have there been times when you've spoken to people without feeling embarrassed?

User: Well, there were a couple of times in class when I answered questions. I didn't feel embarrassed then, but I was also prepared.

Consultant: That's a great example! You were able to engage without feeling embarrassed when you felt prepared. What do you think would happen if you took small steps to engage with your roommate similarly, even if it’s just a casual conversation?

User: Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad? But I still feel like I wouldn’t know what to say.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let's brainstorm a few simple conversation starters you could use when you feel ready. How about asking her about her classes or interests?

User: That could work. I know she likes one of the same TV shows I do, so maybe I could start there.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opening! Sharing an interest could help ease the pressure. How would it feel to think about approaching her with that topic in mind?

User: It feels a little less scary to think about it that way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. Each small interaction can help you gradually feel more comfortable. How about we set a small goal for you to try this week?

User: Maybe I could try talking to her about the TV show this weekend? 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! When you think about having that conversation, what sort of feelings do you expect to have before and after it?

User: I think I might be nervous beforehand, but maybe I’ll feel proud of myself afterward if I do it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling nervous is perfectly okay, but it’s also important to recognize that pushing through can lead to a sense of accomplishment. How will you celebrate that small step afterward?

User: I guess I could treat myself to my favorite snack or something afterward as a reward.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! It’s all about acknowledging your efforts. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about managing your social interactions moving forward?

User: I still feel a little anxious, but overall, I feel a bit more hopeful about trying. 

Consultant: That’s a significant step! Remember that it's okay to feel anxious. We’ll keep working on this together. Next time, let’s talk about how that conversation went and any feelings that came up. 

User: Okay, I’m looking forward to it. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Q! I'm glad to see you today for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been a bit anxious. I tried to join my class activities, but I worried too much about how I'd perform, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped.

Consultant: I understand that trying to participate in those activities brought up some anxiety for you. Can you share more about the thoughts or feelings you experienced during the event?

User: I kept thinking that everyone would judge me if I made a mistake. I felt like I didn't belong there.

Consultant: It sounds like you were really concerned about how others viewed you. What kind of emotions did those thoughts trigger for you during the activities?

User: I felt nervous and kind of disconnected. It was frustrating because I wanted to have fun, but instead, I just focused on my anxiety.

Consultant: That frustration is completely understandable. It seems like your focus on your anxiety prevented you from enjoying the experience. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in these situations?

User: Maybe if I could just relax and not worry so much about how others see me, I could enjoy it more.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Q! Let’s explore how we can shift your focus away from others' perceptions. Can we try to identify the specific thoughts that arise when you feel anxious in social situations?

User: When I think about talking to people, I worry that I’ll say something silly or that they won't like me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging. You mentioned worrying about saying something silly—how realistic do you think these fears are? Is there evidence that supports those fears?

User: I guess I really don't have any proof that people would judge me like that. It’s just what I think.

Consultant: Exactly. Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to be themselves.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate advice, Q. How might that perspective change how you approach these social events moving forward?

User: I suppose if I could remind myself to be okay with mistakes, I might feel less pressure.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Let's discuss ways to practice reminding yourself of that. Would you be open to trying some relaxation techniques before social events to help ease your anxiety?

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful. What kind of techniques are you thinking?

Consultant: One option is a simple breathing exercise. When you feel anxious, you can take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly. This could help calm your body before engaging socially. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I can definitely try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s make a plan for your next social activity. How might you incorporate the breathing exercise before and during the event?

User: I can practice it a couple of times before I go and remember to do it if I start feeling anxious while I'm there.

Consultant: Perfect! Planning ahead is a key part of reducing anxiety. Now, let’s reflect on the value of the experience itself, not just the performance. How can you remind yourself to focus on enjoyment rather than the outcome?

User: I could set small goals for myself, like just saying hello or joining in conversations without worrying about how well I do.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach, Q! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you focus on the process rather than the pressure of performing. How are you feeling about these strategies?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think if I focus on the fun rather than worrying, I could actually enjoy being with others.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Reflecting on positive experiences can be very powerful. As we wrap up today's session, what’s one thing you plan to do next time you have a social event?

User: I want to try the breathing technique and focus on just enjoying the moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember, practicing these techniques takes time, so be gentle with yourself. You’re making great strides. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. It feels nice to talk about these things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Q! I’m here to support you, and you’re doing great work. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep practicing, and take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hi there, I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello. I’ve been feeling a bit better, especially after attending the group activity at school. It was nice to be around people, but I still feel a bit unsure about interacting with others.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you attended the group activity! It sounds like you’re starting to explore the possibility of connecting with others. Can you share what feelings came up for you during that activity?

User: I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. I enjoyed being with others and felt a sense of support, but I also worried that I might not fit in or say the wrong thing.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that mix of emotions. It sounds like you experienced some positive support, but there’s also that lingering concern about how you might be perceived. Let's explore that a bit. What do you think might help you feel more comfortable in these situations?

User: I think if I could just relax a little more, it would be easier to engage. Sometimes, I overthink what I should say.

Consultant: Overthinking can make it really challenging to enjoy those moments of interaction. What do you usually tell yourself in those moments of anxiety when you're about to speak to someone?

User: I often think things like, "What if they don’t like what I say?" or "I’ll probably embarrass myself." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense and can create a lot of pressure. Let's consider this—how much evidence do you have that these thoughts are true? Have you ever experienced a situation where those fears were proven wrong?

User: Well, there have been times when I spoke up, and people seemed to appreciate my input. But I tend to forget those moments when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you have had positive experiences before! It seems like those moments can get overshadowed by anxiety. What if we could create a strategy to remind you of those successes? 

User: That could be helpful. Maybe writing down my positive experiences would remind me of them when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of these experiences can serve as a positive reinforcement. It’s normal to have moments of doubt, but referencing your accomplishments can help challenge those negative thoughts. Would you be willing to try this?

User: Yes, I’d like to give it a try. 

Consultant: Great! Alongside that, have you thought about setting small, achievable social goals for yourself? For instance, like starting a conversation with one classmate during the week?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could try to speak with one person. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Starting small can build your confidence. After trying it, let’s discuss how it felt during our next session. Remember, each small success is a step toward overcoming that anxiety you feel.

User: I’ll keep that in mind. I hope it works.

Consultant: I believe it can. Alongside this, how have you been feeling about your connections with peers since the group activity? Any changes there?

User: I feel like I want to interact more, but I’m still hesitant. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant. It’s a journey, and you’re taking important steps forward. What could help you feel more prepared or motivated to connect with others?

User: Maybe understanding that it’s okay to not be perfect in those conversations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Everyone has their insecurities, and it’s okay to just be yourself. Remember, genuine interactions often bring the most satisfaction. How about practicing self-compassion? Can you remind yourself it’s okay to be imperfect?

User: That sounds nice. I could try to be kinder to myself during social interactions. 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to approach it. Being kind to yourself can ease pressure and encourage you to engage more freely. What other supportive strategies can you think of that would help you in social settings?

User: Having a friend with me during social events might make it easier. 

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Having someone supportive by your side can help reduce anxiety and provide that comfort. Are there particular events you’d like to invite a friend to?

User: There’s a study group I could attend with a friend. 

Consultant: Perfect! That could provide a context for both social interaction and academic support. Let’s set that as your goal for the week and see how it goes. 

User: I will try to do that! 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up, what takeaways do you have from our session today?

User: I feel more optimistic about trying new social experiences and have some ideas to combat my anxiety. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's been wonderful to see your growth, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. In the meantime, remember to celebrate your small victories.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep nurturing those connections, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today, Q! I’m glad to hear that you received recognition for your suggestions in class. That must have felt really good! How are you feeling about your social skills now?

User: Hi. Yeah, it did feel nice to be acknowledged, but I still have this lingering uncertainty about my social abilities. Sometimes I think, "Was that just a lucky moment?" 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel uncertain, especially after a positive experience. I’d like to explore that thought with you. What do you think makes you doubt your abilities?

User: I guess I worry that people see me as different or strange. I often avoid eye contact, and I don't talk much in groups. It feels safer that way.

Consultant: I understand. Avoiding eye contact and speaking less can sometimes help us feel protected, but it might also hold you back from deeper connections with others. What if we talked about specific moments when you felt successful in social situations? 

User: Sure. In that group discussion, I suggested something, and they actually listened! It was surprising and made me feel more confident momentarily.

Consultant: That sounds like a tremendous experience! It’s important that we celebrate those moments. Can you recall how you felt right after you made your suggestion in the group?

User: I felt a rush of excitement! But then I quickly doubted myself again, thinking, "What if I made a fool of myself?"

Consultant: That back-and-forth between excitement and doubt is quite common. Let's focus on that exciting feeling. How do you think you could reconnect with that confidence the next time you're in a social situation?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that I can contribute, just like that time. But it’s hard when I feel anxious.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re recognizing that pattern. We can work on strategies to help reinforce your positive feelings. For instance, could you identify a mantra or a phrase to tell yourself when starting a conversation?

User: Maybe something like, "I have valuable ideas to share," could work. 

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful affirmation! Would you be open to practicing saying that to yourself before social interactions? 

User: Yeah, I can give it a try. I need to build up that part of me more.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. How about we also explore some small social activities you could engage in to practice those skills? 

User: I could invite a classmate for coffee. It feels less daunting than large groups.

Consultant: Inviting a classmate for a one-on-one could be a great first step! How do you feel when you think about doing that? 

User: A bit nervous, but also excited. I want to just go for it. 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, it's okay to feel nervous. This is a learning journey. Setting small goals like this can gradually strengthen your confidence.  

User: Right, I can take it slow. I like that approach. 

Consultant: Absolutely, taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. After your coffee, how would you like to reflect on that experience? 

User: I could jot down how it went and what I felt. That might help me see my progress. 

Consultant: Great idea! Writing can be a powerful tool for reflection. As you write, notice both any positive exchanges and your feelings before and after. 

User: Got it! This sounds really helpful. 

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! It’s all about building on your successes, however small. How does this path feel to you for your social interactions?

User: It feels more manageable now. I think I can really work on those smaller steps. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Q! Just remember, it's perfectly okay to feel unsure sometimes. What matters is the progress you’re making. 

User: Yes! I’m feeling more optimistic about it now.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! To wrap up today, let’s summarize the strategies we discussed and set a small goal for our next session. What do you think?

User: I want to follow through with inviting that classmate and write about it afterward.

Consultant: Sounds like a perfect goal! When we meet next, we can discuss that experience and how it affected your confidence. 

User: I’m looking forward to it! 

Consultant: Me too, Q! You've shown such commitment today. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths. If any doubts arise, just recall that excitement from your group discussion. 

User: Thanks! That makes me feel hopeful. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, I’m here to support you. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Q! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better with my interactions lately. I recently worked through a small conflict with my roommate, and it felt good to collaborate.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It’s encouraging to hear that you're feeling more confident in your interactions. Could you tell me more about how you approached that situation with your roommate?

User: Well, we had a misunderstanding about sharing chores. I took the initiative to talk about it, and we ended up dividing the tasks more fairly. I felt like my opinion mattered.

Consultant: That's excellent! Taking the initiative shows a lot of growth. How did that make you feel during and after the conversation?

User: I was nervous at first, but once we started talking, I felt more at ease. Afterwards, I was proud of myself for speaking up. It’s nice to see that I can communicate better.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you felt proud of yourself. Recognizing your progress is an important step. What do you think helped you gain the confidence to express yourself during that situation?

User: I think I'm starting to realize that my feelings and thoughts are valid. I also didn't want to let the issue linger and create more tension.

Consultant: Absolutely, acknowledging your feelings is crucial, and addressing issues before they escalate reflects your growth. How do you feel about maintaining this newfound confidence in future interactions?

User: I’m a bit worried I might revert to old habits, though. I sometimes still feel like I don’t want to stand out or be vulnerable around others.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those worries, especially when navigating changes. What strategies can we explore together to help you maintain your confidence and reduce that fear of vulnerability?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of this experience when I start to feel anxious about speaking up again. I could also practice communication in low-pressure situations.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Reminding yourself of past successes can reinforce your confidence. Practicing in low-pressure environments could also help you feel more comfortable. Are there specific scenarios you have in mind where you can practice this?

User: Yes, I could try talking to classmates more during group work or even joining a club where I can meet new people. 

Consultant: Joining a club could be a fantastic way to expand your social circle and practice your communication skills. What kind of clubs are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about joining the art club or maybe a language exchange group. I like art, and I think meeting people who share similar interests might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Those sound like great options! Engaging in activities you enjoy can create a more relaxed atmosphere for socializing. How do you feel about the idea of joining one of these clubs?

User: I feel excited! However, I'm also a bit nervous about stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: It's perfectly okay to feel nervous. Stepping out of your comfort zone can be challenging but also very rewarding. What will be your plan to ease that initial anxiety when you first join?

User: I think I’ll set small, achievable goals for myself, like introducing myself to one new person at the first meeting.

Consultant: That’s a very sensible plan! Setting small goals can make the experience less daunting. How do you feel about checking in with yourself after each meeting to reflect on how it went?

User: That sounds helpful. I could write down my feelings and any positive interactions I have to remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: Writing down your reflections can be a wonderful tool for reinforcing your confidence. It gives you a chance to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. How does that resonate with you?

User: I really like that idea! It will help keep me focused on the positives, and hopefully help reduce my anxiety about future interactions.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the positives will enable you to build a more supportive narrative for yourself. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway from our conversation that you would like to hold onto moving forward?

User: I think I want to remember that my voice matters and that taking small steps can lead to bigger changes.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Q! Your voice absolutely matters, and each step counts. I’m proud of the progress you've made, and I’m here to support you in this journey. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more help or guidance.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and the strategies we've discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to continue growing. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
