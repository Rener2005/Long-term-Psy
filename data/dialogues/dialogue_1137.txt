Consultant: Hello, Wang. I'm glad you're here today. I know that you've been going through a tough time recently. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty down. Finding out that the guy I liked has a girlfriend was really shocking. I’m still trying to process how I feel about it.

Consultant: I can imagine how disappointing that must have been for you. It's completely understandable to feel this way. Let's explore what emotions have come up for you since this revelation.

User: I feel a strong sense of loss and confusion. I thought there was something special between us, and now that’s gone. I also feel lonely because I don’t think my current boyfriend understands me as much as I need.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of sadness and isolation. This is quite a heavy burden to carry. Can you tell me more about your relationship with your current boyfriend and how it contributes to your feelings?

User: Well, we’ve been together for over a year. But we’re in a long-distance situation, and he’s always busy with work. I sometimes feel like he doesn't prioritize me. It makes me question if I should still stay in this relationship.

Consultant: I see why you're feeling unsure. The distance and lack of communication can really challenge a relationship. How does thinking about possibly ending things with him make you feel?

User: I feel torn. One moment I think it might be for the best, but then I remember all the good times we’ve had, and I miss that connection. It's confusing.

Consultant: That confusion is natural. You want to honor your feelings while also reflecting on what you value in your relationships. What specific experiences or moments do you cherish that make you hesitate to end it?

User: There were moments when he was really supportive and made me feel valued. But those times feel far between now, and I can’t help but question if I’m settling.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing the importance of feeling valued in a relationship. Could we explore what 'feeling valued' looks like for you in your current situation?

User: I think it involves feeling like he makes an effort to check in on me, to be there when I need someone to talk to, or just showing he cares more consistently.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It’s essential to feel supported and cared for. Would you say your expectations of the relationship are being met right now?

User: Not really. I feel like I often have to reach out first, and it leaves me feeling anxious about whether he really cares. The other guy seemed more interested in me, which makes things even more complicated.

Consultant: That makes sense. You’re craving connection and reassurance. Let’s discuss how these unmet needs might be influencing your feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Can you share a specific thought that crosses your mind about your relationship when you feel anxious?

User: I often think, “He doesn’t really love me” or “I’m just not worth his time.” It spirals from there, making me feel worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging. It's crucial to recognize how they impact your emotional state. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those beliefs about your worth in the relationship?

User: I guess there have been times he’s done nice things for me, but those moments are overshadowed by how often I feel neglected.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge both perspectives. Your experiences of feeling disregarded are valid. Could we challenge those negative thoughts? If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell her about her worth?

User: I’d tell her that she deserves someone who shows consistent care and attention. That she’s worth it, no matter how busy someone might be.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re deserving of that same compassion and understanding. It’s worth considering how you can advocate for your own needs in your relationships. How would you feel about discussing ways to communicate that with your boyfriend?

User: I think that could help. I need to be more open with him about my feelings instead of bottling them up. But I worry he won’t understand.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive. However, clear communication can often bring about the understanding you seek. Perhaps starting with how you feel rather than blaming can help. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think I could try starting with my feelings. It might be easier than just pointing fingers.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Remember, it’s about expressing yourself and allowing him to respond. Now, as for your situation with the other guy—what have you learned about your feelings from that experience?

User: I realized how much I crave attention and appreciation. I thought it was normal to feel special in a relationship, and when I didn’t get it with my boyfriend, I found it elsewhere.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Wang. It highlights your need for attention and validation, which is completely valid. How do you think you can address that need while being in your current relationship?

User: Maybe I should focus on expressing my needs more openly, instead of seeking validation from someone outside. It’s hard to let go of how I feel about the other guy, though.

Consultant: It takes time to move on from attachments, especially when you’ve invested emotionally. However, prioritizing your current relationship could lead to growth. What steps could you take to nurture that relationship instead?

User: I guess we could plan more time to talk, maybe some virtual dates. It might help reconnect us.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Routine check-ins can foster closeness. How do you feel about creating a plan for those virtual dates, making them a priority?

User: I feel hopeful. It sounds like a good way to remind each other of what we have.

Consultant: Hope is a positive sign! As we move forward, remember that it’s essential to maintain open dialogue about your feelings. When we communicate our needs, it strengthens relationships. 

User: I’ll definitely try to keep that in mind. It feels like a fresh approach.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. So, as we wrap up today, let’s reflect. What are the key takeaways for you from this session?

User: I’ve realized the importance of communication and that I deserve to feel valued in a relationship. I also need to focus on nurturing what I have rather than looking elsewhere.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reflection, Wang. Embracing your worth will help you grow in your relationships. Remember, if you feel overwhelmed, I’m here to support you. Take care, and we can continue this journey together next time.

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello Wang! It’s great to see you today. I know you’ve been feeling quite anxious lately, especially regarding your studies and your relationships. Can we start by discussing how you're feeling today?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. My grades are slipping, and I can’t seem to focus on my studies at all. It’s like everything is piling up, and I don't know how to handle it.

Consultant: I can understand how daunting that must feel for you. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed; could you share more about what thoughts are going through your mind when you sit down to study?

User: I keep thinking about how much I need to catch up and how I'm going to fail if I don’t. It just makes me freeze up and I can’t start anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to perform well. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that you will fail if you don’t catch up right away?

User: I just feel like all my friends are doing better than me, and I've been getting lower grades. It seems like I can’t keep up.

Consultant: It’s tough when you feel compared to others. Have you ever considered that grades don't define your worth or hard work? What might be a more balanced way to view your situation?

User: I guess I sort of know that deep down, but it feels so real when I see my grades. I don't want to let anyone down, including myself.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Wang. It’s common to tie our self-worth to our performance. What if we aimed to set specific, manageable study goals instead of focusing on the grades alone? How does that sound to you?

User: That could help. Focusing on smaller tasks might make it feel less intimidating. 

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s think about what specific tasks you can focus on. What subject do you find most challenging right now, and how can we break it down?

User: Math is the hardest for me. Maybe I could start by reviewing a few concepts a day or just doing a couple of problems?

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Setting smaller goals can really help. How would you feel about scheduling specific study times for math each week?

User: I think that could help me get into a routine. But I worry that I’ll still feel anxious about it.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious, but we can also introduce some relaxation techniques to help manage that anxiety. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques alongside your study plan?

User: Yes, I think that would be beneficial. I usually feel tense, so I need something to help me calm down.

Consultant: Absolutely! One simple technique is to take deep breaths in for four counts, hold for four, and exhale for four. Would you like to try that together right now?

User: Sure! I can try that.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in together… hold… and now exhale. How do you feel after just that one breath?

User: I feel a little calmer actually. It’s nice to take that moment.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating that into your study sessions could help reduce anxiety. Now, let's shift gears for a moment. How are you feeling about your relationships, especially with the boy you mentioned?

User: I’m really confused. I like him a lot, but then finding out he has a girlfriend hurt, and I don’t know what to think about it all.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s difficult when feelings are involved. What do you think might happen if you confronted that confusion? 

User: I guess I’m worried about making things awkward or ruining our friendship.

Consultant: That concern is valid. Sometimes, being open about our feelings can bring clarity, but it’s also about timing and your comfort. Have you considered what outcome you hope for from a conversation with him?

User: I just want to know where I stand. I don't want to wait around for something that's never going to happen.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective. Taking control of your own feelings and understanding the situation could empower you. Let’s think about how you could approach that conversation. 

User: Maybe I could casually bring it up next time we’re hanging out? 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. How might you express your feelings without putting too much pressure on the situation?

User: I could say something like "hey, I've liked spending time with you, and I’m curious about where we’re at."

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! It’s open-ended and invites a conversation. How do you feel about making that approach?

User: I feel nervous, but also a bit relieved to have a plan. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Remember, expressing your thoughts is a step towards clarity. As we wrap up, let's summarize the key points we've discussed. What strategies will you take away from our session today?

User: I’ll start breaking my study tasks into smaller pieces, practice relaxation techniques, and talk to him about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! You’re taking proactive steps toward both your academic and personal life. Before we end today's session, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?

User: No, I think we covered everything. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang. Remember, it’s a process, and I'm here to support you along the way. I look forward to seeing your progress in the next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here with me today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi. Honestly, I have been feeling really pressured. I find it hard to concentrate on my studies because I'm worried about my performance and how I relate to my classmates.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’re facing a lot of stress regarding your exams and your social interactions. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically is causing you the most anxiety?

User: Well, I feel like I'm falling behind in my studies, and on top of that, I'm worried about my relationships with my classmates. I'm not sure if they see me as a friend. It just feels so overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling overwhelmed with both academic pressure and concerns about friendships. How do these thoughts affect your day-to-day activities, like studying or interacting with others?

User: When I sit down to study, my mind just races with worries about failing and also about whether my classmates think I'm awkward. I sometimes just end up scrolling on my phone instead of focusing.

Consultant: It seems like your worries are making it difficult for you to stay focused on your studies. Let’s take a moment to explore these thoughts. When you think about failing, what specific thoughts come up for you?

User: I guess I think that if I don’t do well, it’ll make me look stupid and that my classmates will judge me. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the pressure of exams. However, let’s challenge that thought a bit. Is there evidence to support the idea that not performing perfectly would lead to your classmates judging you harshly?

User: I suppose I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just a fear I have. But still, I feel like they’re all smarter than me.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, but let’s think about it: Would you judge someone else in your class harshly for not doing perfectly? 

User: No, I would probably understand that everyone has their struggles. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remind yourself that everyone is navigating their own challenges. Let’s try to reframe that thought. What if you viewed exams as an opportunity to learn rather than a test of your worth?

User: That sounds nicer, but I have a hard time believing it when I’m so stressed out.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. It might take some practice to shift those thoughts. Perhaps we could develop some strategies together that can help you manage that stress and build your confidence in social settings?

User: Yes, I would like that. I just don’t want to feel this anxious anymore.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with some small step ideas to cope with anxiety during study sessions. How do you feel about setting specific time blocks for studying, followed by short breaks to clear your mind?

User: That could work. I tend to procrastinate, and I think having a structure might help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! A structure can create a sense of control and reduce anxiety. Now, let’s also think about your social interactions. Are there specific situations with your classmates that seem particularly daunting to you?

User: Sometimes, I feel nervous when I wish to join their conversations. I just stay silent because I worry I won't know what to say.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel nervous about joining in. What if we role-play a scenario where you introduce yourself in a group? This could help you practice how to engage in those conversations.

User: That could help, but I still feel scared of judgment.

Consultant: Fear of judgment is common, but practicing can help lessen that fear. How about we try to create a safe space for you to practice? You can try bringing up a topic you enjoy with me first.

User: Okay, let’s try. I recently got into painting, and I would love to share that with them!

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Painting is such a great choice. Let’s practice how you might introduce that to your classmates. You could say something like, “Hey everyone, I’ve been exploring painting, and it’s been a fun way for me to express myself. Have any of you tried it?”

User: That sounds okay. I can see that could spark a conversation!

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, your classmates might surprise you with their responses. They might be more interested than you expect. Let’s work on building your confidence in these interactions moving forward.

User: I really hope I can feel more comfortable. I just want to be able to connect with them.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Wang. We can certainly work towards that. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You’ve started to challenge some of those negative thoughts and developed some strategies for studying and socializing.

User: Yes, I feel like I have a plan now, which is relieving. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Keep practicing these new strategies, and remember that progress takes time. If you encounter challenges, we can address them together next time. 

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel hopeful about the next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’ve taken today. Looking forward to our next session, and take care until then!

Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you've been feeling uncertain about your social skills lately. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically has been troubling you?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling really isolated after that gathering with friends. I thought I could connect better, but I just felt awkward and out of place. It makes me doubt my ability to socialize.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience at the gathering really affected you. Feeling awkward can be tough, especially when you're trying to connect with others. What thoughts went through your mind during that interaction?

User: I kept thinking that I was saying the wrong things and that people must have found me boring. I just wanted to disappear at times during the conversation.

Consultant: I see; those thoughts can be really harsh. It's clear that you're quite critical of yourself in social situations. When you were feeling like you wanted to disappear, what emotions were you experiencing?

User: I felt anxious and a bit embarrassed. It was like everyone else was having fun, and I was just... there, not contributing anything meaningful.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable, Wang. It's common to feel anxious when we perceive our interactions as not going well. Do you think there are specific beliefs that contribute to these feelings during social gatherings?

User: I guess I think that I always have to be interesting or funny to fit in. If I don't live up to that, I feel like I've failed somehow.

Consultant: That's a very understandable belief, but it can be quite limiting. Let's explore it. What evidence do you think supports this belief that you always need to be interesting or funny?

User: I don't have concrete evidence, but I've seen my friends easily make others laugh. I suppose I just feel pressured to keep up.

Consultant: It's great that you're analyzing this thought! If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them to approach the situation?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and that not every moment has to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like you recognize the value of authenticity over perfection. Can we work on reframing that belief for yourself? Instead of focusing on being interesting, how about thinking about simply enjoying the moment?

User: That makes sense. I do want to enjoy being with others without overthinking everything.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! What small step can you take next time you're in a social setting to focus on enjoyment rather than feeling the pressure to perform?

User: Maybe I can try to ask questions and listen more instead of worrying about what I say. That way, I can connect with others without stressing myself out.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! By focusing on listening, you'll naturally engage more and take the pressure off yourself. How do you feel about approaching your next social event like that?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s less daunting if I think about it this way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, social interactions are as much about others as they are about you. We can practice some common questions or prompts you could use to get the conversation going next time.

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I often struggle to think of things to say.

Consultant: Alright, let’s brainstorm a few. How about starting with topics like recent movies, or asking about what everyone is looking forward to? 

User: Those are great ideas! I can see how they might work.

Consultant: Fantastic! And while you're practicing these skills, remember to also be kind to yourself. It’s okay if every interaction isn’t perfect. How does that resonate with you?

User: It makes me feel better. I realize that it’s normal to have ups and downs socially.

Consultant: Exactly! Each interaction is a learning opportunity. Let’s also talk about how you can prepare mentally before these gatherings. What might help you feel more confident going in?

User: I could remind myself to focus on being present rather than on how I’m perceived.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Checking in with yourself to refocus your goals will definitely help. Is there anything else that you’d like to explore today regarding your feelings or thoughts about your relationships?

User: Yes, I still feel conflicted about my boyfriend. I’m not sure if I really want to stay with him.

Consultant: It sounds like there are some mixed emotions there. Can you share what’s contributing to your uncertainty about the relationship?

User: I care for him, but I feel like he doesn't really understand me or give me enough attention. 

Consultant: It’s essential to feel understood and valued in a relationship. What specific aspects make you feel misunderstood or neglected?

User: He’s super busy with work, and sometimes I feel like I’m not a priority for him. 

Consultant: It’s understandable you’re feeling this way. How do you think you might communicate these feelings with him? 

User: I could try to share how I feel when I don’t hear from him for a while but also ask him about his perspective.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Open communication is key. How do you feel about having that conversation with him?

User: I feel nervous, but I know it’s important. I just want to be honest without pushing him away.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Remember, being honest doesn’t have to mean being confrontational. You’re expressing your feelings to strengthen the relationship. Is there anything else you’d like to address today?

User: I think I just want to feel more clear and confident in my decisions moving forward. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining clarity about your emotions and decisions is a significant part of this process. I believe the steps we've discussed today will lead you towards that clarity. How are you feeling about our conversation so far?

User: I feel hopeful. It's nice to talk through my feelings instead of bottling them up. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and each step you take brings you closer to understanding yourself better. Let’s continue exploring these topics in our next sessions. 

User: I appreciate that. Thank you for your help today; it really means a lot. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang! I'm looking forward to our next session together. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself in the meantime!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you today. You mentioned wanting to understand your emotional state better and find clarity in your decision-making. Can we start by discussing what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been really struggling with my feelings lately. I liked this guy I spent time with, but then he introduced his girlfriend, which crushed me. I have a boyfriend too, but things feel so dull and distant between us. Now I’m thinking about whether I should break up with him or not.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You’re dealing with mixed feelings about both relationships, and it’s completely understandable to feel conflicted. What is it about your current relationship that feels unsatisfying to you?

User: I just feel like he doesn't really understand me or my needs. We’ve been together for over a year, but he's often busy with work, and it feels like I'm just waiting around.

Consultant: That feeling of waiting can be really frustrating. It sounds like you’re yearning for more connection and understanding. What do you think you need from a partner to feel valued and understood?

User: I guess I want someone who is there for me emotionally, who can support me and pay attention to my feelings. I wish my boyfriend could do that.

Consultant: It makes complete sense that you desire emotional support and connection in a relationship. Reflecting on your relationship with your current boyfriend, are there specific moments where you felt particularly distant from him or moments when you felt supported?

User: I can think of times when I wanted to talk about my day or my feelings, but he was preoccupied with his work or just didn’t engage much. Sometimes I feel invisible to him.

Consultant: Feeling invisible in a relationship can be incredibly painful. It must be difficult to open up when you feel that way. Now, regarding the guy from the drifting board, you felt a strong connection with him. How has his introduction of a girlfriend affected your feelings about your current boyfriend?

User: Honestly, it made me question everything. I thought I liked this other guy because he brought excitement, but now I’m stuck thinking if I really want to break up with my boyfriend or if it’s just the thrill of something new that I’m missing.

Consultant: It's natural to find yourself caught between excitement and comfort. Have you allowed yourself to explore what truly makes you happy in a partner? 

User: Not really. I think I got so caught up in feelings for the other guy that I didn’t think clearly about what I really wanted.

Consultant: It’s understandable to get swept away in emotions. Let’s take a moment to attempt to identify some of your core values in a relationship. What are the must-haves for you when thinking about an ideal partner?

User: I think I need someone who is communicative, caring, and someone I can share my interests with. They should be supportive and understanding through tough times.

Consultant: Those are valuable qualities to look for! Reflecting on your current boyfriend, do you think he embodies any of these qualities, or are there areas where you feel lacking?

User: He can be caring at times, but more often than not, it feels like I’m the one putting more effort into the relationship.

Consultant: A relationship should ideally be a partnership, where both people contribute to each other's emotional well-being. Given your insights, what steps can you take to have an open conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and needs?

User: I guess I could express to him how I feel and see if he’s willing to work on being more present and supportive.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Communicating your needs directly might help you gain clarity on where the relationship truly stands. How do you imagine he’ll respond to this discussion?

User: I’m not sure. I hope he’ll be receptive, but I also worry that he might dismiss my feelings, like he often does.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to have these concerns. If he doesn’t respond positively, how will that affect your feelings toward continuing the relationship?

User: I think I’d feel even more frustrated and might want to seriously reconsider things. 

Consultant: That indeed could be a crucial turning point. If that happens, it might help to reflect on the reasons you valued the relationship in the first place. What does a healthy relationship look like for you?

User: A healthy relationship should feel mutual. I want to feel appreciated and like we’re working together as a team.

Consultant: Working together as a team is essential! It’s important for both people to feel equally valued. What are a few practical steps you can take after this conversation, whether it leads to positive change or further reflection?

User: I could think about my own needs more clearly and also what I want in future relationships. Maybe I should also spend more time reflecting on what makes me happy, regardless of relationships.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking time to understand yourself better will guide you toward healthier relationships in the future. How are you feeling about all these insights we’ve explored today?

User: I feel a bit more grounded. It helps to see things from a clearer perspective. I think I'll try having that conversation and just see where it leads.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you feel more grounded. It’s a positive step forward. Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your own needs and feelings, and being open about them is a strength. Would you like to summarize what we've discussed today?

User: Sure! I’ve realized that I need emotional support and clear communication in a relationship. I’ll prioritize having a discussion with my boyfriend about my feelings and also take time to reflect on my own needs and desires.

Consultant: That’s excellent! You’ve made significant progress in understanding your feelings and recognizing your needs. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it’s that I need to communicate better about what I want and also take time to understand myself. I feel more empowered to make my own decisions now.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Wang! Recognizing your needs and feeling empowered is a huge step in your journey. Remember, take it one day at a time, and give yourself the space to reflect. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. It’s been a pleasure talking with you today!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling more stable lately. I've been trying to put my emotions in order and it's been going relatively well. However, I still have some lingering thoughts about my previous relationships and what I should do moving forward.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more stable! Emotions often take time to settle, especially when it comes to relationships. What are the main thoughts you've been struggling with regarding your past relationships?

User: Well, I keep thinking about my ex-boyfriend. After breaking up, I felt like he didn't understand me enough. But now, I find myself missing him and questioning whether I should try to get back together or not.

Consultant: That's perfectly normal. Missing someone after a breakup can create a lot of uncertainty. You mentioned feeling like he didn't give you enough care and understanding. Could you help me understand what specifically made you feel that way during your relationship?

User: It always felt like he was too busy with work to really listen to me or support me when I needed it. It made me feel alone, like I wasn't important to him. But now that we're apart, I often remember the good things about him, which confuses me.

Consultant: Those feelings of neglect can be painful, and it's understandable you'd miss the good moments. It sounds like you're experiencing a conflict between your past feelings and your current needs. In the context of your relationship with your ex-boyfriend, what do you believe you need most right now?

User: I think I need someone who can be present and supportive. I want to feel valued and understood, but I’m uncertain if he can do that now.

Consultant: It seems like you're craving validation and connection. When you think back to your relationship, do you see any specific instances where he did show you support or care?

User: There were times when he was sweet and attentive, but those moments felt rare compared to the times I felt neglected. I guess that's what makes it so confusing.

Consultant: It's important to recognize both the highs and lows of a relationship. Balancing those emotions can be tricky. Given your need for support, how do you feel about your current relationship? Do you feel it provides you with the care you seek?

User: To be honest, it feels quite bland with my current boyfriend. We go to the same school, but I often wonder if he really cares about me. I don’t feel the same excitement or support.

Consultant: Feeling disconnected can be tough. It's essential to have someone who truly values you. If you were to reflect on what you desire in a partner, what qualities would stand out?

User: I would like someone who's communicative, caring, and who actively shows interest in my life. Those qualities would help me feel secure and happy.

Consultant: Those are valuable qualities to seek! Have you considered discussing your needs with your current boyfriend to see if he can meet them?

User: I have thought about it, but I'm afraid it would create more distance if I were to bring it up. What if he thinks I’m being too needy?

Consultant: It's natural to have that concern. Communicating your needs doesn't make you needy; it can actually foster closeness. Think of it as an opportunity to understand each other better. What if you approached the conversation as sharing your feelings rather than making demands?

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe if I frame it as me expressing my feelings, it would feel less confrontational.
