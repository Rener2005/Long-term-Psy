Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today’s session. I want to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite sad and lost since my breakup. I also just found out I failed a major course, and it’s really weighing on me. 

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. Breakups can be really difficult, especially when coupled with academic pressures. Can you share more about how these experiences are affecting your day-to-day life?

User: Well, I don't really want to go to class anymore. It all feels pointless, and when I sit down to study, I just feel overwhelmed. I doubt myself more now.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and self-doubt. These feelings can make it hard to focus on your studies. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your studies or your future?

User: I keep thinking that I might not be good enough for this major or that I won't be successful. I worry a lot about what will happen if I fail more classes.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It’s understandable to feel this way, especially during such a challenging time. What emotions do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even hopeless. It’s like a constant weight on my chest. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough to carry. Let's try to pinpoint those negative thoughts. When you're thinking, "I'm not good enough," what evidence supports that thought for you?

User: Well, I just failed a class, and it feels like everyone else is doing better. I think maybe I’m just not cut out for this.

Consultant: It’s really important to remember that failing one class doesn’t define your abilities overall. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them? 

User: I’d probably tell them it’s just one setback and that they can still succeed if they keep trying. 

Consultant: That’s a very supportive stance to have for your friend. Now, let’s think about how we can apply that perspective to yourself. What might be a different way to view your situation?

User: Maybe I could see this as a chance to learn and improve instead of just a failure. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing it as an opportunity for growth can be very empowering. What steps do you think you could take to start improving your situation moving forward?

User: I guess I could create a study schedule and reach out for help from my professors. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Taking proactive steps can help you feel more in control. How does the thought of reaching out for help make you feel?

User: It makes me a bit anxious, but I also think it could help me feel less alone in this. 

Consultant: That’s a really healthy realization. It’s normal to feel anxious about reaching out, yet it can lead to support and understanding. What’s one small action you could take this week to start this process?

User: Maybe I could email my professor to ask about extra tutoring options.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect first step! Setting manageable goals can decrease anxiety and help build confidence. How are you feeling about your ability to follow through with that?

User: I think I can do it, but I’m still nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. What can we do together right now to help lessen that nervousness you may feel before sending that email? 

User: Maybe we could talk about what I could say in the email to make it easier?

Consultant: Sure! We can draft a simple and clear email together. How about starting with a brief introduction and mentioning that you’re seeking extra help?

User: That sounds good. I could say something like, “I’m struggling and would like to discuss options for help.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! You’re expressing your needs clearly. Would you like to write out the email now, or would you prefer to set it as a goal to complete after our session? 

User: I think I’ll set it as a goal to work on after our session. I feel less overwhelmed just thinking about it!

Consultant: Sounds good! Setting it as a goal can definitely help you feel empowered. Let’s reflect on what we’ve covered today. What stands out to you as a key takeaway?

User: I’ve realized that my negative thoughts don’t have to define me, and that taking action might help change how I feel. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, and I’m so glad you see that! Before we end today’s session, let’s talk about maintaining that perspective. How do you think you can remind yourself of this in the future?

User: I could write affirmations for myself or keep a journal of small successes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Keeping track of your progress and reminding yourself of your strengths can be incredibly helpful. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you, that means a lot. I’m hoping to feel a bit better next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. 

User: I will. Thanks again for your help!

Consultant: Take care, and have a great week ahead!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. The pressure of studying for my retake exams is really getting to me. I can't seem to focus, and it just adds to my anxiety about possibly failing.

Consultant: I understand that the pressure of retake exams can feel really heavy, especially when you're struggling to concentrate. Let's talk about this a bit more. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you sit down to study?

User: It’s like, I sit down and my mind just goes blank. I think, "What if I fail again?" and then I feel even more anxious. It’s a cycle that just never seems to stop.

Consultant: That sounds really exhausting. It seems like the fear of failing is making it hard for you to get started. When you think, "What if I fail again?" how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really helpless. Like, I’m not even sure why I’m in college anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down, especially my parents.

Consultant: Feeling helpless and worrying about letting others down can be very distressing. Let's explore this further. Is there any evidence that supports that you will fail? Or maybe any evidence that suggests you might succeed?

User: Well, I did okay in my last exam, but it just feels like nothing I do is good enough. Every time I try to study, I just get more frustrated and anxious.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize you did okay in your last exam. That shows what you're capable of when you're focused. What if we try to reframe this? Instead of thinking, "Nothing I do is good enough," what if we look at it as "I can find a way to improve my study habits"?

User: That makes sense, but it’s hard to change how I think in the moment. I just feel overwhelmed with everything. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take a step back. Have you thought about breaking down your study sessions into smaller, manageable tasks? This can sometimes help with the feeling of being overwhelmed.

User: I haven’t really done that. I usually just set a long time to study, but I often end up getting distracted or feeling too anxious.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. How about we create a study plan that sets short, focused study periods with breaks in between? This way, you can reduce the pressure and gradually build up your concentration.

User: That sounds like it could help. I like the idea of shorter sessions. 

Consultant: Perfect! How long do you think each study session could be, and how long of a break would you like to take in between each?

User: Maybe 25 minutes of studying and then a 5-minute break? That seems doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You could try using a timer to keep track. Do you think this structure can help to ease some of your anxiety as well?

User: I think it might. At least if I know I'm only studying for a short time, it doesn't feel so daunting.

Consultant: Exactly! Plus, those breaks can give you a moment to reset and refresh your mind. As you try this approach, how do you think it could affect your confidence about your studies?

User: I guess if I can see myself making progress, it might help my confidence. But I'm still afraid of what happens if I don’t do well.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let’s also plan for those "what ifs." When you think about failing, can we identify what those feelings represent for you? 

User: I think it represents disappointment, both in myself and knowing my parents will be upset.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure to meet not just your expectations but also those of your parents. How might we take care of yourself in those moments when you feel this disappointment coming?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I’m doing my best and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful approach! Reminding yourself that it's okay to make mistakes is key. It doesn't define your worth or capability. This can also foster resilience. What do you think about practicing this self-talk during your study sessions?

User: I can try to do that. It will take some effort though.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! Change takes time and practice. It’s about taking it one step at a time. How are you feeling about this strategy so far?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It’s good to have someone to talk things through with.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having support can make a difference. Remember, it’s okay to seek help when things get tough. Now, let’s also think about your social interactions as we work on your study habits. Have you had a chance to connect with classmates lately?

User: Not really. I feel awkward reaching out, especially with my anxiety about exams.

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It can be tough to reach out when you're feeling anxious. What if we brainstorm ways to start small? Maybe participate in a group study session, or even just say hello to a classmate?

User: I guess I could try joining a study group. It might help to be around others who are in the same boat.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Connecting with others can help reduce feelings of isolation and may provide an additional layer of support. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It feels a bit daunting, but I think it could be worth a try. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly fine to feel a bit nervous; just take it at your own pace. I believe in you! As we wrap up today, let's summarize what you've discovered about managing your study anxiety and social interactions.

User: I’ve realized I need to break down my studying, practice positive self-talk, and maybe try to connect with classmates more.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights! As you move forward, reflect on how these strategies can help you build your confidence in both studies and social situations. Let’s plan to talk about how it goes in our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help, it’s nice to have some direction.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you decided to come for this session today. I understand that you've been feeling quite isolated lately? Can you share more about what's been happening?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really cut off from my classmates. I used to be more social, but now I just feel like I don't belong. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and sadness about your social connections. Can you tell me more about specific situations that make you feel this way?

User: Well, when I see my classmates hanging out together, I feel like I want to join them, but I just can't. I get really anxious and think they wouldn’t want me there.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. You mentioned feeling anxious in these situations. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining them?

User: I often think, "What if they don't like me?" or "I’ll probably embarrass myself." These thoughts just make me not want to try at all.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite powerful and negative. Let’s explore them together. How do you feel physically when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel tight in my chest, my palms get sweaty, and I just want to hide away.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It seems your thoughts and physical sensations are feeding into each other. Have you noticed any patterns about when these feelings come up?

User: Yes, it usually happens during lunch or when we have group projects. I end up sitting alone or avoiding those situations.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would avoid situations that bring on discomfort. Let’s consider these thoughts for a moment. What evidence do you have that your classmates wouldn’t want you around?

User: I guess I don't have any real evidence. It’s just how I feel. Sometimes, I think back to times when I didn't fit in well.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize that it's based on feelings rather than facts. If a friend came to you with similar thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it's okay to feel nervous but that it's worth trying to join in. They might surprise themselves and have fun.

Consultant: Very insightful! You would encourage them to give it a shot, despite their fears. How might that apply to your situation?

User: Maybe I should try to be more open to joining in, even if it scares me. I just don’t know where to start.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Let’s think about some small steps you could take to begin to participate more. What’s one simple social activity that feels less intimidating to you?

User: Maybe I could start by just saying hi to someone in my class when we meet.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! It's a manageable step that opens the door to more interaction. How do you feel about setting a goal to try that this week?

User: I think I can try that. It feels a bit less intimidating.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s also think about how you might feel after you’ve taken that step. What kind of positive outcome are you hoping for?

User: I hope it helps me feel more connected and maybe even leads to some new friendships.

Consultant: That’s a lovely goal! Building connections can bring a lot of positivity into your life. What might you do to reward yourself after you try reaching out?

User: I could treat myself to a nice snack or something small to celebrate the effort.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Celebrating small wins is important. As we prepare for your next step, it might also help to know how you’ll handle any negative thoughts that arise after you try connecting with someone.

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that it doesn’t mean they don’t want me around.

Consultant: Excellent! Challenging those negative thoughts will help reinforce your confidence. As we continue these sessions, we will build on these strategies. How are you feeling about all this now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I can see a way forward. It still feels scary, but I think I can try.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling hopeful is a significant step. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Next time we meet, we can chat about how your efforts went. Sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re considering. Remember, it’s all a process, and I’m here to support you along the way. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to sharing my progress.

Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I started participating in some interest group activities at school, and it felt good to talk to my classmates. But I'm still a bit nervous about socializing more.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've taken steps to engage with your classmates! That's a positive change. Can you tell me more about how those experiences have made you feel?

User: Well, it was nice to connect with others, and I enjoyed the activities. But I still often doubt myself and worry that I might embarrass myself in conversations.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous when trying to connect with new people. You're making progress by stepping out of your comfort zone. What do you think could help reduce those feelings of self-doubt when socializing?

User: I think if I keep practicing, it might help. But sometimes I feel overwhelmed and just want to avoid situations where I have to interact with others.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common response to anxiety, but gradually facing those situations can help build your confidence. What activities or events do you think you could commit to in the upcoming weeks to continue this practice?

User: There’s a club meeting this week that I could attend. I’ve been thinking about going but I'm scared that maybe no one will talk to me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're already aware of the opportunities to socialize. Would you be open to setting a small goal for this club meeting, like introducing yourself to one new person?

User: That sounds doable! I could try to say hi to someone. But what if they don’t respond?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s great that you’re thinking about potential outcomes. However, there's also a chance they might respond positively. Remember, you're not alone in feeling nervous; many people experience this. How would you feel about focusing on the potential positive interactions?

User: I suppose I could try to focus on that. I don’t want my worries to hold me back anymore.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! After the meeting, it might be helpful for you to reflect on your experience. How do you think you could document any positive interactions or feelings you have afterward?

User: I could keep a journal about my experiences after each meeting or activity. Writing it down might help me see the positive sides.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Journaling can really help reinforce the positive experiences you have. What are some feelings or thoughts you would like to note down after your next club meeting?

User: I’d like to write about how I felt before and after talking to someone. Maybe how it went and whether it felt easier than I expected.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach! By comparing your thoughts and feelings before and after, you may be able to notice any changes in your emotions. Would you like to share how you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel a bit excited! It seems like a good way to understand my progress.

Consultant: That's a great attitude! Progress often brings excitement, and it's important to celebrate those small victories. How about we set a date for our next session to discuss how it went?

User: Yes, that would be good! I would love to share my experiences with you.

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, remember that every social interaction is an opportunity for growth. In the meantime, are there any other strategies you might want to try to help reduce anxiety before your meeting?

User: Maybe I can practice some deep breathing to calm myself before I go to the meeting. It might help.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective! It can help ground you and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a short practice together now?

User: Sure, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Breathe in deeply through your nose… and hold for a moment… now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a couple more times.

User: That feels nice, actually. It's calming.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating deep breathing before social events can be beneficial. How do you feel about using this technique going forward?

User: I feel good about it. I think it could really help me before meetings.

Consultant: Fantastic! With each step you take, you'll hopefully feel more comfortable. Remember, you're on a journey, and it's completely okay to take your time. We can revisit how you’ve been feeling in our next session. What do you think your biggest takeaway from our conversation today is?

User: I think it’s that I can do this and I should focus on the positives. I’m actually excited to try!

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Focusing on the positives can reshape your experiences. I look forward to hearing all about your progress next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'll work on this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! I'm here for you. Until next time, take care and keep me posted about your experiences.

User: I will! Bye for now.

Consultant: Bye! Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi Liu! I'm glad to see you back for another session. I've noticed positive changes in your experiences lately. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much better, actually. Meeting new friends and participating in group activities has been supportive. It's nice to have people around who understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're starting to feel more connected and supported in your new social interactions. Can you share a little more about how these new friendships have impacted your emotional state?

User: Yeah, I feel a sense of belonging that I didn't have before. It boosts my confidence a bit, and I actually look forward to studying with my new friends. It's a different experience from studying alone.

Consultant: That’s great! It’s important to have a supportive network. What specific benefits do you notice when you study with them compared to studying alone?

User: When I study with them, I feel less overwhelmed. We help each other with topics we find difficult, and it takes the pressure off. I also feel motivated to keep up because everyone else is trying hard too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective. It sounds like you’re leveraging the group dynamics to enhance your motivation and understanding. What are some feelings or thoughts that come up during these study sessions?

User: Sometimes I still worry that I won’t be able to keep up with them or that I’ll slow them down. I guess it’s just that underlying fear of not being good enough.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty in sharing that concern. It’s normal to have those feelings, especially in a new environment. Let’s explore that thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might not be good enough in comparison to your peers?

User: I don’t have concrete evidence—it's just a feeling I have. I remember in high school, I struggled with certain subjects and felt like I was always behind.

Consultant: It makes sense why those past experiences would shape your current feelings. But let’s think critically about this. How might your new circumstances differ from those in high school? 

User: Well, for one, the environment is more collaborative now. My friends are encouraging, and they seem genuinely willing to help. That’s different from high school where I felt more isolated.

Consultant: That’s a significant observation, Liu. You are in a more supportive environment now, which can foster growth rather than hinder it. Let’s reframe that worry. Instead of viewing yourself as a hindrance, how could you see your contributions to the group as valuable?

User: I guess I could see it as an opportunity to learn and grow together instead of just comparing myself to them. I can focus on what I bring to the group, like my enthusiasm or persistence.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your mindset like that can make a big difference. What small action could you take in your next study session to reinforce that perspective?

User: Maybe I can share what I know with them and ask questions. That way, I’d be contributing part of the discussion and allowing myself to learn from their insights.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Engaging in discussion can not only help you reinforce your knowledge but also strengthen your relationships. As you continue to bolster these interactions, how are you planning to manage any lingering anxiety you may feel?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to ask for help. I should practice self-compassion instead of being harsh on myself when I worry.

Consultant: Self-compassion is a powerful tool! It allows you to treat yourself with kindness, especially when facing challenges. In the coming days, how can you cultivate that attitude towards yourself?

User: Maybe I can start journaling about my thoughts and feelings, especially when those worries come up. It might help me to reflect on the good moments, like my friends’ support, which can balance the negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Journaling can help you gain perspective and reinforce positive experiences. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about yourself in this session that you would like to carry forward?

User: I've realized that I have the ability to contribute positively to my relationships and studies. It's important to shift my focus from comparison to collaboration.

Consultant: That insight is powerful! Remember, building these positive connections takes time and patience. As you continue this journey, what actions will you take to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I’ll keep engaging with my friends and focus on collaborative learning. Also, I plan to remind myself of these insights whenever I start to worry.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. It's great to see your growth and optimism. As we conclude our session today, do you feel more equipped to handle your emotions and social interactions going forward?

User: Definitely. I feel more empowered and motivated to pursue my goals and manage my feelings better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made significant strides, and I believe you'll continue to grow. Remember, if you ever need support, I'm here for you. Take care!

User: Thank you so much! I'm really grateful for your help. I'm looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite positive actually. I passed my resit exams and I’ve laid out a detailed plan for the new semester. I feel more motivated now. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant progress. What specific changes have you noticed in your motivation and emotions since you started this plan?

User: I think I’m more excited about my studies now. I feel like I have a clearer direction and my anxiety has lessened a bit. But sometimes I still worry about the workload.

Consultant: It's normal to feel some anxiety about upcoming responsibilities, especially when you're trying to balance everything. Can you tell me what specifically worries you about the workload?

User: I worry that I won't be able to keep up with my studies, or that my plans might not actually work. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the amount of material I have to cover.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with some fear of not meeting your own expectations. When you think about these overwhelming feelings, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think, “What if I fail again?”, or “What if I can't understand the material?” Those thoughts really make me anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and critical. Let’s reflect on them. How realistic do you think those fears are? Have you encountered evidence that supports or disputes those thoughts? 

User: Well, I did pass my resit, and I did put in the effort. So, maybe the fears are a bit exaggerated, but they still creep in.

Consultant: It's great that you could acknowledge your achievements. Often, we can get trapped in negative thinking, even when we have evidence to the contrary. If a friend had similar worries, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them not to focus too much on the "what ifs" and to trust in the work they’ve done. 

Consultant: Exactly! It's helpful to remind yourself of your past successes and to treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend. What strategies can we explore to help you manage these worries when they arise?

User: Maybe I could write down positive affirmations or reminders of my achievements to refer back to when I feel anxious?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of your successes can provide reassurance during challenging times. Are there any activities or routines you’d like to incorporate into your day that might help maintain your positive mindset?

User: I think I’d like to incorporate a small daily ritual, like a short meditation or reflection period to set my intentions for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to start your day with a positive mindset. How about we explore some specific techniques for your meditation or reflection? 

User: I think focusing on gratitude could be beneficial. Like listing three things I’m grateful for each morning.

Consultant: Gratitude practices can indeed help improve overall mood. How do you think routinely focusing on what you're grateful for might impact those feelings of anxiety or worry?

User: I think it would help me shift my focus away from my fears and remind me of the good things I have, which makes me feel better overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting focus can create a more positive framework in your mind. As we continue, let’s consider how we can reinforce these practices in both your academic and social life. What challenges do you anticipate facing as you implement these changes?

User: I guess I worry that I might fall back into old habits if I get too stressed out. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sometimes when stress increases, we revert to familiar behaviors. Let’s brainstorm some strategies to help you stay on track, even during stressful times. What has worked for you in the past?

User: In the past, talking with friends helped. I could also reach out to my parents when I’m struggling.

Consultant: Those sound like effective supports! Maintaining open communication with friends and family can definitely help you navigate difficult feelings. How about we set a plan together for when you do feel overwhelmed or anxious?

User: Yes, I can set reminders to check in with them when I feel stressed. 

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! And what about self-care? What activities help you recharge when you start to feel overwhelmed?

User: I enjoy sketching and listening to music. They help me relax quite a bit.

Consultant: Incorporating your hobbies into your routine is essential. Let’s create specific times in your week dedicated to those activities. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I can set aside an hour several times a week for sketching. 

Consultant: Perfect! It’s important to prioritize those activities that bring you joy. As we prepare to wrap up today, what do you feel has been the most valuable insight from our conversation?

User: I think realizing that I can control my thoughts and that I have support around me makes a big difference. I feel like I have better tools to handle my worries now.

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that! You’ve made remarkable strides today, and you have effective strategies to move forward. Before we finish, let’s reflect on how you can maintain your progress moving forward. What are the key takeaways you’d like to carry with you?

User: I want to focus on gratitude, reach out to my support system, and take time for myself. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful commitments! I believe you can continue to grow and thrive. Remember, you have the tools and support you need. Should you ever need guidance or a space to talk, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and I feel more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu. I'm proud of you for engaging in this process. Good luck, and take care of yourself!
