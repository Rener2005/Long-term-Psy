Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. The work pressure has really built up, and I’m constantly second-guessing myself in social situations. 

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like the pressure at work is intensifying your self-doubt, particularly when it comes to interacting with others. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts or feelings you experience in those social moments?

User: Well, I often worry about what others think of me. If I make a mistake or say something awkward, I feel like they judge me harshly and think less of me.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It seems like you feel trapped in a cycle of thinking that others are constantly evaluating you, which can amplify your anxiety. What kind of emotions do these thoughts evoke in you?

User: I feel anxious, of course, and sometimes even a bit depressed. It makes me want to avoid social situations altogether, which only makes things worse.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to avoid situations that make you feel anxious. However, this avoidance can reinforce those negative feelings. Have there been any recent social situations where you felt this way?

User: Yes, just last week there was a staff meeting where I needed to share some ideas. I was so nervous that I barely spoke up, and afterwards I felt like a failure. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that experience. It sounds like you were really hard on yourself after the meeting. I wonder, what thoughts were going through your mind right before you spoke up—or didn’t?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas weren’t good enough and that everyone would laugh at me. Those thoughts really paralyzed me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite powerful, and it seems they’ve led you to believe that you wouldn't be accepted. Let’s explore that a bit: how likely do you think it is that your colleagues would react negatively to your contributions?

User: I tend to think it’s very likely. I guess that comes from past experiences where I felt dismissed. 

Consultant: Past experiences can certainly shape our perceptions. However, is there a possibility that your colleagues might not be as critical as you think? What about focusing on their responses to other colleagues' ideas?

User: I suppose I’ve noticed that they are generally supportive of others. Maybe I’m just projecting my insecurities onto them.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s common to project our fears onto others. Let’s practice seeing those situations differently. If a colleague shared an idea that wasn’t perfect, how would you respond?

User: I would probably encourage them and share constructive feedback instead of being harsh.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s possible your colleagues would do the same for you. This could be a good reminder to challenge those negative thoughts. If you were to replace "They will judge me" with a more balanced thought, what might that be?

User: I guess a more balanced thought would be, "They might appreciate my input, and even if it’s not perfect, it’s still valuable."

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframing! It can be helpful to hold onto that thought when you find yourself feeling anxious about sharing in the future. What are your thoughts on trying to use this new perspective in your next meeting?

User: I think I could give it a shot. It might help reduce my anxiety, knowing that I can view it differently.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s discuss some small steps you can take to build your confidence before the next meeting. What’s something manageable you feel you could implement to prepare yourself?

User: Maybe I could write down my ideas beforehand and practice saying them out loud. That might make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing can really help ease anxiety. Additionally, you could remind yourself of that balanced thought we worked on. How about setting a specific goal for yourself in the next meeting?

User: I’d like to aim to share at least one of my ideas, even if it’s just a little one.

Consultant: I think that’s a great goal, Zhang Wei! It's a step towards overcoming that avoidance pattern. Would it help to visualize yourself successfully sharing that idea?

User: Yes, visualizing it could help. I’ll try to picture it going well, rather than imagining the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Visualization can really rewire how we approach situations. Before we wrap up for today, how are you feeling about our conversation regarding self-doubt and your social anxiety?

User: I feel a lot more hopeful. It’s good to feel understood and to discuss concrete steps I can take.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, self-doubt can be a tough cycle to break, but you’re on the right path. As we conclude today, let’s summarize some of the strategies we've discussed today.

User: Sure! I’ll challenge my negative thoughts, practice before meetings, visualize success, and aim to contribute at least one idea next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keep reminding yourself that growth takes time. If you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach out. You've made great progress, and I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more equipped to handle these situations now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care, Zhang Wei!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been reflecting on your abilities and how you interact with others. Can you share with me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been trying to work on my self-doubt and social anxiety. I feel like I do okay with my colleagues most of the time, but I still catch myself questioning whether I'm good enough in those interactions.

Consultant: I see. It's great that you've made some progress in your communication with your colleagues. However, it seems like those lingering thoughts of self-doubt can still be quite overwhelming. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you start to question your abilities?

User: Often, I think things like, “They must think I'm not good at my job,” or “I should have said this differently.” It leads me to feel anxious before meetings, and I end up overthinking everything.

Consultant: That's really insightful, Zhang Wei. Those thoughts can definitely fuel anxiety. Let’s take a closer look at how those beliefs affect your feelings during social interactions. When you think, “They must think I'm not good at my job,” how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel nervous and kind of worthless, like I can't contribute anything valuable. It’s as if I’m just waiting for someone to point out my flaws.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds very challenging to carry those feelings of nervousness and worthlessness. In those moments, do you notice if there’s any evidence that really supports that thought about others evaluating you negatively?

User: Not really. I usually don’t get that kind of feedback directly; it’s more of an assumption I make in my head based on my fears.

Consultant: That’s an important observation. You mentioned that it’s more about assumptions rather than solid evidence. Considering that, what would you say to a friend who expressed a similar concern about being judged in their job?

User: I would probably tell them that they’re doing a good job and that they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves, reminding them that everyone has their strengths.

Consultant: Exactly! I love that perspective. You’re already demonstrating compassion towards others, which is crucial. How might you apply that same kindness to your self-talk when facing those doubts?

User: I suppose I can try to remind myself of my strengths too, rather than just focusing on what I think others might be thinking about me.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive strategy, Zhang Wei. Let's explore that further. What are some specific strengths or successful experiences you've had that you can rely on to counter those negative thoughts?

User: Well, I’ve had successful lessons and positive feedback from students in the past. I usually manage to resolve conflicts effectively among my colleagues, too.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Those are excellent examples of your strengths. How might recalling those successes help you feel more confident before social interactions or meetings?

User: It could help me remember that I’m capable and that I've handled situations well before. I guess it could ground me a bit more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Grounding yourself in those achievements can serve as a powerful reminder of your capabilities. Let's work on developing specific phrases you can remind yourself of before interactions. For example, you might tell yourself, "I am capable and have valuable things to contribute." How does that sound? 

User: That sounds really helpful. I’ll try to use that affirmation.

Consultant: Great! Affirmations can be a strong tool in challenging self-doubt. Now, let’s move to the practical side. Can you think of a social situation coming up where you can practice this new self-talk technique?

User: Yes, there’s a team meeting scheduled next week. I usually feel a lot of pressure during those.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s an ideal opportunity to practice. Before the meeting, you can remind yourself of your strengths and say your affirmation. What else could you do to prepare yourself for that meeting?

User: I could prepare a few points I want to bring up during the discussion so that I feel more confident.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparation can provide a sense of control and reduce anxiety. What specific points do you think you’d like to share in that meeting?

User: I’d like to suggest some new teaching strategies that have worked well for me lately. I think they could benefit our students.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic contribution! You’re bringing value to the table, and that’s something to be proud of. How do you anticipate discussing your ideas with your colleagues?

User: I imagine I might feel a bit nervous, but I think if I focus on the positives, it will go better than I expect.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have. Remember, you’re not alone in feeling nervous; those feelings are completely normal. How would you like to remind yourself of your preparation and strengths right before the meeting starts?

User: Maybe I can take a few deep breaths and repeat my affirmation a couple of times to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be a great way to center yourself. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve identified self-doubt and you’re working on replacing those negative thoughts with positive affirmations. You also have specific strategies for your upcoming meeting. How do you feel about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel more hopeful. Challenging those negative thoughts seems manageable now, and I’m excited to try out my strategies in the meeting.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhang Wei! You've made significant strides today. Remember, the key is practice; the more you practice these strategies, the easier they will become. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we conclude?

User: No, I think I’ve got a clearer sense of what to do now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you can reach out anytime you need support. I look forward to hearing how the meeting goes next time we talk. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I’m glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve been going through quite a lot recently. Can you tell me more about your feelings and what specifically has been on your mind?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling really anxious about working on a team project at school. I worry a lot about how I communicate and what my colleagues think of me. It makes me feel very self-critical and isolated.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like your self-doubt and sensitivity to others' opinions are really affecting how you feel in social situations. Can you describe a particular moment during the team project when you felt especially anxious?

User: There was one meeting where I completely lost my train of thought while trying to contribute. I felt embarrassed and worried that my team would think I wasn’t prepared or that I wasn’t adding anything valuable.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're in a group setting. Let’s take a moment to reflect on that experience. What thoughts were running through your mind during the meeting that made you feel embarrassed?

User: I kept thinking that everyone must think I'm incompetent or that I'm slowing the team down. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. Let’s explore them a bit. How true do you think those assumptions are? Can you find any evidence that supports or refutes those thoughts?

User: I guess I don't really have concrete evidence that they think that. I tend to jump to conclusions based on my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It sounds like your anxiety might be leading you to interpret situations in a very negative light. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their contributions and worth in the team?

User: I would probably reassure them that everyone has moments of uncertainty and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to be compassionate toward others than ourselves. Let’s try to redirect that self-compassion towards you. How can you remind yourself that making mistakes is a normal part of learning and contributing in a team?

User: I suppose I could remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Maybe I could also try to focus on the positive feedback I receive from my colleagues.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Focusing on positive feedback can help balance the negative thoughts that emerge. How about we discuss some techniques to actively listen and express yourself during these interactions? 

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I want to feel more confident speaking up.

Consultant: Perfect! Active listening involves fully concentrating, understanding, and responding to what others are saying. One technique is to paraphrase what you’ve heard before responding. Would you like to practice this with me now?

User: Sure! I think that could be good practice. 

Consultant: Great! I’ll say something, and you respond back with your understanding. “I feel that teamwork can be challenging because everyone has different perspectives.” 

User: So, you’re saying that teamwork can be tough because everyone has their own views?

Consultant: Exactly! You did a wonderful job of paraphrasing. Practicing this will not only help you focus on the conversation but also give you a moment to gather your thoughts before you respond. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels much more manageable to respond that way. I like that it gives me time to think.

Consultant: I'm glad you found that helpful! Another aspect we can practice is expressing your own ideas clearly. One approach is to start with a simple statement, then share your thoughts. For example, “I believe that…” or “In my opinion…”. Would you like to try expressing a viewpoint using this method?

User: Yes, I can give it a shot. Let’s say, “I believe that clear communication can improve our teamwork.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! By prefacing your points with “I believe” you’re taking ownership of your ideas, which can help you feel more confident. How did that feel for you?

User: It feels good, but I still worry I'll be judged if my idea isn't well-received.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way. Remember, judgment in a team environment often stems from a desire to collaborate and improve, not from a personal attack. How could you remind yourself of this when you feel anxious about sharing your ideas?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that constructive criticism is a chance to grow, and it doesn’t define my worth.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing feedback as an opportunity rather than a judgment can shift your perspective significantly. Let’s make it a part of your routine to practice these techniques. Would you like to create a specific plan for your next team interactions?

User: Yes, I’d appreciate that. I think having a plan will keep me more focused.

Consultant: Great! How about we outline some specific goals? For instance, you could aim to contribute at least one idea in every meeting and practice active listening. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds achievable. I’d like to start making these changes.

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for wanting to take these steps, Zhang Wei! As we wrap up today's session, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I feel like learning to communicate effectively will not only help me in this project but also ease my social anxiety in general.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Remember, practice makes progress. Before our next session, think about those strategies we discussed and consider journaling your experiences. I look forward to hearing how it goes!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely do that. I’m feeling more positive about tackling this now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you, and I believe in your ability to improve. If you need me, I’m just a message away. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. Joining the social anxiety support group has helped me recognize some of my misunderstandings about social interactions. It's nice to talk to people who understand what I'm going through. But I still feel anxious when I try to engage with others.

Consultant: That's great to hear that the support group has provided you with some insights! It’s understandable to still feel anxious despite these new understandings. Could you share a specific situation where you felt that anxiety creeping back in?

User: Yes, there was a group meeting where I felt really self-conscious about speaking up. I had some thoughts about how people might judge me. It made me hesitate to share my experiences, even though I wanted to.

Consultant: It sounds like the fear of judgment influenced your decision to hold back during the meeting. What thoughts were you having at that moment that contributed to your anxiety?

User: I kept thinking that anything I said would sound stupid, and that everyone would judge me harshly for it.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very powerful! Let’s explore them a bit. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that others would judge you harshly for speaking up?

User: I’d say maybe a 7. It feels very real when I'm in the moment, but I know logically that I can't read their minds.

Consultant: It's very insightful that you recognize the difference between feeling it strongly and knowing that it might not be true. What alternative thoughts could you consider that might help reduce that anxiety during group discussions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone is there to support each other and that they probably appreciate hearing different viewpoints.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic alternative! Focusing on the supportive atmosphere can indeed change your perspective. Could we practice role-playing a scenario where you share your thoughts with the group, using that positive mindset?

User: Sure, I think that could help.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you are in the group, and it's your turn to share. What might you say to start?

User: I would say, “I appreciate being part of this group, and I’d like to share something that helped me understand my social anxiety better.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful opening! You’re expressing appreciation and taking ownership of your experience. What feelings do you think might come up for you once you’ve said that?

User: I think I would feel relieved, maybe even a bit proud for speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a positive feeling to aim for! Now, imagine the group’s reaction after you speak. How do you think they would respond to your sharing?

User: I hope they’d relate to what I’ve said or maybe even thank me for sharing.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to visualize a supportive response, which is encouraging. Can we try practicing this together a few more times, focusing on maintaining that positive mindset?

User: Yes, I’d like to practice that!

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s switch roles. You can share your thoughts again, and I’ll portray a member of the group responding to you.

User: Okay! “I appreciate being part of this group, and I’d like to share something that helped me understand my social anxiety better.” 

Consultant: “Thank you for sharing that, Zhang Wei! It’s really helpful to hear your perspective. I think many of us can relate to what you’re feeling.”

User: That felt good! It’s nice to imagine that kind of response.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Reinforcing these positive experiences is crucial. How do you feel now about sharing in the actual group setting?

User: I feel a lot more confident. It seems more manageable to step outside my comfort zone.

Consultant: That's a meaningful shift! Before our session ends, let's discuss some strategies to continue building your confidence for the next group meeting. What specific goals might you set for yourself?

User: I could aim to share at least once during the next meeting and practice some of these positive thoughts beforehand.

Consultant: That’s a concrete and achievable goal! Remember to acknowledge any small steps you take. How do you feel about wrapping up our session today?

User: I feel good! I appreciate the support and practice we've done. I’m excited to try out what I’ve learned.

Consultant: You’ve made significant progress today, Zhang Wei. Keep reminding yourself of your capabilities, and if you face any challenges, we can address them in our next session. Thank you for your openness today!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after participating in the role-playing activity?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The role-playing helped me express myself better, and I’ve noticed that I feel a bit more confident in social situations.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Gaining confidence through role-playing is a great step. Can you share a specific moment or situation where you felt more confident after the activity?

User: Well, the other day, I had a group discussion with my colleagues. I was able to share my ideas without hesitating, which is something I usually struggle with. 

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! It sounds like role-playing has really helped you to communicate more freely. How did it feel to speak up in that discussion?

User: It felt empowering, honestly. I was surprised at how much I contributed without feeling anxious. It was different from before when I would have held back.

Consultant: It’s amazing to hear about this shift! Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What thoughts ran through your mind during that discussion, and how were they different from your usual thoughts?

User: I think I told myself that my contributions were valuable, which helped me feel more comfortable. Usually, I would doubt myself and worry about being judged. 

Consultant: That’s a significant change in your mindset! It seems like you challenged those negative thoughts that often hold you back. Have you been able to apply this mindset in other social scenarios as well?

User: Yes, I've tried to remind myself to focus on being present and engaging with others. Last week, I joined a social gathering, and I didn’t feel as overwhelmed as I usually do.

Consultant: That's excellent progress! It looks like you are actively working on applying the skills you've learned. What strategies do you think helped you manage that social situation better?

User: I focused on listening more and asking questions to keep the conversation going, which made me less anxious about what I should say next.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Engaging with others by asking questions can certainly help lighten the pressure. How did that approach make you feel during the gathering?

User: It was nice. I felt connected, and I wasn’t just thinking about how I was being perceived. It was a relief!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Feeling connected can really improve your experience in social settings. Moving forward, are there any specific situations in which you want to practice these skills more?

User: I want to work on speaking during staff meetings. I still get nervous when I have to share my ideas in front of everyone.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal. Speaking in front of a group can be challenging, but you’ve already demonstrated improvement. Can we brainstorm some strategies together for your next meeting?

User: Sure! I think I could have a few points prepared in advance so that I feel more confident when it’s my turn to speak.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Preparing talking points can really help ease your nerves. How about we also practice visualizing yourself successfully sharing your ideas in the meeting? 

User: I like that idea! Visualization sounds helpful to reinforce this positive mindset.

Consultant: Great! Let’s wrap up our session today by discussing how you can continue to use these techniques and maintain the progress you've made. What do you think will be your biggest challenge in applying these skills consistently?

User: I think the challenge will be my tendency to overthink and doubt myself, especially in new or important discussions.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. It might help to remind yourself of the successes you’ve had recently when those doubts creep in. How do you feel about keeping a journal of these successes?

User: That sounds beneficial! Writing it down could help me reflect and remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reinforcing positive experiences. As we conclude, remember that you’ve made significant strides in overcoming your social anxiety. What’s your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can control my thoughts and that expressing myself isn’t as scary as I used to believe. It’s all about practice and perspective.

Consultant: That's an insightful realization! I’m so proud of the progress you've made. Remember, it’s all about practice and patience. Feel free to reach out whenever you need more support or guidance in the future.

User: Thank you so much for your help! I feel much more optimistic now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your continued successes in the future. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to have you back for our session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. My social interactions with colleagues have improved, and I feel less burdened. But there's still this lingering doubt in my mind about whether I can keep it up.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've seen improvements in your social interactions. It’s completely normal to have some doubts, especially after making progress. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about maintaining this positive change?

User: I guess I’m just afraid that I’ll slip back into my old habits. Sometimes I still feel sensitive to what others think of me, and I worry that I might lose the confidence I've gained.

Consultant: That sounds understandable. So, you're concerned about reverting to those feelings of self-doubt when faced with social situations. Let’s explore that a bit. Can you recall a situation recently where you felt confident? What thoughts were going through your mind then?

User: Well, just last week, I was able to join a conversation during a team meeting. I felt really good and even contributed some ideas. I remember thinking that my opinions mattered and that I had something valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! You felt confident because you recognized your value in the discussion. How did that experience affect your feelings about your work and interactions with colleagues afterward?

User: It gave me a boost! I felt happier to go to work and more willing to engage with my colleagues. But then I had a quiet moment later, and those doubts crept back in.

Consultant: It’s great that you experienced such a positive boost from your contribution, but it’s also common for doubts to resurface. When those doubts come back, what thoughts tend to appear in your mind?

User: I often think that my contributions might not be as good as others or that maybe they were just being polite. It’s like I can’t accept that I did well.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle to be in. You’re being very hard on yourself. Can you recognize any patterns in these thoughts? For instance, do they feel extreme or all-or-nothing?

User: Yes, definitely. It's like I either think I'm brilliant or completely inadequate, with no middle ground.

Consultant: Recognizing those patterns is a great first step. What if we challenge those thoughts together? Could you think of any evidence that might support a more balanced view of your contributions?

User: I guess I could consider the positive feedback I received from my teammates. They seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say.

Consultant: That’s valuable evidence! So you did have a positive impact on your team. Next time you notice those extreme thoughts, could you remind yourself of that feedback and the fact that everyone has different strengths?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think I need to remind myself more often that everyone has their own way of contributing.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's all about finding that balance and acknowledging your own unique contributions. As we continue, let’s also discuss some strategies for when you start feeling those doubts arise. What can you do in those moments to help ground yourself?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself of my accomplishments, like the team meeting. It might help put things in perspective.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Practicing mindfulness can really help in those moments. It’s about creating space between the thought and your reaction. Let's make a plan for how you can use that technique the next time you feel anxious.

User: Okay! I like that. Also, I think it would be helpful to talk about how to handle negative feedback if that comes up.

Consultant: That’s a great topic to explore. Handling feedback is a crucial skill. How do you usually react to negative feedback when it happens?

User: Normally, I feel very defensive or upset, which makes it hard to process it rationally.

Consultant: It’s a common reaction. How about we work on reframing the way you view feedback? What if you saw it as an opportunity for growth rather than a personal attack?

User: I think that could help. If I could look at it more objectively, I might be able to learn from it instead of feeling so hurt.

Consultant: Exactly! Feedback is often about the work, not a reflection of your worth. Would you be open to trying some role-playing exercises next time we meet to practice this?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! It might give me more confidence in real situations.

Consultant: Great! We can role-play different scenarios to help you feel more prepared. Also, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today. You've identified your positive contributions and patterns in your thinking, and you’ve learned a grounding technique for managing doubts. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a sense of relief. I didn’t realize I had made so much progress and that I have tools to handle my doubts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Before we wrap up, what is one key takeaway you’d like to hold onto from today’s session?

User: I’d like to remember that I can contribute meaningfully and that it’s okay to challenge my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Keep reminding yourself of your worth and your abilities. If you find yourself struggling, come back to that thought. Whenever you feel ready, we can continue our work together. You're doing wonderfully, Zhang Wei!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more confident about moving forward.

Consultant: I'm proud of the progress you've made. As we end our session today, remember that you have the tools to navigate these challenges. You're always welcome to return if you need support in the future. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will.
