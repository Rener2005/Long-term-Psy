Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Chen! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I'm feeling really upset. I think my teachers and classmates don't understand me. Recently, I did something not nice in class, and now everyone is mad at me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's completely understandable to feel upset when you think others aren’t understanding you. Can you tell me more about what happened in class that made you feel this way?

User: Well, I got really frustrated during English class and, um, I messed up my classmate's test paper. I felt so angry, but now I just feel sad because I think everyone hates me.

Consultant: It's clear that your feelings are very intense right now. It sounds like your anger was overwhelming in that moment. What usually makes you feel frustrated like that in class?

User: I don’t know... Sometimes I just feel pressure to do well, and when I don’t, I don't know how to handle it.

Consultant: That makes sense. Feeling pressure can really build up emotions. When you feel that pressure, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I just keep thinking that I have to be perfect. If I mess up, I think everyone will laugh at me.

Consultant: That’s a heavy expectation to carry, thinking you must be perfect. It’s natural to worry about what others think. But is it possible everyone isn’t focused on your mistakes as much as you believe?

User: Maybe, but it just feels like they are. I hate it when I make mistakes; I feel so embarrassed.

Consultant: Embarrassment can be a really strong feeling. Let's try something. If a friend made a mistake, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them it's okay and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone does make mistakes, including you. It’s a part of learning. How do you think you could remind yourself of this when you start feeling that pressure again?

User: I could try to tell myself it’s okay to mess up, maybe like what I would say to a friend.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Practicing self-kindness can really help. When you feel those angry feelings next time, you could also try taking a few deep breaths. Would you like to give it a try together?

User: Okay, I can try that.

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly through your nose... hold it… and now exhale through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming. I think I like it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a simple tool to help you feel a bit less overwhelmed. If you’re feeling upset in class again, you can try stepping away for a moment and using that breathing technique.

User: I think I can do that. I just wish my teachers saw how I feel.

Consultant: It’s important to feel understood. Have you thought about sharing your feelings with your teachers? Sometimes they don’t know what’s going on unless we tell them.

User: I guess I never really thought about that. I’m scared they won’t care.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared about opening up, but many teachers want to help. You could start small by saying, “I’m feeling really overwhelmed sometimes.” Do you think you could give that a shot?

User: Maybe… but I’m still worried they will just tell me to try harder.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Xiao Chen. How about we practice what you might say? You could express not just your worries but also your desire to improve. What do you think?

User: Okay, um… I could say I’m trying my best but sometimes feel scared about making mistakes.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a strong way to express yourself. You deserve to be heard. How do you feel thinking about saying that to your teacher?

User: I feel a little less nervous… but still scared.

Consultant: That’s okay! Feeling nervous is natural, especially when sharing your feelings. Remember, every step you take is progress, and you can do this at your own pace. 

User: Yeah, I want to try. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! Let’s recap what we discussed today. You've learned to recognize your feelings and practice deep breathing when things get intense. You’re also thinking about how to communicate your feelings to your teachers.

User: Yes, I think I can remember that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Before we finish, what do you think you might do differently the next time you feel that pressure in class?

User: I’ll try to breathe and remind myself that it’s okay to mess up.

Consultant: Exactly! I’m really proud of you, Xiao Chen. You have the tools to manage your feelings. Keep practicing, and we can talk about how it went next time.

User: Thanks! I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. This session is a step toward understanding your emotions better. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need support. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, I'm glad you're here today! I know it's been a tough time for you lately with everything that happened at school. Can you share a bit about how you’re feeling right now?

User: Hi. I feel really upset. The teacher was so harsh after the fight. I just don’t understand why I can't control my feelings. I feel like I failed.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel upset, especially after receiving harsh criticism. It sounds like that experience made you feel frustrated and maybe even a bit misunderstood. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during that moment?

User: I just felt really angry. It was a small push, but then it escalated. I didn’t want it to go that far, but I couldn't stop myself.

Consultant: It feels like anger took over in that moment. Often, when we're overwhelmed, it can be hard to think clearly. After you acted out, what emotions came up for you?

User: I felt guilty, but also confused. I thought I was just defending myself, but now I feel like I did something terrible.

Consultant: It's normal to feel conflicted when our actions don't align with our intentions. So, you were trying to protect yourself but ended up feeling like you did something wrong. What do you think might help you when you start feeling that anger again in the future?

User: I don’t know… Maybe if I could just walk away? But in the moment, it’s hard to think about that.

Consultant: Walking away is a great strategy, but as you mentioned, it can be difficult to remember to do it when emotions run high. Would it help to think about some specific steps you could take beforehand to prepare yourself for those moments?

User: Yeah, I guess thinking ahead might be good. I just don’t want to get in trouble again.

Consultant: Absolutely, preparing in advance could help you feel more in control. Perhaps we could kickstart some role-playing exercises? Practicing responses might make it easier for you when you face a similar situation. Would you be willing to try that?

User: Sure, I suppose that might help. I’d like to find a way to handle things better!

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine a scenario where someone pushes your buttons. What do you think the first thing you could say or do might be instead of reacting with anger?

User: Maybe I could just say, “I don’t want to fight,” and then step back?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! By expressing your boundary and stepping away, you give yourself space to cool down. Sometimes, even just saying what you feel can help. If you were to face a situation like this again, how would you remind yourself to say that?

User: I could maybe practice saying it out loud or tell myself to breathe first?

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing those phrases or reminding yourself to breathe can serve as a helpful cue. Deep breathing, in particular, can calm your body when you're feeling angry or upset. Would you like to try a breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, let’s do that. 

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in through the nose... and out through the mouth. Imagine you're releasing all that tension with each breath out. How does that feel?

User: It feels a little better, I guess. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Breathing can really help settle your feelings. Now, when you think about the next time you feel anger coming up, how do you think controlling your breath can support you?

User: I think it might help me calm down enough to think before I act. 

Consultant: Exactly! It creates a gap between your feelings and your actions. You can breathe and remind yourself of your goal to “not fight.” After everything we've discussed today, how do you feel about tackling situations like this in the future?

User: I’m feeling a bit more hopeful. At least I have some ideas to try next time.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re really beginning to understand how to approach those situations differently. Just remember, it's okay to take your time and keep practicing. What will be your first step after today?

User: I’ll practice breathing and saying, “I don’t want to fight.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect a bit on everything we’ve talked about. How do you believe you’ll handle your feelings now moving forward?

User: I think I can handle it better... It feels good to have some ways to stop myself before I react.

Consultant: I'm really proud of the insight you've gained today. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and it's okay to seek help when you need it. If things get tough again, just remind yourself of these strategies. Are you feeling ready to put these new strategies into practice?

User: Yes, I think I am!

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it's all about progress, and every little step counts. I'm here for you, should you need to revisit anything in the future. Take care, and keep practicing those techniques!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session, Xiao Chen. I'm glad to see you here. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I still feel really upset about the fight at school. I don't like that I couldn't control my anger.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel upset about that. It sounds like you are experiencing a mix of frustration and guilt. Can you tell me a bit more about what you were feeling before the fight happened?

User: I was waiting in line, and some kids pushed ahead. I felt so angry and just lost control. Afterward, I felt really bad for hurting my classmate.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Xiao Chen. It sounds like there was a sudden trigger that you didn't expect, which led to strong emotions. Let's explore those feelings. What signs did your body give you before you started to feel angry?

User: My heart was racing, and I felt hot. I was also clenching my fists.

Consultant: Those are important signs to notice. Recognizing these physical cues can help you before anger takes over. Let’s practice identifying those feelings when they start. What could you do next time you feel your heart racing like that?

User: I don't really know… Maybe I could walk away or take a deep breath?

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Taking a moment to breathe can help calm your body and help you think more clearly. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together now?

User: Okay, that sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it. Take a deep breath in for four counts... hold it for four counts... and breathe out slowly for four counts. Let’s repeat that a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming, I guess.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this breathing technique whenever you start to feel those early signs of anger. Now, let's think about the conflict at school. If you were faced with a similar situation again, what do you think might help you handle it differently?

User: Maybe I could talk to them and say it’s not fair instead of fighting?

Consultant: Absolutely! Using your words instead of your fists is a very constructive approach. Let’s practice that together. How would you start the conversation if someone cuts in front of you in line?

User: I could say, “Hey, that’s not nice. Can we take turns?”

Consultant: That’s excellent, Xiao Chen! Expressing your feelings calmly can really help resolve misunderstandings. It's about finding a win-win situation, right? How do you feel about that approach?

User: I like that idea! It sounded nicer than fighting.

Consultant: Yes, it really is. It can help you build better relationships with your classmates too. Now, let’s think about a time when you managed a conflict well. Can you remember an experience where you handled things peacefully?

User: There was a time when we had a disagreement about a game, and instead of getting mad, I just asked if we could play together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! You chose to communicate positively, and it worked out for you. Focusing on those happy moments will help build your confidence in resolving conflicts. What do you think you could say next time to keep that positive momentum going?

User: Maybe I could say, “Let’s find a way to play together,” or something like that.

Consultant: That sounds perfect. You’re already thinking of solutions, which is a big step forward! Now, as we wrap up today, how are you feeling about your ability to handle situations with your classmates in the future?

User: I feel a little more confident, like I could try using my words instead of getting angry.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Chen! You've made great progress today. Remember, it's okay to feel angry at times, but using your words can really help. What will be your first step when you face a conflict?

User: I will try to remember to breathe and talk instead of fighting.

Consultant: That's a great plan! I believe you can do it. I'm here to support you whenever you need. Until next time, keep practicing those skills, and I look forward to hearing about how it goes!

User: Thank you! I'll try my best.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better, I guess. I tried sharing my toys with the other kids in the group activity. It was nice, but I still get nervous talking to them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you shared your toys! It shows you are trying to connect with others. Can you tell me more about how it felt when you shared your toys? 

User: It felt good, but I was worried they wouldn’t like my toys or would laugh at me. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel worried, especially when trying to connect with new friends. What helped you to share your toys in the first place?

User: I saw that a few kids were happy and playing together. I wanted to be part of it, I guess.

Consultant: That makes sense. Wanting to be part of a happy group can be motivating. When you were sharing, did you notice any changes in how the other kids reacted to you?

User: Yes! Some kids smiled at me and said they liked my toys, which made me feel happy. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Their smiles and kind words probably made you feel more accepted. How did that affect your nerves when talking to them?

User: I felt a little less nervous after they smiled. But sometimes I still worry about what they think of me.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to have those worries. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. When you worry about what they think, what are some of the thoughts that come to your mind?

User: I think they might not want to play with me. Or they might think I’m weird.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough. Did you notice if those thoughts changed after the group activities where you shared your toys?

User: A little. I think some kids liked me, but I still worry sometimes.

Consultant: That’s progress, Xiao Chen! You are recognizing that some kids enjoy your company. Can we try to think about those kids who liked you? What evidence do you have that they like you?

User: They played with my toys and smiled. They even invited me to play more.

Consultant: Sounds like you have strong evidence that they enjoy being around you! How can we use this evidence to help reduce some of the worries about being “weird” or unwanted?

User: I guess I could remind myself that smiling means they like me.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a great strategy. You can add that to your toolbox for when those worries come up again. How does thinking of that make you feel now?

User: It makes me feel a little better. I think I can try to remember that next time.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for working through this. What new steps do you feel ready to take in your next group activities?

User: Maybe I can talk more with the kids and even ask them to play games together.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Xiao Chen! Being proactive can help create more positive interactions. What kinds of games do you think you can ask them to join you in?

User: I really like playing with blocks. I could ask them to build towers together.

Consultant: Building towers sounds like a fun idea! It encourages teamwork too. How do you think that will feel for you?

User: I think I will feel happy, and it might be less scary to talk to them while we play.

Consultant: Yes, playing often eases communication. If you ever feel nervous, remember to use the evidence you’ve gathered, about how they enjoy your company. Would you like to make a plan for when you feel worried next time?

User: Yeah, I think that would help!

Consultant: Great! You can remind yourself that you’ve had positive interactions before and use your friendly smiles to guide your conversations. Can we practice a few phrases you might say when you want to start playing with them?

User: Sure! I can say, "Do you want to help me build a tower?"

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a friendly, open invitation. It shows your interest in playing together. Do you feel more confident about this now?

User: Yes, I do! 

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that! As we continue to solidify these skills, staying curious and open to others will be very helpful. What other areas would you like to discuss in our sessions next time?

User: I think I'd like to keep improving how I talk to my classmates.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can focus on that together! I’m really proud of the progress you've made today. Remember, building positive relationships takes time. Keep using your evidence and the strategies we discussed. 

User: Thank you! I feel better talking about it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Chen! It’s been a pleasure to chat with you. You’re doing such a wonderful job. I look forward to our next session and hearing about your experiences!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I joined a team game in class, and it was really fun. I think I like working with others more now.

Consultant: That sounds great! I'm happy to hear you enjoyed the game and felt positive about working with your classmates. Can you tell me more about what you liked about that experience?

User: Well, everyone was cheering, and it felt nice to be part of a team. I didn't feel as nervous as before. 

Consultant: Being part of a supportive team can really help with those feelings of nervousness. What do you think helped you feel more relaxed this time?

User: Maybe because I wasn't worried about making mistakes. Everyone was just having fun together.

Consultant: It seems like allowing yourself to focus on the fun rather than worrying about mistakes helped you enjoy the experience. How do you feel about participating in more activities like this?

User: I want to try! I think it would be cool to join other games too.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiao Chen! Trying new activities can help you build more confidence and connections with your classmates. Do you have any events or games in mind that you would like to join?

User: There’s a class project coming up, and I think I might want to work with a group on it.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic opportunity! Working with a group on the project can be a great way to continue building those teamwork skills. What do you think will be the most exciting part of working with others on that project?

User: I guess I’ll get to share my ideas and hear theirs too. It feels good to work together!

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing ideas and collaborating can make the project much more enjoyable. Have you thought about any potential challenges you might face while working in a group?

User: I’m a bit scared that I might not know what to say, or if they don’t like my ideas.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel worried about expressing your ideas. How do you think you could handle those feelings if they come up during the project?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that everyone’s opinion matters, and I should just try to be brave.

Consultant: That's a great approach, Xiao Chen! Remembering that every voice is important can help you feel more comfortable sharing your thoughts. What’s one thing you could tell yourself to boost your confidence if you start to feel nervous?

User: I could say, “It’s okay to share, and they might like my ideas.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mantra! Saying positive things to yourself can really help. How have your feelings been at home recently? Has there been a change since you are feeling better at school?

User: My mom seemed happier after I told her about the game. We’ve been talking a bit more.

Consultant: It's nice to hear that you've been able to connect more with your mom. Building those positive conversations at home can make a big difference. How do you feel when you talk about your experiences with her?

User: I feel good! She listens and smiles, which makes me feel like she cares.

Consultant: That’s very important. When you feel cared for, it can help you be more open and share even more. What would you like to talk about with your mom next time?

User: I want to tell her about the project and see if she has any ideas too.

Consultant: That's a great initiative! Involving her can help strengthen your connection. Let’s think about how you can keep applying what you’ve learned in social situations. What behaviors do you think you can use to ensure you keep building those connections at school?

User: I can keep joining activities and talk to my classmates more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping active and communicating with your classmates will help develop those skills further. Are there any particular activities you want to participate in next?

User: I want to try out for the school play. I think it could be fun to act with others.

Consultant: That sounds like an exciting opportunity! Auditioning for a play could be a great way to express yourself and work as part of a team. What do you think might be a challenge during the audition?

User: I might be nervous in front of the judge. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous. How could you prepare to feel more comfortable during the audition?

User: I can practice my lines at home and maybe do it in front of my family first.

Consultant: Practicing in front of your family is an excellent idea! It can help make you feel more confident. I'm really proud of the progress you've made. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you can keep using these new skills. 

User: I learned that having fun can help me work with others, and I can talk to my mom about my school activities too. 

Consultant: Exactly! Remember to keep aiming for those positive experiences and talking about them with your family. You’re building a great foundation for yourself. If you encounter any bumps along the road, don't hesitate to reach out for help. This is a journey, and you’re doing really well.

User: Thank you! I feel happy about what I can do now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Chen! I'm excited to see how you continue to grow and flourish. If you need anything, I'm just a conversation away. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! I’m really glad to see you today. To start off, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I’ve been feeling a bit better. I’m more open to joining in activities at school, and I’m not getting as upset as before. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're becoming more confident and able to manage your emotions better. Can you share a specific moment when you felt this change?

User: Well, during recess, I joined my classmates in a game instead of sitting alone. I felt happy to play together, and it was nice not to feel angry.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really positive experience for you. Feeling happy while playing with friends is a wonderful sign of progress. Have there been any challenges while making these changes?

User: Sometimes, I still feel a bit anxious when I have to talk in front of the class. I worry about what others might think of me.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about speaking in front of others. Let's explore those feelings further. What specific thoughts cross your mind when you feel anxious about speaking?

User: I think they might laugh at me or think I’m not good enough. I get scared and want to just stay quiet.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiao Chen. These thoughts can be very powerful. Do you think there's any evidence that supports these fears, or might there be other ways to view the situation?

User: I guess I haven't really had anyone laugh at me before. It’s just what I worry about, I suppose.

Consultant: That's an important realization. It seems like your fears might not have a strong basis in reality. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they should give it a try and that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! It's helpful to be kind to yourself like you would with a friend. Now, let's think about some strategies to help you feel more confident when speaking in front of the class. Are there small steps we could take together?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking in front of my family first. That could help a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Practicing in a safe environment can build your confidence. How do you feel about sharing something you’re interested in with your family as practice?

User: I could talk about my favorite game. I think they would like that!

Consultant: That sounds perfect, Xiao Chen! Sharing something you love can make it easier. How do you think you will feel after practicing this with them?

User: I think I might feel more ready for class. If they like it, I might feel more confident.

Consultant: Definitely! Feeling supported by your family will help boost your confidence. Is there anything else we can review today to ensure you’re feeling supported both at home and at school?

User: Actually, I want to make sure my parents understand I need them to listen to me more when I feel upset.

Consultant: That’s a valuable request, Xiao Chen. Open communication is so important. We can work on ways for you to express this need to your parents. How about writing a little note or talking to them calmly when you feel ready?

User: I think I can try to write a note. That seems easier than saying it all at once.

Consultant: Writing can definitely be a great first step! You can express your feelings in a clear and thoughtful way. After that, we can check in again. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel pretty good. I think I’m getting better at handling things.

Consultant: I’m proud of you! You’ve made wonderful progress. Just remember, it's okay to feel anxious sometimes, but you have the tools to manage those feelings. In our next session, we can see how your practice went and talk more about communication with your parents.

User: That sounds good! Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Chen! Keep up your great work, and I’ll look forward to hearing all about it next time. Take care until then!
