Consultant: Hi there, Rui Rui! Thanks for joining me today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your family situation?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel really lonely and abandoned. Ever since my dad got remarried and had a new baby, it feels like I don't matter anymore. I just can't seem to talk to my dad without feeling tense.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like the changes in your family have made you feel quite hurt and distant from your dad. Let’s dive a bit deeper. Can you tell me what specific thoughts you have when you feel that way?

User: I keep thinking that my dad doesn't care about me anymore, and that I’m just not important to him. I get so frustrated when I think about how things used to be between us.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel unimportant and that your dad's focus has shifted. It’s understandable to feel that way with such significant changes. Do you think there might be any other explanations for your dad's behavior that could help you view the situation differently?

User: I guess maybe he has a lot on his plate with the new baby, but it still hurts. I can't help but feel like he's chosen them over me.

Consultant: That’s a really valid feeling, Rui Rui. You’re dealing with a lot of changes, and it’s common to feel pushed aside. Let’s consider this: If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would probably tell them that their dad still loves them, even if things are different. But it’s hard for me to see it that way for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Sometimes, our own situations can cloud our perspective. What if we try to explore some ways you can express your feelings to your dad? How could you bring this up with him?

User: I’m not sure. I feel like he might just get defensive, especially if I tell him I feel abandoned.

Consultant: That’s understandable—it can be challenging to predict someone’s reaction, especially with such sensitive topics. What if we practice how you could express your feelings in a way that might invite a more open conversation? 

User: Yeah, that could help. But I don’t want to sound like I’m blaming him.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on expressing your feelings rather than placing blame can shift the conversation positively. You might say something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit lost since the changes in our family, and I’d love to talk about it with you.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay, but I worry he won't understand.

Consultant: It’s perfectly fine to have that worry. Open communication is a process. Perhaps we can brainstorm more ways to approach it together. What are some positive things your dad might respond to? 

User: Well, he does care about my basketball. Maybe if I start there, it could open up the conversation.

Consultant: Great idea! Connecting through shared interests can be a good way to break the ice. You could mention how basketball has been something you love and segue into discussing how you feel. Would that feel comfortable for you?

User: I think so. It definitely feels less confrontational that way.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. What else do you think could help you during this transition? 

User: I guess having some space to vent my feelings when I get overwhelmed could really help. 

Consultant: Venting can be a healthy way to manage emotions. Perhaps we can create some sort of outlet for you, like journaling or talking with someone you trust. What do you think?

User: Journaling could be good. I could write things down without worrying about someone judging me.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Writing can be very therapeutic and a safe space to explore your feelings. If you had a moment to think about it, what kinds of things would you want to write about?

User: I’d probably write about how I feel about my dad and the new family. And maybe about missing the time we used to spend together.

Consultant: Those are significant topics. Reflecting on your emotions is crucial for understanding them better. As you write, you might discover more about your feelings. Can we try to set a target for you to write this week?

User: Yeah, I could try writing a couple of times this week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! I believe that can help you feel clearer about your emotions. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the conversation we’ve had?

User: I feel a bit better now. It's nice to have someone to talk to about this stuff. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Rui Rui. Remember, it's entirely okay to feel what you feel, and taking these small steps can lead to a better understanding of yourself and your relationship with your dad. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Just remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take your time. I look forward to hearing how things go next time. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Rui Rui! It's great to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling recently? What’s on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down, especially about my dad. I just can't shake the feeling that he doesn't love me anymore since he remarried. It's really bothering me.

Consultant: I hear you—those feelings can be really overwhelming. It sounds like you're struggling with your relationship with your dad and how his new family has changed things. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel that way?

User: Well, I just notice that he seems so happy with my stepmother and their baby. I feel like I'm being left out or forgotten. It hurts.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, Rui Rui. It’s understandable to feel left out when there’s such a big change in your family dynamic. How do you think these feelings are affecting your day-to-day life, especially with school and your friends?

User: It's hard to focus on school. My grades are slipping, and I feel really sad during classes. I just can't concentrate. It feels like nothing matters anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like the emotional weight you're carrying is impacting your studies and enjoyment at school. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling this way, especially in relation to your dad or his new family?

User: Yeah, I keep thinking that if he really loved me, he wouldn't have moved on so quickly. I feel like I’m not important to him anymore.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry, Rui Rui. It seems like you're feeling a sense of rejection, which is completely valid. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your dad doesn’t care about you anymore?

User: Well, he spends more time with them and shows a lot of love for the baby. But then I only see him on weekends. It's like he’s made a new family without me.

Consultant: It makes sense that seeing your dad express love to his new family would fuel those thoughts. Sometimes, feelings can distort our perception. What if we tried to consider other perspectives? Do you think your dad might still care for you in his own way?

User: I don’t know. Sometimes I think he might, but I can’t help feeling jealous and upset.

Consultant: That’s a completely normal reaction, too. Jealousy often stems from feeling insecure about our own relationships. If you were to step back, what are some of the ways your dad might show he still values you, even if they’re not as visible?

User: Maybe he tries to reach out when we talk. But I often just focus on how great everything is with the new family.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It sounds like sometimes you’re missing the signs of connection he offers. Could you think of some positive interactions you've had with your dad, even recently?

User: Well, he did take me out for burgers last week. But then I just felt sad afterward thinking about how it used to be.

Consultant: It’s great that you had that time together! It’s okay to feel sadness about the past while also recognizing the moments of connection you still have. What would it look like to focus on those positive moments rather than just what you perceive as a loss?

User: I guess I could try to appreciate the times we do have together instead of just thinking about what’s missing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the present and those positive interactions could help you feel more connected to him. It might also help to practice gratitude for those moments. What are a few things about your dad you can be grateful for?

User: He has always been supportive when I have basketball games, I guess. And he listens to me sometimes.

Consultant: Those are wonderful things to appreciate! Acknowledging his support and listening can help balance out some of the negative feelings. How do you feel about starting a gratitude practice? Maybe jotting down those positive aspects whenever you notice them?

User: That sounds interesting. I could do that. It might help me feel better about everything.

Consultant: I think that could be really beneficial! As you notice these positive aspects, it can create a shift in how you view your relationship with him. Moving forward, if feelings of sadness come up, how might you use those gratitude moments to cope?

User: Maybe I could read what I’ve written and remind myself that he does care about me.

Consultant: Exactly! Using your gratitude notes could serve as a powerful reminder for you. Change takes time, and it's okay to still feel mixed emotions. Are there any other strategies or support systems in your life that can help you navigate through these feelings?

User: Well, I have friends I can talk to, but sometimes I feel they wouldn’t understand.

Consultant: It can feel isolating to keep emotions bottled up; however, sharing with friends who care can be a comfort. What if you give them a chance and see if they can support you? You might be surprised at their understanding.

User: That might help. I’ll try to open up a little bit more next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step, Rui Rui! Opening up can really lighten the emotional load. Remember, it’s okay to feel the way you do, and taking those small steps can lead to meaningful changes.

User: Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for talking through this with me. I feel a bit lighter now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing and exploring these feelings can certainly help. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what we discussed today and how you can use these strategies moving forward. 

User: Sure! I think focusing on gratitude and talking more with friends will really help me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It’s been great working with you on this. Remember, it’s okay to reach out whenever you’re feeling overwhelmed. You’re making progress, and I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Rui Rui! I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rui Rui! It's great to see you today. I want to support you in managing the pressures you're facing at school and at home. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been really stressed. My grades dropped during the midterms, and my dad was pretty upset about it. It makes me feel overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to deal with it.

Consultant: I hear you, it sounds really tough. Balancing school pressure and family expectations can be very challenging. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when your dad criticized you?

User: I felt really disappointed in myself, and I think my dad expects so much from me. It's like no matter how hard I try, I can't meet his expectations, and it’s stressing me out even more.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable to feel disappointed when you think you’re not living up to expectations. Let's explore how these thoughts affect your emotions. When you think about your dad's high expectations, what feelings come up for you?

User: I feel anxious and sad. Sometimes I think he wouldn't care if I just gave up. I want to make him proud, but I feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anxiety and sadness, which is quite normal in this situation. Can we identify those feelings? When you experience anxiety, what thoughts are happening at that moment?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough and that I’ll never improve. I feel like everyone else is doing better than I am.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very intense. Let’s take a closer look at that thinking. You mentioned feeling like you’re not good enough—what kind of evidence do you have to support that thought?

User: Well, my exam results weren't good, and my dad keeps telling me that I need to try harder. It makes me feel like I’m failing not just in studies but also as a son.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel judged based on your grades, but I wonder if there might be other explanations. If a friend was in your situation, what would you tell them about their worth beyond their grades?

User: I’d probably tell them that grades aren’t everything and that everyone has their ups and downs. But it’s hard to think that way for myself.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows you recognize that grades don’t define all of who we are. Let’s challenge that thought together. Is it possible there are other strengths you have, like your basketball skills or writing? 

User: I do like basketball, and I feel good when I’m playing. But it still feels like my studies are more important to everyone else.

Consultant: It’s great that you have that joy in basketball! What if we could create a plan where you include your passions, like basketball, as part of your routine to help balance the pressure? How might that feel?

User: That might help! If I could set aside time for basketball, it could relieve some pressure. But what if my grades drop even more?

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about that, but remember, balancing activities can actually improve your focus and motivation for studying. How about we create a small plan where you can set specific study goals alongside your basketball practice? 

User: I think I could try that. Maybe I can aim to study for an hour and then play basketball for a while. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting specific goals can give you a sense of accomplishment. Do you feel comfortable with adding a breathing or mindfulness exercise to help manage any anxiety during your study times?

User: I’ve heard of mindfulness, but I’m not sure how it works.

Consultant: Mindfulness is about being present and noticing your thoughts without judgment. For example, taking a few moments to breathe deeply can calm your mind before you study. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose... and slowly exhale through your mouth… Let's do that a couple of times. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. I think I can try that before studying.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Regular practice can really help your anxiety. As we continue, what steps do you think you can take to maintain this balance between your studies and your interests?

User: I’ll aim to stick to my study plan and make sure I play basketball regularly. That should help my mood.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! You are actively taking steps to manage your feelings and pressures. How do you think this might change your relationship with your dad?

User: It might help! If I’m calmer and more balanced, maybe I won’t get into arguments with him as often.

Consultant: Absolutely! Better emotional management can lead to more productive conversations with him. What will be your next step after today’s session to ensure you keep this balance?

User: I’ll write down my plan and try to start it tomorrow. Playing basketball is important for me, so I want to make sure I prioritize that.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Prioritizing activities that bring joy is key to maintaining balance. Before we finish today, how are you feeling about managing these pressures now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think with a plan in place and using mindfulness, I can handle things better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’re feeling hopeful! You have the tools to make a positive change. As we wrap up today, remember that it's perfectly okay to seek support from your family or friends too. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I think it was helpful! I appreciate your help with finding ways to cope.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and being open today, Rui Rui. You’ve made great progress. Keep in mind the ideas we discussed, and you can always reach out if you need more support. I’m here for you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rui Rui! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had some meaningful experiences with your basketball team. Can you tell me more about how that has made you feel lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, being part of the team has been really great. I feel like I belong somewhere, and it helps me forget about some of the family stuff. But sometimes, I still feel kind of lonely at home.

Consultant: It sounds like being with your team provides you with a sense of belonging, which is wonderful. However, feeling lonely at home can be tough. Can you share what makes you feel lonely when you're with your family?

User: Well, my dad and I don’t really talk much. It's awkward. And when I'm home, I just think about basketball or my friends instead of my family.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to focus on things that make you feel good, like basketball and friends, especially when there’s tension at home. What do you think you could do to help improve communication with your dad?

User: I don't know. I guess I could try to talk to him more, but it feels weird. He’s really busy with work and doesn’t seem to care much about what I’m doing.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Feeling that your dad is busy and not as engaged can create a sense of distance. What do you think your dad might feel or think about when you share your achievements in basketball with him?

User: Maybe he’d be proud? He used to come to my games but hasn’t recently. I just feel like he’s focused on other things now.

Consultant: It’s possible he would feel proud, and sharing your successes could open up a conversation. It might also show him that you want to connect with him. How do you think that could change things between you two?

User: I guess it might help. I really want him to see that I’m doing well and that I’m working hard. It’s just hard to start talking.

Consultant: Starting that conversation can indeed be difficult. What if we role-play how you could bring up a recent game or your team's success with him? This way, you can practice the conversation.

User: That could be helpful. Okay, let’s try it.

Consultant: Great! I’ll be your dad. Just share your excitement about your last game, as if I’m him. Go ahead!

User: Hi, Dad. We played a basketball match last week, and we won! It was such a great team effort!

Consultant: That sounds exciting! How did you feel during the game?

User: I felt really happy because my teammates were so supportive. It felt like we were all in it together, and I scored some points too.

Consultant: That’s awesome! It’s clear you’re passionate about basketball. What else could you tell me about it?

User: Hmm, I could mention that I was nervous at first, but my teammates helped me feel more confident. It was nice to know they were there for me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing that you felt nervous but received support could help him understand your experiences better. How does that feel to express this to him?

User: It feels good! I think he’d get to see that it means a lot to me. Maybe he’d want to come watch a game again.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging him with your feelings could pave the way for better communication. Now, what do you think you can do to keep this positive momentum going with your dad?

User: I could invite him to my next game and let him know how much it would mean to me if he came. That might open up more conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Inviting him could spark more interaction. How do you feel about trying this?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I think it could work. 

Consultant: Your excitement is wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Taking this step could significantly change your relationship with your dad. What’s your biggest takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I think I learned that sharing my feelings and experiences can help connect with my dad. I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Rui Rui! It’s all about building those connections, and you’re already on the right path. I believe you can make this happen. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel better and more hopeful now. I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've been very open today, and that’s a big step. Remember, communication is a skill that gets easier with practice. If you ever feel the need to talk again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely reach out if I need help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Rui Rui! I look forward to hearing how things go. Take care, and good luck with your upcoming game! 

User: Thanks! I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rui Rui! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke about your accomplishment in the calligraphy competition?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Winning that prize made me happy, and my grandfather was really proud. My father even praised me genuinely for the first time in a while.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that your victory brought some positive moments with your family. How did it feel for you to receive that praise from your father?

User: It actually felt nice. I wasn’t expecting him to say anything at all, but his acknowledgment made me feel seen and appreciated.

Consultant: Feeling recognized by your father can be quite impactful, especially given the tension between you two. How do you think this experience might influence your relationship with him moving forward?

User: I think it might help me be more open. Since he was supportive this time, I feel like he can be that way more often. I want to try to communicate better.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Rui Rui! It's encouraging to hear you want to improve communication. What are some ways you think you could start that conversation with him?

User: Maybe I can talk to him about my passion for calligraphy. He doesn’t really know much about what I do or what I like.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea! Sharing your interests can open up dialogue and foster a deeper connection. What would it look like for you to share your passion with your father?

User: I could show him some of my recent pieces or even invite him to watch me practice. I guess showing him a part of my world might help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! By inviting him in, you’re not just sharing your achievements but also allowing him to see your creativity. How do you feel about taking that first step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think he might surprise me again with his reaction, like he did when he complimented me.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about that. Trying something new can be a bit daunting. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about his potential reaction?

User: I just hope he doesn’t brush it off or act disinterested. I want it to be a positive moment between us.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like you’re wishing for a positive interaction, and your hopes are valid. If he doesn’t react the way you expect, how might you handle that situation?

User: I guess I’ll try to remind myself that not everyone expresses interest the same way. Maybe I shouldn’t take it too personally?

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Remembering that different people have different ways of showing support can help you manage your expectations. Now, apart from sharing your calligraphy, is there anything else you might want to discuss with your father?

User: Maybe I could also talk to him about basketball. I’ve been practicing a lot, and I feel like he might be interested in that too.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging him with something you’re passionate about could indeed open more avenues for conversation. How do you feel about combining both interests in your discussions?

User: I like that idea. It feels more natural to talk about different things. I can show him my calligraphy and then tell him about basketball practice.

Consultant: That’s a lovely combination! This way, you’re allowing for a more holistic view of who you are. How do you think discussing these interests might change your father’s perception of you?

User: I think he might realize that I have my own achievements and hobbies. Maybe he’ll want to support me more after seeing what I’m doing.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s an excellent opportunity for him to see you beyond just being his son. As you prepare for this, what positive affirmations can you remind yourself of when you approach these conversations?

User: I could tell myself that I’m doing my best and that it’s okay to have these conversations. Connecting with him is important to me.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Rui Rui! Focusing on connection is key. Remember that you’re taking steps toward strengthening your relationship. How do you envision your relationship with your father in the near future?

User: I hope it gets warmer. I want us to have more moments of understanding and support. It would mean a lot to me.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful wish, and it seems very attainable with your willingness to engage more. Let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed today. You’re ready to share your achievements and build that connection. How does that plan make you feel overall?

User: I feel more confident and motivated. I think I can do this, and I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As we wrap up today’s session, it sounds like you’re making great strides in your relationship with your father. Remember, communication is key, and you have the tools to foster a stronger bond. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your encouragement and guidance. I’ll keep you posted on how it goes.

Consultant: Please do! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress and how these conversations unfold. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rui Rui! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling better, actually. I think participating in the parent day with my dad helped a lot. I felt a bit of his support, which was nice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the parent day was a positive experience for you. What specifically made you feel supported during that time?

User: My dad actually seemed proud of me while we were talking with the teachers. It was the first time I saw him like that in a long while.

Consultant: It must have felt good to see that pride in him. How has this change in your dad’s attitude affected your feelings towards him?

User: I think I’m starting to see him differently. I used to feel kind of angry and distant, but now I see he does care about me in his own way.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in perspective, Rui Rui. Recognizing that your dad cares can be really powerful for rebuilding your relationship. How would you like to continue improving your connection with him?

User: I’d like to talk to him more often, even about little things, to keep that connection going.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Regular communication can really help strengthen your bond. What kind of topics do you think you would want to discuss with him?

User: Maybe I can share more about my basketball practice or school projects. Also, asking him about his interests could help too.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent conversation starters! Sharing your interests and asking about his can foster a sense of closeness. How do you feel about initiating these conversations?

User: I’m a bit nervous about it. I don’t want to bring up anything too heavy or make it awkward.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when trying to connect. It could help to approach it in a casual way. You might start with light topics and gradually build up to more personal discussions. How does that sound?

User: That does sound manageable. I think starting light could ease the tension.

Consultant: Exactly! Starting with topics you both enjoy can create a comfortable environment for deeper conversations later on. Do you have any specific ways you plan to bring these topics up?

User: Maybe I can text him after practice to ask if he wants to hear about my day?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! A simple text can be a friendly way to engage him. It shows you're reaching out without pressure. What are your expectations for these discussions?

User: I hope they’ll make him feel involved in my life more, and maybe it’ll help us bond even more.

Consultant: That's a beautiful goal! Building that involvement can strengthen your relationship. Have you thought about how you might handle it if the conversation doesn’t flow as you hope?

User: I guess I could just keep things light and try not to force anything. If it doesn’t work out, it’s okay.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset to have. Allowing space for the conversation to grow naturally will help reduce that pressure. Reflecting on your dad's responses can also open more discussion avenues. How do you feel about managing your expectations?

User: I think understanding that it’s a process helps a lot. I just want to keep trying.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping an open mindset about the process is key. It's about the journey, not just the results. As you practice communicating, you’ll likely notice changes over time. How else can I support you in this goal?

User: I think just keeping these conversation ideas in mind is helpful. If I get nervous, I’ll remind myself what we talked about.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Practice makes it easier over time. Would you also like to discuss any barriers or fears you might have when approaching your dad?

User: Well, I sometimes worry he might not be interested or too busy with work.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s important to recognize his commitments. You might consider asking him when he has some time to talk. If he's busy, it might show him you're aware of his schedule and are willing to find a good time. Would that work?

User: Yes, that sounds respectful. I can definitely ask him when he's free.

Consultant: Great choice! Being considerate of his time can deepen your understanding of one another. How do you feel about this approach overall?

User: I feel more optimistic now. It’s nice to have a plan instead of just wondering.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Having a plan can give you a sense of direction. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is the most important takeaway for you?

User: I think it’s about keeping the conversation open and relaxed. I can start slowly to build our connection.

Consultant: Exactly, Rui Rui! This is a step-by-step journey. I'm proud of you for your willingness to strengthen your bond with your dad. If you ever feel uncertain, remember that it’s okay to seek support anytime. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the advice. I'll definitely try to keep this positive mindset.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Your commitment to improving your relationship is commendable. I believe you can manage this. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to return. 

User: I will! Thanks again for everything.

Consultant: Take care, Rui Rui! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
