Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. I want to create a safe space where we can talk about how you've been feeling. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious and lost ever since I was hospitalized for schizophrenia. It makes me worry about how it might affect my studies and future.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious, especially with everything you're going through. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your studies and future are concerning you the most?

User: I’m worried I won’t be able to catch up with my classmates. Sometimes I feel like they are moving forward while I'm stuck here in the hospital.

Consultant: That feeling of being left behind can be really tough. It might help to explore what specific thoughts you have about your classmates and your ability to keep up. What comes to your mind when you think about them?

User: I keep thinking that they must be so disappointed in me or that they think I’m not trying hard enough. I feel like I've let everyone down.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. It’s important to recognize that these thoughts can often feel more intense than the reality. Do you think there’s any evidence supporting those thoughts about how your classmates view you?

User: No, I guess they haven’t actually said anything like that. It’s just how I feel inside.

Consultant: It’s really insightful that you’ve noticed that. Those feelings can be powerful, but they don't always reflect the truth. What do you think your friends or classmates would say if you opened up to them about how you're feeling?

User: I think they would probably be supportive. They've always been nice to me. 

Consultant: That’s a positive thought! Sometimes, sharing our struggles can bring us closer to others. How does it make you feel when you think about the possibility of sharing your feelings with them?

User: It feels a bit scary, to be honest. But also comforting to think they might understand.

Consultant: That’s totally okay to feel both scared and comforted; your feelings are valid. It's a big step to consider reaching out. Besides your classmates, are there others in your life who you think would be supportive during this time?

User: My grandparents are really supportive. They always try to help me when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having supportive family members can make a huge difference. How do they help you when you’re feeling this way?

User: They talk to me and tell me that it’s okay to take my time to get better. They also remind me that my health is the most important thing right now.

Consultant: It sounds like they provide you with a lot of love and reassurance, which is incredibly important. Understanding that your health comes first can help ease some of that pressure. What steps do you think you could take to balance your recovery and your studies?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself? Just to keep moving forward, even if it’s slow.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Setting small, achievable goals can help you feel a sense of progress without overwhelming you. What’s one small goal you might want to start with?

User: I think I could try to read for a little bit each day, even if it’s just a few pages.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Reading a little each day helps keep your mind engaged without putting too much pressure on yourself. How do you feel about starting this habit?

User: I feel hopeful. It gives me something to look forward to, even while I’m in here.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Hope is such a powerful feeling. As you work through your recovery, it might also help to remind yourself that this is a journey and it’s okay to take it at your own pace. How does that resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I guess I need to be kinder to myself during this time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion is key, especially when facing challenges. What would you say to a friend in your position? 

User: I would tell them it’s okay to take a break and focus on their health without feeling guilty.

Consultant: That’s a loving and supportive message. It can be helpful to treat yourself with that same kindness. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to remember from our conversation?

User: To be more gentle with myself and to take things one step at a time. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it's okay to seek support when you need it. I'm here for you, and I look forward to continuing our conversations. Take care, Wang.

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lonely and isolated in the hospital. It's tough not being able to connect with people outside. I’m trying to stay positive, but it really feels overwhelming at times.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially after losing contact with the outside world. Can you share a bit more about the specific situations where you felt this isolation?

User: Well, I can't see my friends or participate in campus activities like I used to. I miss having conversations and just being around people. It makes me feel like I've lost a part of my life.

Consultant: It must be tough to feel like you've lost that part of your life. You mentioned trying to stay positive; what are some ways you've been attempting to connect with others while in the hospital?

User: I've been trying to talk to the nurses and other patients, but it hasn’t been the same. I miss my friends who understand me and can provide real support.

Consultant: It's great that you're reaching out to the nurses and fellow patients. Building connections, even in small ways, can help alleviate feelings of isolation. Have you considered any formal programs or groups that might help create those supportive connections?

User: I think there might be some kind of group activities here, but I feel nervous about joining. I'm worried I won't fit in or be able to connect with others.

Consultant: I completely understand your concerns about fitting in and connecting with others. Those feelings are quite normal. What if we explored what would make you feel more comfortable joining a group activity? 

User: I guess if I knew the type of people who would be there, I might feel less anxious about it. But I still worry about what to say or how to start a conversation.

Consultant: That’s a good point. Knowing what to expect can ease your anxiety. Sometimes it can help to prepare a few topics or questions in advance. If you met someone in that group, what kind of questions do you think you might ask to start a conversation?

User: Maybe I could ask them about their interests or how they’re coping with being here. That might give me something to work with.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Asking about interests is a wonderful way to find common ground. It also shows you care about their experiences. Would you feel more confident if we practiced some of these conversation starters together?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I want to feel more comfortable talking to people.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a bit. Imagine I’m a fellow patient, and you want to introduce yourself. How would you start the conversation?

User: Um, I’d probably say, "Hi, I’m Wang. How long have you been here?" 

Consultant: That's a solid opening! It’s friendly and invites the other person to share about themselves. How do you feel after saying that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also relieved to have a way to start talking.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal! It's about taking one step at a time. Remember, most people appreciate someone initiating a conversation. What kind of support do you think you need to help you take that step?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to feel a bit anxious, and to focus on the potential for connection rather than my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable perspective to carry with you. It’s important to recognize those feelings while also focusing on the positives that connection can bring. Do you think you’d like to set a goal for yourself regarding joining a group or starting conversations this week?

User: I think I’d like to aim to join at least one group activity and introduce myself to someone there.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Joining one activity and introducing yourself is a proactive step forward. How will you keep track of this goal so you can celebrate your accomplishments?

User: I could write it down in my journal. That way, I can see my progress and remind myself of my goals.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing it down not only keeps you accountable but also allows you to reflect on your journey. Have you thought about what you might do to celebrate once you achieve that goal?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a nice snack or a favorite book afterward. It would be nice to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful reward to celebrate your efforts! It’s important to acknowledge and honor your steps, no matter how small they may seem. How would you feel about reflecting on that experience after you’ve completed it?

User: I think reflecting on it would help me understand how I felt and what I could do next. It’s encouraging to think about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection can provide valuable insights and reinforce your progress. As we wrap up today, remember that you're taking important steps towards building those connections. 

User: Thank you, I feel a bit more hopeful about this now. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Wang! You've made significant progress just by talking about these steps. Keep nurturing that hope, and we can continue to build on it in our next session. 

User: Yes, I look forward to it. Thank you again!

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care and remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate this journey. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you again for this session. Before we dive in, can you tell me how you've been feeling lately, especially with the increase in your responsibilities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of pressure and achievement. I have this newfound responsibility at work and in social activities, which makes me feel stressed but also accomplished. I hope to learn ways to handle this pressure better without losing the social connections I've built.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re facing challenges but also finding fulfillment in what you're doing. That's great to hear! Can you share more about what specific situations have made you feel pressured recently?

User: Well, balancing my part-time job with my studies and social life is a lot. I feel like I have to keep up with everything, and sometimes I worry that I might not meet everyone’s expectations.

Consultant: It can be overwhelming to juggle so many responsibilities at once. Let’s explore those thoughts about expectations a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel like you might not meet those expectations?

User: I often think that if I fail, I’ll disappoint my coworkers and friends, which makes me feel really anxious. Sometimes, I even think they might think less of me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy, and I can understand why they would increase your anxiety. Let’s examine those feelings more closely. What evidence do you have that your coworkers and friends would think less of you if you didn’t meet those expectations?

User: I guess I don't have solid proof. It's just a feeling I have. They usually seem supportive. But I fear that if I make a mistake, they might change their opinions about me.

Consultant: It's reassuring to hear that they seem supportive. It’s understandable to fear judgment, but it’s also important to challenge those negative beliefs. How would you respond to a friend who shared the same concerns with you?

User: I would tell them that nobody is perfect and that everyone makes mistakes. I'd probably say they should focus on their efforts rather than the outcomes.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate response! Now, let’s try applying that same kindness to yourself. Instead of focusing on a potential mistake, what if you shifted your perspective to appreciate your efforts and progress instead?

User: That does sound more positive. I think if I could remind myself of my efforts, I might feel less pressured about making mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's create a plan where you can track your efforts and achievements, no matter how small. This could serve as a reminder of your progress rather than just focusing on potential failures. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really helpful! I think writing it down would give me something concrete to refer back to when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Great! Keeping an emotions journal can really help you understand your emotional patterns and create a more balanced perspective. Let’s set some goals for tracking your emotions and efforts. How about committing to writing in your journal daily or every few days?

User: I can definitely try that. I think writing regularly would help me process my thoughts better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! In addition to tracking your emotions, let’s also talk about some activities that bring you joy. Engaging in things you love can significantly reduce stress. What activities make you feel good?

User: I enjoy painting and hanging out with my friends. Those activities help me relax.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Let's make sure to schedule time for those activities regularly so they become a priority in your life. How can you incorporate painting and socializing into your routine this week?

User: I could set a goal to paint at least once this week and maybe plan a small get-together with friends. That would be nice!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Balancing responsibilities with things that bring you joy is crucial for maintaining your mental health. As we wrap up, let’s summarize your commitments: tracking your emotions, challenging negative thoughts, and setting aside time for painting and socializing. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel more motivated to apply these strategies.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Keep in mind that it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. Remember to lean on your support system whenever you need to. How do you feel about moving forward with these strategies?

User: I feel hopeful! I think these changes will help me manage my stress and maintain my friendships.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Wang! As we conclude, what are you most proud of in this process so far?

User: I’m proud of recognizing my own needs and wanting to take steps to care for myself better. 

Consultant: That's a significant realization! You have taken control and made valuable commitments for your well-being. If any challenges arise, know that you have the tools to manage them. Remember that I'm here to support you whenever needed. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and feeling supported through this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been great working with you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out in the future! 

User: I will! Thank you again.

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty good overall. I’ve been enjoying my time in the interest groups at school and making new friends. But I can’t shake off the worry about my condition. Sometimes, I fear that it might affect my friendships.

Consultant: It sounds like you're finding comfort and belonging among your peers, which is wonderful. At the same time, I can see how the concern about your health could be a source of anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you regarding your condition and your friendships?

User: I'm just afraid that if my symptoms come back, it would create distance between me and my friends. They don’t know much about what I’ve been through. I don’t want them to think I’m a burden or that they should avoid me.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern, Wang. Many people share similar feelings when they worry about their health affecting their relationships. How do you currently manage these fears when they arise?

User: I try to distract myself by focusing on my studies and spending time with friends, but sometimes the anxiety still creeps in, especially when I feel even a little off.

Consultant: It makes sense that when you feel even slightly unwell, your mind jumps to worst-case scenarios about your friendships. Let’s explore this further. When you begin to feel anxious, what sorts of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that once people see me not feeling well, they’ll pull away from me. I also worry that I’ll let them down if I can’t participate in activities like before.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. It’s important to recognize that they may not accurately reflect your friends’ true feelings. We can work together to challenge those thoughts. For instance, do you think there might be other perspectives or evidence that could counter the idea that your friends would pull away from you?

User: Maybe. I think they’ve been supportive so far, but it’s hard for me to remember that in those moments of anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Your friends have shown support, and that’s a strong indicator of their feelings toward you. How about we practice identifying and countering those negative thoughts together? For instance, let's try to find some supportive evidence for why your friends would want to stay connected with you.

User: One of my friends told me that they appreciate how I always encourage them. They’ve said they value my company. 

Consultant: That’s excellent evidence! They appreciate you for who you are, not just how you are feeling. When anxious thoughts come up, remind yourself of these positive affirmations. How does this make you feel about your friendships?

User: It helps a bit. I see that they might actually enjoy spending time with me regardless of my health.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Next, let's think about strategies you could use to communicate with your friends if you ever feel your symptoms returning. Would you be open to discussing how to share your feelings with them in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: Yes, I think that could help. Maybe if I’m honest with them, it wouldn’t feel so heavy on my own.

Consultant: Exactly! Being open helps share the burden. You might say something like, “I have some health challenges that I manage, and if I ever seem off, it’s not about you.” How does that approach sound to you?

User: That feels more reassuring. It gives me a way to keep the communication open without hiding anything.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's also practice how to engage in activities without fear. Are there any fun activities you would like to try with your friends that might help build your confidence while being social?

User: I was thinking of suggesting a movie night soon. It feels less pressure than going out, and we can have fun together at home.

Consultant: A movie night sounds wonderful! It’s a low-pressure situation, and you can enjoy being together without too much stress. How do you feel about planning that with your friends?

User: I feel excited! I think it would be a great way to connect and have some fun.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Engaging in activities that bring joy can really help solidify those relationships. We should also touch on your coping strategies for when you feel anxious. Are there specific techniques that help you calm down?

User: I find that deep breathing exercises help a lot. Sometimes I also listen to music when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are great techniques! Deep breathing can help center your thoughts, and music can be a wonderful way to uplift your mood. Have you considered practicing these techniques in social situations as well?

User: I haven’t really thought about using them with friends. I usually wait until I'm alone to try to calm down.

Consultant: It can be very effective to practice calming techniques even in social settings. Next time, if you start feeling anxious, you might excuse yourself for a moment to focus on your breathing before rejoining. It’s about creating a balance. What do you think?

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: Great! You're developing a toolbox of strategies to help you navigate your friendships while managing your symptoms. As we conclude today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress throughout college. What do you feel has been your biggest growth?

User: I think learning to connect with people and to step out of my comfort zone has been huge for me this past year.

Consultant: That’s an incredible achievement, Wang! Building connections and breaking out of your shell is not easy. As you prepare to enter the workforce, what are some feelings or concerns you have about this transition?

User: I’m nervous about starting my career, but I also feel excited. It’s a big step.

Consultant: Those mixed feelings are perfectly normal. It sounds like you have a lot of opportunities ahead of you. As we wrap up, let’s talk about how you can carry your confidence from these experiences into your next chapter.

User: I think focusing on what I’ve learned and being kind to myself will help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, kindness and self-compassion are key during transitions. You’ve built so much resilience, and I’m confident you’ll carry this forward. If you need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more prepared to tackle what's next.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately as you wrap up your studies and think about your upcoming internship?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I'm proud of finishing my studies, but I'm also really anxious about starting my internship and facing the challenges of the workplace.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. Graduating is a significant achievement, and transitioning into the professional world can stir up a lot of emotions. What specific challenges are you worried about regarding the internship?

User: I think I'm mostly worried about fitting in with my colleagues and being able to meet their expectations. I don't want to let anyone down, and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to keep up with the workload.

Consultant: It sounds like you are placing a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly. Let's take a moment to acknowledge all the hard work that has brought you to this point. Can you share what you're most proud of during your university years?

User: I am really proud of how I managed to complete my courses despite the challenges with my mental health. I never thought I could achieve this after everything I've been through.

Consultant: That's a huge accomplishment, Wang! Overcoming those challenges shows remarkable strength and resilience. How do you think these strengths can help you in your upcoming internship?

User: I think my experiences have taught me to be more adaptable and persistent. I believe I can use that to face the challenges ahead, but sometimes I still doubt myself.

Consultant: It's normal to have doubts, especially when facing new situations. Let's explore those doubts together. What specific thoughts or beliefs come up when you feel uncertain about your abilities?

User: I often think that everyone else is more knowledgeable than me, and I worry they might judge me if I make mistakes.

Consultant: It's common to compare ourselves to others, but it might not be an accurate reflection of reality. How would you evaluate your knowledge and skills compared to those of your peers?

User: I guess I do have a fair amount of knowledge from my studies, and my professors have praised my work before. I just worry that in practical situations, things might be different.

Consultant: It's encouraging to acknowledge your academic achievements! Transitioning from theory to practice can be challenging, but remember that there's a learning curve for everyone. What can you do to prepare for practical situations in your internship?

User: Maybe I could seek advice from people who have done internships before? It might help to hear about their experiences.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Speaking to others can provide valuable insights and help ease some of your fears. Also, consider setting realistic expectations for yourself. How can you remind yourself that making mistakes is a part of the learning process?

User: I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that they're just opportunities for growth. Maybe I can journal my experiences to reflect on what I learn.

Consultant: Journaling is a wonderful tool for reflection! It can help you track your progress and see how far you've come. As your internship begins, it might also be helpful to list down your goals and what you want to achieve each week. Would you be open to creating a plan like that?

User: Yes, I think that would help me stay focused and organized. I just hope I don’t get overwhelmed.

Consultant: Planning can indeed help manage feelings of being overwhelmed. When you start feeling anxious about your tasks, remember to take breaks, use relaxation techniques, or even reach out for support. What strategies have worked for you in the past when dealing with anxiety?

User: Deep breathing has always helped me a little, and talking to friends makes me feel better too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Utilizing deep breathing and reaching out for friends can help ground you during stressful moments. As you look ahead to starting your internship, what encouragement can you give yourself to boost your confidence?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve worked hard to get here and that I’m capable of learning and growing in this new role.

Consultant: Absolutely, Wang! Recognizing your effort and capability is essential. You deserve to be confident in this next step. As we wrap up today, I want you to reflect on the strengths you bring into your internship and remember you can always reach out for help when needed.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance today. I feel more prepared to face the internship now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've shown a lot of growth, and I believe you will do well in your new role. Remember to check in with yourself and practice self-compassion as you navigate this transition. Good luck, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind.
