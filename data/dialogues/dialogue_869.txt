Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you’re here today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling recently. What prompts you to seek support at this time?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down about myself lately. Since my class performance hasn't met my expectations, I'm starting to feel like a failure. It's making me anxious about attending classes and socializing with others.

Consultant: It sounds like your recent experiences have significantly affected your self-esteem and increased your anxiety. Can you share more about what specific thoughts or feelings come to your mind when you think about attending classes or interacting with others?

User: Whenever I think about going to class, I immediately feel nervous. I worry about what my classmates think of me, and I feel like I might embarrass myself. I just can't shake off this feeling that I won't do well.

Consultant: I can see how those worries could be overwhelming. When you have those thoughts about not doing well, what kind of emotions do they stir up for you?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes a little hopeless. It’s like I just want to avoid the situation altogether because the thought of facing it is so scary. 

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. Avoiding those situations might seem like a quick fix, but it can make things harder in the long run. What do you think would happen if you tried to face those feelings instead?

User: I guess I would feel even more anxious, but part of me knows I can't keep avoiding everything. I just don’t know how to change that feeling.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Facing anxiety can be daunting, but it might help to identify the specific thoughts that contribute to that anxiety. What thoughts do you notice in those moments when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think things like, "What if I mess up?" or "Everyone will judge me." I feel like I have to be perfect, which I know isn’t realistic.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly stressful. It sounds like you're holding onto a strong belief that you must be perfect. Can we explore how these thoughts might be limiting your ability to engage with others and in your classes? 

User: Sure. I think that belief makes me feel like I'm never good enough. I feel pressured to perform at a high level, which only increases my anxiety.

Consultant: Let's take a moment to challenge those perfectionist thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports this belief that you must be perfect? Can you think of any counterexamples where things didn't have to be perfect to still work out well?

User: Well, there have been times when I didn’t get a perfect score but still managed to pass. And some of my friends make mistakes, but they laugh it off and seem fine.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s perfectly okay to make mistakes, and it’s great that you can recognize that others experience the same thing. What alternative thought could you adopt instead of thinking you must be perfect?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to just do my best and that getting things wrong is a part of learning.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful alternative thought! Embracing the idea of doing your best rather than being perfect can alleviate some pressure. How do you think adopting this perspective might impact your anxiety about classes and social situations?

User: I think it might help me feel a bit more relaxed. If I’m not constantly thinking about being perfect, maybe I could focus more on being present.

Consultant: That sounds promising, Zhang! Focusing on being present could really help you engage more fully without the weight of perfectionism. What steps can we take to practice this new mindset in your daily life?

User: Maybe I could start by reminding myself to breathe when I feel anxious and to allow myself to make mistakes during class discussions or interactions.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Taking deep breaths can help calm your nerves, and giving yourself permission to make mistakes is liberating. How about we create a small goal for you to practice this week? 

User: I think I can try to participate more in class, even if it’s just answering a question or two. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Participating a little more in class is a fantastic way to practice your new mindset. How do you anticipate feeling after trying this out?

User: I think I’ll be nervous initially, but hopefully, I’ll feel more confident over time, especially if I remind myself it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous at first, but it sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Let’s continue to build on this progress. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. I like the idea of trying out new thoughts and behaviors. It gives me hope that I can change how I feel.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, change takes time, but you’re on the right path. Before we wrap up, let’s briefly reflect on what you've learned today and how you can apply it going forward.

User: I’ve learned that my perfectionist thoughts are causing a lot of my anxiety, and I can replace them with more realistic thoughts. Plus, I can start participating more in class next week.

Consultant: That’s a great summary! I believe you’re making significant strides. As we finish today, remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re capable of this change, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and understanding. I feel more empowered to face my challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I’m here to support you. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further guidance. Looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! Welcome to today's session. I’d like to start by hearing how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting. 

User: Hi! I’ve been really anxious. I participated in a group activity recently, and it was overwhelming. I felt ignored and it made my anxiety worse.

Consultant: I see, that sounds really challenging for you. It’s understandable to feel anxious in social situations, especially when you feel overlooked. Can you tell me more about what you were feeling during that activity?

User: I felt like everyone was looking at me, but not really seeing me. I was nervous and couldn’t speak up. My heart was racing, and I started to sweat.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It seems like being in that social environment triggered your anxiety. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I spoke. I felt like I didn’t belong there, almost like I was invisible.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite powerful, intensifying your feelings of anxiety. Let’s explore this further: what evidence do you have that speaking up would lead to embarrassment?

User: I guess I don't really have strong evidence. It’s just a fear I've had for a long time. 

Consultant: Fear often arises from past experiences, and it can distort our perceptions of situations. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn’t worry so much. Everyone feels awkward sometimes, and it’s okay to just be themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It seems like you recognize that these fears might not be as solid as they feel in the moment. Let’s try to challenge some of these thoughts. How might you reframe the idea of speaking up in a group?

User: Maybe I could think of it as just sharing my thoughts, not as a performance where I have to be perfect. 

Consultant: That’s a great way to reframe it! Focusing on sharing rather than performing can help reduce the pressure you feel. Do you think shifting to this mindset could help you feel a little calmer?

User: Yes, it might help a bit. I have to remember that it’s okay to just share my opinions.

Consultant: Exactly! And it’s a learning process too. How about we come up with a small step you could take in future social situations to test this new perspective?

User: I could try asking a question during our next group meeting instead of just waiting to speak.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic step! Asking questions can often feel less daunting than making statements. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. Just thinking about it makes me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign. Embracing small steps can lead to significant changes over time. Are there other specific situations where you’d like to practice this new mindset?

User: Maybe in class discussions. I rarely raise my hand, but I want to try participating more.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Participating in class discussions is a wonderful opportunity to practice. How do you think you’ll prepare yourself beforehand to help ease your anxiety?

User: I could remind myself to breathe and think about my new approach before I raise my hand.

Consultant: Breathing exercises are an excellent way to calm your body and mind. We can practice some techniques together if you’d like. What do you think?

User: I’d love that! I think practicing will really help me.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s incorporate some breathing exercises in our sessions. In the meantime, how are you feeling about tackling these social situations moving forward?

User: I feel a mixture of nervousness and excitement. I want to try but I’m still scared.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both nervous and excited! Change takes time and practice. You’re already showing a willingness to face your fears, and that’s a crucial step. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I hope I can keep reminding myself of these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I believe you can do this. What will you take away from our session today?

User: I want to focus on reframing my thoughts and trying to speak up more in class. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As you work on these skills, remember to be kind to yourself. Changing thought patterns and behaviors takes time. 

User: I will, thank you! I’m looking forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: I am too, Zhang! We’ll continue to build on what we’ve discussed today. Take care until then, and remember to practice those breathing exercises. 

User: I will, thanks again! See you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to today’s session! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been reflecting a lot on our last discussion. I feel more aware of my thoughts, but I still doubt my abilities, especially after the group discussion. It was really discouraging.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve made some progress in understanding your thoughts, but the doubts about your abilities are still weighing you down. Can you tell me more about what happened during the group discussion?

User: During the discussion, I felt like I couldn't express my thoughts clearly. I was worried about what others would think. I ended up saying very little and it made me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: It sounds like the experience was quite difficult for you. Feeling like you couldn't voice your thoughts must have been very frustrating. What thoughts went through your mind during that moment?

User: I thought I’d look foolish if I spoke up. I kept thinking that everyone else was smarter than me and wouldn’t take me seriously.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite powerful. It seems like they made you feel inadequate and anxious. What feelings did those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I felt a mix of anxiety and sadness. I wished I could be more confident like some of my classmates. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a group setting. Let’s explore this a bit more—why do you think you view your classmates as being more capable than you?

User: I guess it’s because they always seem so articulate and self-assured. I feel out of place and really shy about speaking up.

Consultant: That feeling of being out of place can be tough to deal with. But let’s challenge that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that you are not capable, compared to them?

User: Well, I guess academically I haven't performed as well after leaving middle school. But I have done well in other subjects before.

Consultant: It's important to recognize that your past achievements do matter. Remember, many factors influence how we perform in different situations. What if we looked at those past successes as proof of your abilities instead?

User: I hadn’t thought of it that way. I just focus on my recent struggles.

Consultant: Shifting the focus from struggles to past successes can help build your self-confidence. How about we try to frame some of those past achievements positively? Can you recall a moment where you felt proud of yourself in a social or academic setting?

User: Well, I did participate in a class project last year. I took initiative in organizing everything, and I felt proud of that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! It shows you have the ability to lead and contribute positively. How can we take that experience to help you in future interactions, like group discussions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of that moment before speaking up next time. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! By recalling your accomplishments, you can build a more positive mindset. What other thoughts could you replace those negative thoughts with to feel more empowered?

User: I could tell myself that everyone has their strengths and that I have something valuable to contribute, too.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing your unique contributions can lead to a shift in perspective. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about this new way of thinking?

User: It gives me a bit more hope, I think. I want to believe that I can improve.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Setting small, achievable goals in social situations could also help. What might be a small step you could take to practice speaking up more?

User: Maybe I could start by contributing one idea in our next group meeting. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! It’s a manageable step to build your confidence. How do you feel about committing to that?

User: I feel more motivated now. I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It’s all about taking those small steps towards improvement. How will you remind yourself of your strengths when you feel uncertain in that moment?

User: I think I’ll write down some of my past successes and carry it with me for encouragement.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Having a tangible reminder can really help boost your confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s that I should focus on my achievements and believe in my ability to improve. It's nice to have a different perspective.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made a significant realization today, and I’m proud of you for that. Always remember that your journey is ongoing. If you start to feel overwhelmed, you can return to these new thoughts. How are you feeling about your progress as we finish today?

User: I feel relieved and encouraged. I’m excited to try my new strategies!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s been great working through these thoughts with you. Remember, every step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about trying to interact with my classmates. I still get nervous, but it seems like there’s a slight improvement.

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear! It's great that you feel there's been some progress. Can you share a specific moment from your recent interactions that made you feel that way?

User: Well, there was this one time in class when I spoke up to answer a question. I felt a bit anxious beforehand, but afterwards, I was really happy that I did it.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step for you! I can see how that would feel rewarding. What emotions did you experience before, during, and after speaking up?

User: Before, I was really anxious and worried about messing up. During, I felt a rush of adrenaline. After, I felt proud of myself, but also a bit hesitant about how they might perceive me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those mixed feelings. Your pride in speaking up is a positive outcome! How do you think you can build on that experience in future interactions?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself of how good I felt afterwards. Maybe practicing speaking more might help as well.

Consultant: Those are good strategies! Reminding yourself of the positive feelings is important. What kind of practice do you think would be beneficial to you?

User: Perhaps I could try to initiate conversations more often, even if it's just small talk. 

Consultant: Initiating small talk sounds like an excellent plan! What topics do you think would be easier for you to start with? 

User: I think discussing classes or recent events might be simpler. I could comment on something happening around us.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach. It gives you a starting point to engage others. How does thinking about this make you feel about reaching out to your classmates?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I want to push myself a bit more.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Feeling nervous is natural, but it sounds like you’re ready to take that step. What are your thoughts about possibly role-playing some scenarios here to practice?

User: That could help! I think practicing would make me feel more prepared in actual situations.

Consultant: I believe it will definitely help you feel more confident. Let’s start with a simple scenario—imagine you are in class, and you want to ask a classmate about their weekend. How might you approach them?

User: I could say something like, "Hey, did you do anything fun over the weekend?"

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opener! It’s friendly and straightforward. How do you think they might respond? 

User: They might say yes and share something, but I’m also worried they might not engage back.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Remember, not every interaction will go perfectly, and that's okay. What would you do if they didn't engage?

User: I guess I could think of it as practice. I wouldn’t take it personally; I'd just try to move on.

Consultant: Exactly! Viewing it as practice can help reduce the pressure. How can you remind yourself of this mindset when you feel nervous before approaching someone?

User: Maybe I could write a note to myself, reminding me that it's okay to practice and it's not a big deal if it doesn't go as planned.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Having a physical reminder can help ground you in those moments of anxiety. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I'm feeling more confident now. I think it’s a good strategy, and I’ll definitely try it.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, let’s talk about what you can take away from today’s session. What do you feel you've gained?

User: I feel I have some practical strategies to engage more with my classmates and a better understanding of handling my nerves.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress! You’re building a foundation to increase your social interactions. Remember, keep practicing, and be kind to yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance in this.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working together. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support. Until next time, keep embracing those small steps forward!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've felt a bit better in terms of accepting positive feedback. Still, sometimes I doubt whether my performance in group activities is actually good enough. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better. Doubting your performance can be quite common, especially after receiving recognition. Can you share more about a specific instance when you received positive feedback recently?

User: Well, in our last group project, my classmates praised my input. But right after that, I started thinking maybe they were just being nice, and my contribution wasn't really that valuable.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you experienced a moment of joy from their recognition but then slipped into self-doubt. What thoughts were running through your mind after they praised you?

User: I remember thinking, "I hope they don’t realize I’m actually not that good." I felt like I was just playing along.

Consultant: So, you felt like a bit of an imposter despite the praise. This is interesting. How do you think this thought affects your feelings and confidence?

User: It makes me feel anxious and unsure about myself, like I'm constantly trying to prove I'm not a fraud.

Consultant: That sounds very heavy to carry. Let's explore this thought more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I don't have strong evidence. It's mostly just my feelings of inadequacy, especially since my grades have dropped since junior high.

Consultant: It's understandable to relate your past academic challenges to your current feelings. Are there moments when you felt proud of your abilities or contributions, perhaps even outside of academics?

User: Yes, there have been times when I helped organize events or when friends came to me for advice. I enjoyed that and felt capable.

Consultant: Those are important moments to recognize! They show that you have strengths and can bring value in various areas. Can we replace the self-doubting thought with a more balanced view? For example, you could think, "I have strengths, and my contributions are valuable."

User: That makes sense. It feels more balanced to remind myself of my strengths. 

Consultant: I'm glad it resonates with you. Remembering those strengths can help fortify your confidence. How would it feel to actively remind yourself of those moments when you doubt your abilities?

User: I think it would help a lot. I often forget those moments when I'm in self-doubt.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maybe we can create a simple strategy where you note down your achievements or positive feedback whenever it happens. This way, when self-doubt creeps in, you can review your list.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could keep a little journal to jot down those positive moments.

Consultant: Exactly! This journal can become a tangible reminder of your value. How do you think you would feel after revisiting these moments in writing?

User: I think it would help lift my spirits and give me more confidence in social situations.

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! As we continue, what specific social situations do you find most challenging currently?

User: I still struggle a bit when talking in larger groups. I feel anxious about how I’ll be perceived.

Consultant: Group dynamics can be tricky. How about we work on strategies to tackle that anxiety? Are there small steps you can take to gradually feel more comfortable in those settings?

User: Maybe I could try to contribute at least one thought in the next group discussion. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Committing to one thoughtful contribution can be a huge step forward. How would you prepare yourself for that next discussion?

User: I could mentally note a few points I want to share beforehand, so I feel ready when the time comes.

Consultant: Preparing ahead of time is an excellent approach. It lessens the pressure in the moment. As you practice, how do you think your feelings about group discussions might change?

User: I hope I would feel less anxious and more prepared, maybe even enjoy the process more.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re developing a positive mindset about this! Remember, each experience is a step toward improving your confidence. How has your perception of feedback changed since we started discussing it?

User: I think I’m starting to see it as constructive rather than something to fear. 

Consultant: That’s a crucial shift! Feedback is indeed an essential part of growth. As we wrap up today, let's reflect. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I've learned to remind myself of my strengths and to view feedback positively. I believe I can manage my self-doubt better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Embracing those strategies will certainly help you on your journey. How about we set some goals for the next time we meet, perhaps focusing on your journal and the upcoming group discussion?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I feel ready to take those steps.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m proud of the progress you’re making, Zhang. Remember, it’s about celebrating small victories along the way. I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. Being part of that interest group has helped me a lot. I feel a sense of belonging now.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Feeling a sense of belonging is so important. Can you tell me more about how being in that group has changed your feelings and experiences?

User: Well, I used to feel really isolated and anxious around people, but now I look forward to participating in the activities. It makes me feel more connected.

Consultant: It's amazing to hear that you're looking forward to activities now. How do you feel this change has affected your overall mood and outlook on your social life?

User: I feel more optimistic, and I’ve even started talking to some people outside of the group. It’s refreshing!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic development! Building connections can really improve your overall well-being. Are there any specific moments or interactions that stood out to you recently?

User: Yes, there was this moment when I shared my thoughts during a discussion. I was scared at first, but everyone was supportive, and it felt great.

Consultant: Sharing your thoughts in a supportive environment is a big step. It shows you're gaining confidence. How do you think this experience can help you in future interactions?

User: I think it helps me realize that people are not as judgmental as I thought. I can be more open in conversations now.

Consultant: Recognizing that people can be supportive is significant. What strategies could you use to continue this openness in your future interactions, both in and outside the group?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to express my feelings. I can also try to initiate conversations more.

Consultant: Those are excellent thoughts! Initiating conversations can be challenging but also rewarding. What might be a small step you can take to practice this?

User: Maybe I could start with asking someone a simple question or sharing something about my day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful place to begin! Starting small can help ease any anxiety. How do you feel about planning this for the upcoming week?

User: I feel excited to try it! It doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s think about how you can reflect on these experiences afterward. How do you plan to check in with yourself about how it goes?

User: I might write down my feelings after each interaction, to see how I felt before and after.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Journaling can help you process your feelings and recognize your progress. Is there anything specific you hope to achieve or learn from these upcoming interactions?

User: I hope to feel more comfortable speaking to new people and see if I can maintain these relationships.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid goal! Building comfort and maintaining relationships takes time, but it seems like you're well on your way. How can I support you in this process moving forward?

User: Just having these sessions helps a lot. Maybe some reminders to stay positive as I go through this would be nice.

Consultant: Absolutely, I can certainly provide that encouragement. Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs, but acknowledging your efforts is key. Would you like us to discuss some positive affirmations you can use?

User: That would be helpful! Something I can tell myself when I feel anxious would be great.

Consultant: How about something like, “I am capable of connecting with others, and my voice matters”? Would that resonate with you?

User: Yes, I like that! It feels empowering.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way. As you continue on this journey, remember to celebrate your small victories, too. How do you feel about our session today overall?

User: I feel really good about it! It helps me see how far I’ve come and what I can do next.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made remarkable progress. As we wrap up, let’s summarize the key points you’ve identified today.

User: I’ll focus on initiating conversations, keep a journal of my feelings, and remind myself of my worth.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are all actionable strategies. You’re doing amazing, Zhang. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more prepared to face social situations now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I’m confident you’ll continue to grow. This concludes our session today, but I'm looking forward to our next meeting!

User: Thanks again! Take care!
