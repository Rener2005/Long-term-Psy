Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to today’s session. I would like to hear more about how you’ve been feeling regarding your math class and your teacher. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really frustrated with math lately. I just can’t seem to get over my negative feelings towards my math teacher. It’s affecting how I view the subject itself.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like your feelings towards your teacher are really influencing your feelings about math as a whole. Can you tell me more about what specifically bothers you about the teacher?

User: Well, I feel like he doesn’t explain things well. He often gets impatient, and that makes me anxious when I ask questions. It’s like he doesn't care if we understand.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling anxious about asking questions in class can be very discouraging. How does that make you feel about participating in math lessons?

User: I just don’t want to be in the class anymore. I dread going to math. I used to enjoy it, but now it feels like a chore.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel this way when you associate discomfort with a subject that’s important for your studies. You mentioned earlier that you once enjoyed math; what do you think has changed since then?

User: I think it’s mostly the pressure and the way my teacher interacts with us. I feel overwhelmed, and now I can’t even focus on the actual math concepts.

Consultant: That overwhelming feeling can really hinder your ability to learn. Let’s try to break it down a bit. Can you share any specific instances where your teacher’s actions made you feel this way?

User: There was this time during a test when I didn’t understand a question and asked him for help. He snapped at me, and I felt so embarrassed. Since then, I just shut down in class.

Consultant: I can understand how that experience would make you hesitant to ask for help again. It sounds humiliating, and understandably, it has affected your courage to engage in the classroom. How do you feel during your lessons now?

User: I just feel anxious all the time, like I can’t breathe when I’m in class. I don’t want to raise my hand anymore.

Consultant: That's extremely challenging. It's important to have a safe space to learn without feeling that pressure. What do you think would help make your learning experience feel safer?

User: I guess if I felt more confident in my understanding of math, I wouldn’t be so scared of asking questions.

Consultant: Building that confidence is a great goal. Can we explore some ways to help you regain that understanding and develop a more positive relationship with the subject, irrespective of your teacher?

User: Sure, that sounds good. I just want to find a way to enjoy math again.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with identifying one area in math you still feel somewhat confident in and brainstorm ways to reinforce that understanding. What do you think?

User: Maybe geometry? I used to like shapes and angles. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful start! Geometry offers a lot of interesting concepts. Let’s think about some exercises or visual aids that could help you engage with geometry more. How might you incorporate those into your study routine?

User: I could look for online resources or videos about geometry to get a better grasp. I think practicing visuals would help.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Visual learning can be very effective. Additionally, if we focus on geometry, you may find yourself feeling more competent, which could help with your confidence in math overall. 

User: Yes, and I think if I feel better about geometry, it might carry over to my other math classes too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining confidence in one area can often help alleviate anxiety in others. Let's also discuss how we can address your feelings about your teacher. Would it be useful for you to practice some assertive communication techniques for when you feel overwhelmed in class?

User: That could help! I want to learn how to stand up for myself a bit better.

Consultant: That’s a valuable skill to develop. We could practice ways to express your needs before or after class when things are less tense. How would that sound to you?

User: I think that could work. It’d be less stressful than trying to talk in front of everyone.

Consultant: Right! Building that communication skill could empower you. Before we finish today’s session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and how you can start applying these strategies until our next meeting.

User: Sure! So, I’ll focus on geometry with online resources and practice assertive communication with my teacher outside of class.

Consultant: Exactly! This will help you regain confidence in your math skills while also tackling your concerns about your teacher. As we move forward, what would it look like for you to reflect on these experiences and continue seeking engagement with math?

User: I’ll try to keep a journal about my feelings after class. Writing it down might help me see my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Journaling can provide clarity and help you recognize your growth and challenges. When we meet next time, we can review what you’ve discovered. 

User: I’m looking forward to it! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! Remember, it’s a journey, and I believe in your ability to navigate this. I'm excited to hear about your progress. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to adapt, which is great. Can you share a bit more about what specifically feels overwhelming or confusing during class?

User: Well, sometimes when the teacher explains things in a way that seems different from what I'm used to, I just can't follow along. It makes me feel like I'm not good at math, and I get frustrated.

Consultant: That’s understandable, feeling frustrated can be quite discouraging. It’s important to recognize those feelings. When you notice the teacher using a different style, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think, "Why can't I understand this?" and then I feel like I'm falling behind. It really makes me anxious about asking questions.

Consultant: I see, so those thoughts lead to anxiety about participation. Let's explore that. What evidence do you have that you're falling behind, and is there any other perspective you could consider? 

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence. It's just a feeling. I mean, I do try to keep up with my assignments and test my knowledge, but in the moment, I tend to assume I'm the only one struggling.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It's easy to feel alone in those moments. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about feeling confused but still trying to keep up?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to ask questions and that everyone learns differently. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Maybe we can use that idea for yourself. How might your experience change if you allowed yourself to ask questions when you're confused?

User: I think it would help me a lot. I might not feel so isolated, and it could clarify things for me.

Consultant: Exactly! Seeking clarification can actually support your learning process. Let's discuss ways you can frame your questions when you feel lost, so you feel more equipped to engage in class. 

User: That sounds helpful. I could start by summarizing what I understand before asking what I don’t grasp completely.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Summarizing your understanding can pave the way for more productive questions. How do you think your relationship with the teacher might change if you approached them this way?

User: I think it might help me connect better with them, and they might appreciate that I’m trying to understand.

Consultant: Absolutely! This approach can foster a more collaborative relationship. Let’s brainstorm a few actual questions you could ask in class that would feel comfortable for you.

User: Maybe I could ask for examples or if there are alternative ways to view a problem. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas. Asking for examples can clarify concepts, and inquiring about alternative methods showcases your willingness to learn. Do you feel nervous about saying these in front of the class?

User: A little bit. I worry that the other students will think I'm slow if I ask too many questions.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Remember, by asking questions, you’re actually contributing to your learning and potentially helping others who might feel the same way. Can you think of any situations in the past where asking questions led to positive outcomes?

User: There was a time when I asked a question during a science class, and the teacher gave me a really helpful explanation. It actually helped me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! Reflecting on that positive experience could help ease your anxiety about asking questions in math. How about we set a goal for you to ask at least one question in the next class?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll start with a simple question to build my confidence.

Consultant: I love that plan! Starting small can create momentum. Before we wrap up, what are the key takeaways for you from today’s session that you can apply moving forward?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to ask for help and that I can clarify my understanding through questions. Also, focusing on my progress makes me less anxious.

Consultant: That's fantastic, Wang! Remember, progress takes time and practice. As we move forward, keep reminding yourself of these strategies. Would you like to discuss anything else before we conclude today?

User: No, I feel good about our conversation. Thank you for the support!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Next time, we can check in on how things went in class. Take care, and I’ll see you then!

User: Yes, and I feel more equipped to handle my anxiety about talking to him. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! As you venture into these conversations, remember to be patient with yourself. What do you think will help you maintain this newfound confidence?

User: I think I’ll remind myself to focus on how the conversation could be a two-way street, instead of just worrying about his reaction.

User: I feel anxious and a bit embarrassed. I really don’t want to let my group down.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and embarrassment can hold us back. What if we challenged that thought? What evidence do you have that your ideas aren't good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I mean, my classmates liked my recent solution. But sometimes I just focus on the fear of making a mistake.

Consultant: That's an important realization! It seems you're really doing well in those moments, yet the fear of errors can cloud your confidence. If a friend were in your situation, how would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it's okay to learn from them. I wouldn’t want them to feel anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s great advice! It seems you’re able to offer kindness to others. Now, let’s turn that compassion toward yourself. What might happen if you started seeing mistakes as opportunities for growth instead?
