Consultant: Hello! I'm happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit lonely. I really want to connect with others, especially since I have a chance to interact with the elderly group, but I find myself hesitating.

Consultant: I see. It's great that you're recognizing the desire to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what hesitations are coming up for you when you think about participating in that group?

User: I guess I'm afraid of bothering people or that they might not want to include me. I've always preferred being alone, so it's hard to change that.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can feel daunting to step out of our comfort zones. What do you think would happen if you did reach out and got involved in the group?

User: I worry that they might not really be interested in me, or that I might not know what to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common. Let’s explore those feelings. Can you recall any times in the past when you reached out to someone and had a positive interaction?

User: Well, there was a time when I attended a small gathering with some friends. I did have a good time talking, but then I felt awkward afterward as if I had overstepped.

Consultant: It's interesting that you had a good time, yet your mind focused on the awkwardness afterward. What evidence do you have that your presence was unwelcome during that gathering?

User: I suppose there was no clear sign that they weren't happy to see me. I just felt that way inside.

Consultant: It sounds like that feeling may stem from your past experiences and perhaps a tendency to interpret situations negatively. What if we challenged that thought? How would you feel about asking yourself if others might enjoy your company instead?

User: That feels a little freeing to think about! But I still have that nagging worry in the back of my mind.

Consultant: It's normal to have those feelings. Let's also think about some small steps you could take to ease into social interactions. What do you think about starting with just saying hello to someone in the group?

User: That might be a manageable first step. Maybe starting small will help me ease into it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small can make a big difference. Can you think of a particular situation where you could practice this approach?

User: There’s a meeting next week where I might be able to say hello to a few folks. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! How would you feel about setting a goal to greet one person at that meeting?

User: I’ll give it a try. It feels less intimidating when I think about it that way.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for stepping up like this! Remember, even a simple greeting can open doors. What might go well if you do say hello?

User: Maybe they’ll be friendly and we can have a light conversation. 

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Focusing on that possibility can help you feel more confident. How would you plan to celebrate that small success once it happens?

User: Oh, I could treat myself to a nice snack or spend time gardening afterwards. 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward! Reinforcing your achievements, no matter how small, is vital. As you think about this upcoming meeting, what else could help reduce your anxiety?

User: Perhaps preparing a couple of simple topics to talk about would help me feel more ready.

Consultant: That's a smart strategy! Having a few topics in mind can boost your confidence. What topics might you consider?

User: I could mention the plants I'm growing or ask about their experiences in the club.

Consultant: Those sound like great conversation starters! Sharing your interests can spark connections. How does that make you feel about reaching out to others?

User: I feel a bit more at ease. It seems less overwhelming, thinking about it this way.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that! Remember, socializing is a skill that can grow with practice. If you find yourself feeling anxious, what technique can you use to calm those nerves?

User: Breathing exercises have helped me before. I could try those if I start to feel nervous.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Deep breathing can be a fantastic tool for calming anxiety. As we prepare for our next session, what do you think you’d like to discuss regarding your experiences with the group?

User: I’d like to share how the greeting went and if I managed to engage in any conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive plan! Before we conclude, let’s summarize today’s insights. You’ve identified your hesitations, outlined small steps, and even chose some methods to foster confidence. When you reflect on what we've discussed today, what stands out to you?

User: I feel hopeful that I can try to engage in social activities and not let my fears hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, growth comes with practice. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today’s session. I’m looking forward to hearing about your thoughts and feelings since our last meeting. How have you been feeling about social interactions lately?

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. After participating in that community Hulusi performance, I noticed that people seemed to appreciate my interest, which made me feel good. But I still worry about bothering others when I try to join in.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that your performance was well-received! It sounds like you’re starting to see the positive side of social interactions. Can you tell me more about those worries? What specifically makes you feel as though you might be bothering others?

User: Well, I think maybe my presence isn’t welcomed or that people don’t really want to engage with me. Sometimes I feel like I should just keep to myself to avoid imposing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're venturing into social settings more often. However, it's also important to recognize that being part of a community and sharing your interests can be enriching for both you and others. Can you recall a moment when you enjoyed being around others, perhaps during that performance?

User: Yes, during the performance, I felt really connected with everyone. I could see smiles and nods, which made me happy. But afterward, I just felt unsure about approaching people again.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment of connection was quite fulfilling for you! Let's explore the feelings you had during that time. What thoughts crossed your mind when you noticed the positive reactions from others?

User: I thought maybe I could be more involved, but then I worried again about whether they really wanted me there.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. You had a positive experience, yet the fear of not being welcomed crept back in. What evidence do you have that might challenge those worries? For instance, the smiles you received could suggest they appreciated your participation.

User: That’s true. I guess they did seem happy to see me there. I just need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of those positive interactions can help shift your mindset. What if you used that experience as a stepping stone to engage more with others? How might you approach someone the next time you’re in a social setting?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple greeting or compliment. But it still feels intimidating.

Consultant: It can definitely feel intimidating! Starting with a friendly greeting is a great idea. Consider it as an invitation for conversation. If it doesn’t go as planned, remember that it's not a reflection of your worth or likability. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: That does make sense. I guess I can try to view it more lightly and not take things too personally.

Consultant: That’s a very healthy approach! Lightening the pressure on yourself can help make social interactions less daunting. What other small steps can you envision taking to connect with others?

User: I could try visiting the community center more often or maybe joining a class. It could help me meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy will likely connect you with others who share those interests. How do you feel about actively seeking those opportunities?

User: It sounds exciting! I just hope I can handle the nerves that come with initiating conversations.

Consultant: That’s completely natural. Nervousness often comes with new situations. If you feel anxiety about approaching someone, you can take deep breaths and remind yourself of the positive experiences you’ve had. What strategies do you think could help you on that front?

User: I could practice some breathing techniques beforehand. Maybe even prepare a few conversation starters.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Having conversation starters can ease some anxiety about what to say. You’re taking valuable steps forward to remain engaged. Can you remind me of any specific topics or questions you might consider?

User: I could ask about their hobbies or comment on something happening around us. Simple things like that.

Consultant: Those are excellent starters! Asking about their hobbies not only shows your interest but can also lead to deeper conversations. How do you feel about trying this out and seeing how it goes?

User: I feel more confident now that I have some ideas! Even though I am still a bit anxious, I want to give it a shot.

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. It's normal to feel some tension; the important thing is that you're taking steps to push through it. What will be your next step after our session today?

User: I think I’ll look for a class in the community center this week. That feels like a good starting point!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Seeking out new opportunities is a positive step forward. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress. How do you feel about the changes and the steps you’re planning to take?

User: I feel hopeful, like I’m moving towards getting more involved, even if it feels a bit intimidating. It feels good to think about connecting with others.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Remember that you’ve made significant progress in overcoming your fears. When you tell yourself these positive affirmations, it can boost your confidence. Before we end today, how do you envision maintaining this momentum moving forward?

User: I think by setting small goals to interact more frequently, maybe even tracking my feelings after each interaction. It’ll help me see my growth.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant approach! Tracking your feelings can give you insight into your progress and help reinforce those positive experiences. As we conclude today’s session, remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, but you’re capable of fostering connections. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll take it step by step and see how it goes.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about our last conversation. I organized a small family gathering, and while it was nice to see my uncle and nephew, I still felt quite anxious in that social setting.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you took the step to organize a gathering. It's completely normal to feel anxious in social situations, especially when you're trying to reconnect with family. Can you share what specific feelings or thoughts came up for you during the gathering?

User: I felt happy to see them, but I was also worried about how I was coming across. I kept thinking, "What if they think I'm boring?" This made me a bit more quiet than I wanted to be.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a mix of positive feelings and some worries about how others perceive you. Let's explore those thoughts a little more. What evidence do you have that they might think you're boring?

User: Well, I just feel like sometimes my stories aren’t interesting because I don’t have a lot going on in my life.

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to compare our experiences to others and feel that they might not measure up. But let's consider this: if your uncle and nephew wanted to see you, it’s likely that they value your company. What do you think about that perspective?

User: That makes sense. I suppose they wouldn’t come just to be polite. 

Consultant: Exactly! They probably enjoy spending time with you. How about we think of some topics or activities you could bring into your next gathering to help ease your anxiety about being perceived as boring?

User: I could share some stories about the flowers I’m growing or maybe show them some of my fish. That might spark some conversation.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Sharing your interests can definitely engage others and lessen that pressure. What if you planned to talk about one of those interests at the next family gathering? How does that feel?

User: That feels manageable. I think I could do that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Planning to share something you’re passionate about can make it easier to connect with others. In terms of socializing, how do you feel about inviting them to do an activity together, like going to the park or visiting a local event?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually prefer to keep things small, but it might be nice to do something out in the community.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Engaging in community activities can help you meet new people and build a support network. Is there a specific event or activity happening soon that you'd feel comfortable inviting them to join?

User: There’s a local flower show coming up. I could invite them to that; it would match my interest and be a nice outing.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It combines your passion with a chance to socialize. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous about reaching out to them.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about reaching out. Perhaps we can break it down into smaller steps. What if you start by sending a casual message to gauge their interest before making a formal invitation?

User: That seems doable. A casual message sounds less intimidating.

Consultant: Great! This way, you're initiating contact without added pressure. How about we role-play how you might compose that message?

User: Sure! I could say something like, "Hi! There's a flower show next weekend. Would you like to join me?"

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It's friendly and straightforward. How confident do you feel about sending that message?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I think I could send it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Taking that initiative can help you feel more connected. After you send it, reflect on how it feels and share your experiences in our next session. Remember to celebrate each small step you take.

User: Thank you, I will! I’m beginning to see that interacting with my family can be enjoyable and that I have a lot to share.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It seems like you are beginning to appreciate the joy of reconnecting with family. Let’s keep building on that in our future sessions. 

User: Yes, I feel positive about continuing to work on this.

Consultant: That’s great! You’re making wonderful progress in engaging socially. Keep embracing these opportunities. I look forward to hearing how your message goes and how the flower show turns out!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to enhance your social interactions. Take care until next time!

User: I will! Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you've been exploring social interactions recently, particularly in your gardening interest group. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! I've felt surprisingly relaxed in that group. It's nice to talk with others who share similar interests, and I even enjoyed the conversations we had.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re finding some joy in socializing. Could you share a bit more about what specifically made those conversations enjoyable for you?

User: Well, I think it’s because we are all focused on our gardening projects, so there’s a common topic to discuss. I felt less pressure to keep the conversation going.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Engaging in discussions about shared interests can really ease the pressure. What other feelings did you experience during the interactions with the group members?

User: I felt a sense of belonging, like I was part of something. It reminded me of when I used to enjoy spending time with family during family gatherings.

Consultant: That sense of belonging can be incredibly fulfilling. It sounds like reconnecting with that feeling is valuable for you. Have you had any moments during these interactions where you felt particularly happy or appreciated?

User: Yes, there was one moment when a member complimented my plant arrangement. I was so pleased that someone noticed my effort and liked it.

Consultant: That’s a lovely moment to celebrate! Compliments can be a powerful way to boost our feelings of worth and connection. How did receiving that compliment impact your desire to participate in future group activities?

User: It really encouraged me to join more. I think feeling appreciated makes me want to engage more actively. I’ve been thinking about sharing my gardening tips next time.

Consultant: Sharing your tips sounds like an excellent idea! It could also spark more conversations and enhance your connections within the group. What other activities or events related to gardening might you consider participating in?

User: I heard they’re organizing a garden tour next month. I’m tempted to join! It could be a fun way to meet more people and share our experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic opportunity to expand your social network further. What do you think might be some benefits of participating in that event?

User: I guess it could help me make new friends and get inspired by different gardening styles. Plus, it would be fun to see other gardens.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining inspiration and making new friends can enrich your experiences. Are there any feelings of apprehension or excitement about joining the tour?

User: I do feel a bit anxious about meeting new people, but I am excited to see the gardens and share my thoughts.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both excited and anxious about new social situations. One approach could be to focus on the excitement and what you can contribute to the discussions. How do you think that might help?

User: I think focusing on what I can bring instead of worrying would definitely ease my anxiety. It shifts my mindset to look forward to the experience.

Consultant: Yes, shifting your focus can be very beneficial. Remember, you’re not just there to be a participant; you have unique insights to share. What will be your next step to prepare for this garden tour?

User: I could think of a few gardening tips to share and maybe practice what I want to say. It would help boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Practicing ahead of time can really help you feel more confident and comfortable. Let’s also discuss how you will remind yourself of your successes, like when you received that compliment, to build your confidence as you approach new social interactions.

User: That’s true—I should reflect on those positive moments. It would remind me that I can connect with people.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your past positive experiences can reinforce your belief in your social abilities. How about we explore some strategies to help recall those moments when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to jot down happy moments and compliments I receive. That way, I have something to look back on.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! A journal can serve as a personal reminder of your strengths and positive interactions. On days you feel apprehensive, you can read through it to uplift your spirits. How does that sound to you?

User: I really like that idea. It could help remind me of my progress and boost my mood when I feel low.

Consultant: I’m glad you found it helpful. As you continue to engage in social activities, remember to acknowledge your successful interactions and small victories. It’s all about building those positive feelings over time. 

User: Yes, it feels good to think about it this way. I’m excited to embrace these new opportunities!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As we approach the end of our session today, what do you think is the most significant takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s realizing how much I value social connections and how I can actively contribute to them. Journaling can also be very useful.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful realization. Keeping track of your feelings and experiences can greatly enhance your confidence in social situations. Before we conclude, how do you envision your social life evolving in the coming weeks?

User: I hope to participate more in the gardening group, attend the tour, and slowly open up to new friendships. I want to feel more connected.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal to aim for! I believe you're on the right path, and I’m here to support you in your journey. Whenever you feel the need for guidance, remember that you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session and sharing my experiences.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing all about your adventures. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm delighted you're here today. It seems you've been engaging in some positive social activities recently. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi. Yes, I helped plan a community festival, and it was really rewarding. The feedback was great, but I’m still unsure about how to keep participating.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a wonderful experience! You’re feeling recognized for your contribution. Let’s explore what aspects of that event you enjoyed the most and how we can build on that. What were your favorite moments?

User: I loved seeing people come together and having fun. It felt good to be a part of something bigger, rather than being alone all the time.

Consultant: That’s such a meaningful insight. Being part of a community can significantly enhance our sense of belonging. How did it feel to connect with others during that event?

User: It was nice. I was a bit nervous at first, but once I started talking to people, it felt natural. I realized I could handle social interactions better than I thought.

Consultant: That’s a significant revelation! You’ve gained confidence through this interaction. Do you think this experience could encourage you to seek out more social opportunities in the future?

User: I hope so. I think I’d like to participate in more community events, but I’m worried it might be difficult to keep reaching out to others.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those concerns. Let’s talk about how we can make that process easier for you. What kind of social activities appeal to you the most right now?

User: I enjoy activities like dancing and singing. Perhaps I could look for more dance classes or community music events, but I’m not sure how to find them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in activities you enjoy can make socializing feel less daunting. How about we brainstorm some ways to find these opportunities together? 

User: That sounds helpful. I could ask around in the park or check out community boards. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking in your usual spot is a great start. Also, many communities have online platforms where you can find events. Would you feel comfortable exploring that option?

User: Yes, I think I could manage that. I just need to overcome the initial awkwardness of reaching out.

Consultant: It's normal to feel awkward, but remember your positive experience from the festival. What’s one small step you could take this week to start reconnecting socially?

User: Maybe I could visit the park and ask about dance classes, or just strike up a conversation with someone.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Small, manageable steps often lead to greater changes. How do you think you’ll feel afterward?

User: I might feel a bit anxious, but also relieved to have taken the step. 

Consultant: Yes, acknowledging that anxiety is a part of it is important. Afterward, you can reflect on your experience. What were some things that went well? 

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself for trying, even if it’s just a small conversation. 

Consultant: Exactly! Building on these accomplishments can create a positive feedback loop. Looking ahead, how do you think you can continue to build these connections?

User: I could set a goal to attend at least one new event each month. That sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting a specific goal gives you something to look forward to. What types of events would you like to include in that plan?

User: Besides community events, I might also look for classes that align with my hobbies, like gardening or art.

Consultant: Perfect! Engaging in hobbies you love will likely help you to connect with others who share similar interests. How will you motivate yourself to stick to this plan?

User: I could remind myself of the joy I felt at the festival. Maybe keep a journal to track my experiences.

Consultant: Using a journal is a fantastic idea! It’s a way to reflect and celebrate your victories, no matter how small. How do you feel about your plan moving forward?

User: I'm feeling more hopeful about it. I like having a concrete plan rather than just ideas in my head.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Having a solid plan can make it feel more achievable. What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you as you work on this?

User: I think it might be the fear of rejection. I worry that not everyone will be welcoming.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have that fear. If you encounter challenges, how could you remind yourself of the positive experiences you've had so far?

User: I could reflect on the feedback from the festival, and remember that not every interaction has to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Staying focused on your achievements can help mitigate that fear. Let’s summarize today: you’ve identified specific activities, set a goal, and have strategies to encourage social interaction. How do you feel about your progress?

User: I feel encouraged and excited! I didn’t realize how much I could achieve just by planning.

Consultant: You might surprise yourself with how much you can accomplish. Remember, being open to new relationships can lead to wonderful experiences. If you need to discuss things further, I’m just a conversation away. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to exploring these new connections.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep in touch with these goals, and remember to celebrate each step you take. Have a great week ahead!

User: I will! Thank you again for your help. I’m feeling more optimistic about the coming days.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I've started meeting with some new friends from the community activities, and I'm really enjoying it. It feels nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you've made some new connections. What does this new social engagement mean for you?

User: It feels like I'm finally opening up a bit. I was quite lonely before, but these meetings are giving me something to look forward to. I hope to continue expanding my social circle.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that you're feeling more open to new relationships. Let’s explore how we can support you in maintaining and building on these connections. What kinds of activities have you been enjoying with your new friends?

User: We usually meet for tea or at the park. Sometimes we talk about our hobbies like gardening or reading. I really enjoy these moments.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities! They not only foster connection but also allow you to share your interests. Have you thought about any additional activities that could help you meet even more people?

User: Maybe I could join a local book club or a gardening group. That way, I can meet people who share my interests more closely.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Joining groups can provide a reliable structure for socializing. How do you feel about taking that next step to join a book club or a gardening group?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, to be honest. What if I don't fit in or the group doesn’t welcome me?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about meeting new people. Let’s challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that you wouldn't fit in? Could there be other possible outcomes?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have any strong evidence. I just worry about being rejected. Maybe they will be warm and welcoming.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re recognizing those thoughts. How would you respond if a friend of yours was feeling the same way about joining a new group? What would you tell them?

User: I suppose I would tell them to give it a try and see how it goes. They might have a great experience!

Consultant: Exactly! So, why can't you remind yourself of that advice when thinking about joining a new group? Would you be willing to give it a try?

User: Yes, I think I can manage that. Maybe I’ll visit a book club next week and see how it feels.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Just remember that it’s a chance to explore and meet new people. If it doesn't go well, you always have the option to try something different. 

User: I feel a bit excited now, thinking about it! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It’s important to maintain that excitement. How else do you plan to nurture your current friendships to make them stronger?

User: I could invite some of them over for tea. I think sharing a meal is a great way to bond.

Consultant: Inviting them over sounds like a lovely idea! Sharing food can create a warm atmosphere. What do you think you might prepare for them?

User: I could make some of my favorite pastries. They always seem to enjoy them!

Consultant: That sounds delightful! Cooking for others can be a wonderful way to show you care and strengthen relationships. How does the thought of hosting make you feel?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but mostly excited! I just hope they have a good time.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions. Just remember, the goal is to enjoy time together. You can focus on the pleasure of each other's company rather than aiming for perfection. 

User: You’re right. I’ll try to focus on the enjoyment rather than stressing over details.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! How do you think engaging with friends in this way will impact your feelings of loneliness that you experienced before?

User: I believe it will help a lot. The more I connect with them, the less lonely I’ll feel. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and every positive experience will reinforce your motivation to continue connecting with others. Let’s summarize some of what you’ve planned today, so you can refer back to it later on.

User: Sure! I plan to visit the book club next week, invite friends over for tea, and keep nurturing my current friendships.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic and actionable plan! Remember that you’re building a supportive network which can greatly enhance your well-being. How confident do you feel about these plans?

User: I feel more confident now that we've discussed it. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made great progress in addressing your feelings of loneliness. Remember, I’m here if you need any support as you take these next steps.

User: Thank you so much! I'm thankful for our conversations. I definitely feel more prepared now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth. Let’s schedule our next session to check in on your experiences and any new feelings that may arise. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds great! I’ll see you then.

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, and enjoy your gatherings!
