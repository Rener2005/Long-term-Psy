Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've still been really anxious about everything. With school starting up again and my friends talking about their plans for the future, I just feel more and more overwhelmed. I also noticed that I’m getting jealous of them. 

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety, especially with your peers discussing their futures. Can you tell me more about those feelings? What specifically makes you feel that way?

User: Well, I see my friends getting internships or making plans, and I feel like I’m just not doing enough. It makes me feel inadequate and really lonely since I’ve been isolating myself more. 

Consultant: It seems like comparing yourself to your friends is intensifying your feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. How about your interactions with your roommates? Have they changed in any way that might be contributing to how you feel?

User: Yes, the atmosphere in the dorm has been pretty tense. I've been pulling away from my roommates because I just get frustrated seeing them being so motivated. It’s like I can't even join in their conversations without feeling bad about myself.

Consultant: That makes sense, pulling away could be your way of coping with those feelings. Let's explore what thoughts run through your mind when you're feeling frustrated or jealous. What comes to mind during those moments?

User: I think things like, “Why can’t I be like them?” or “I’ll never find a good job.” It feels like everyone is moving forward while I'm stuck. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense, and it’s understandable how they could lead to feeling stuck and overwhelmed. Can we try to challenge one of those thoughts? For instance, is there any evidence that supports the idea that you will never find a good job?

User: I guess not really. I mean, I have my skills and interests, but it just feels that way when I’m comparing myself to others. 

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that comparison can distort our perception of reality. Instead, what if we look at your skills and interests in a more positive light? What are some strengths you believe you possess?

User: I think I’m good at working with people and I’m creative. But I’m still worried about whether those will be enough to get me a job.

Consultant: Those are valuable strengths! Remember, many employers value creativity and interpersonal skills. What would it look like for you to focus on those strengths instead of what others are doing?

User: I suppose if I focused on those, I might feel more motivated to engage in activities that showcase my abilities, like joining clubs or volunteering. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in those activities might also help improve your social connections. Have you thought about any specific clubs or activities you might want to explore?

User: I think I’d like to join some community service groups. I’ve been wanting to give back, and that might help me connect with others too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Volunteering not only allows you to give back but also creates opportunities for connection and support. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a little excited but also nervous about meeting new people. What if I don't fit in?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about new situations. But remember, many people feel the same way when joining new groups. What if we brainstorm some coping strategies to help you prepare for those interactions?

User: I think having a few conversation starters in mind could help. Also, maybe I should remind myself that it's okay to be myself.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Having conversation starters can ease some of the anxiety. And reminding yourself that being yourself is enough will help you feel more authentic in those interactions. 

User: Yes, I like that idea! I need to work on being more confident in who I am.

Consultant: Building confidence takes time and practice, but you’re already taking important steps. How about we set a small goal for our next session? Perhaps you could try attending one community service event before we meet again?

User: That sounds manageable. I’ll try to attend one event. I really want to push myself out there more.

Consultant: That’s an excellent commitment! I believe this will be a great opportunity for you to connect with others and focus on your strengths. We can discuss how it went in our next session. 

User: I'm looking forward to it! Thanks for helping me process everything.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Remember, it's okay to feel a bit uncomfortable as you make these changes. You’re doing great work here. I look forward to hearing about your experience next time!

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again today! I remember we talked about your academic pressure and the challenges you're facing with communication with your roommate. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite overwhelmed. The pressure from my studies is getting heavier, and I still haven’t resolved my issues with my roommate. I feel really isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious and isolated due to these pressures. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing that overwhelm with your studies?

User: I have a lot of assignments piling up, and I'm not sure how to manage my time effectively. I keep thinking that I might fail if I don't get everything done perfectly.

Consultant: I can see how that might contribute to your feelings of anxiety. It seems like there’s a lot of pressure to perform perfectly. What thoughts do you have when you consider the possibility of not meeting those expectations?

User: I often think I would disappoint myself, my family, and my friends. It feels like if I don't succeed, it would ruin my future.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. These thoughts can certainly add to your anxiety. If a friend were in your position, what advice do you think you would give them about such feelings?

User: I’d probably tell them to take a step back, breathe, and not be so hard on themselves. But I find it hard to take my own advice.

Consultant: That's a common experience. It’s much easier to be compassionate towards others. What if we explored some strategies to help you take that advice yourself? Perhaps we can find ways to break down your tasks and create a more manageable plan.

User: That would be helpful! I just don’t know where to start. 

Consultant: How about we identify the most pressing assignments and prioritize them? We can also incorporate some relaxation techniques that might help you manage your anxiety as you work on them. What do you think?

User: I think that sounds good. I definitely need to feel a little less anxious while studying.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by listing out your assignments. Then we can discuss how to prioritize them based on deadlines and importance. Would you be willing to share what assignments are currently on your plate?

User: Sure! I have a research paper due in two weeks, a group project that needs to be started, and a few smaller assignments due next week.

Consultant: That gives us a clear picture. It sounds like the research paper is your biggest task coming up. Would it make sense to focus on that first and set specific goals for each day? 

User: Yes, that sounds good! I could set a goal to outline it this week.

Consultant: Excellent! Setting a clear goal like that can help you feel more accomplished and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about updating your roommate about your workload as well? That could help bridge the communication gap.

User: I’ve been avoiding that. I feel like she might not understand or think I’m making excuses.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but clear communication may help improve your relationship. Would you like to practice how you can approach that conversation?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to express how I'm feeling without sounding defensive.

Consultant: Perfect! Start with something like, “I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with my studies lately, and I want to make sure we’re okay.” This opens the door for an honest discussion. How does that sound? 

User: That sounds really respectful. I think I could do that.

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! Remember, it’s okay to express your feelings. How do you feel now about the idea of talking to her?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I’m realizing that I need to reach out, even if it’s uncomfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that first step can lead to more support. After you have this conversation, we can discuss how it went and what other strategies might help your relationship with her.

User: Yes, I’ll try to talk to her and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! As for managing your academic pressure, let’s also discuss some techniques you can use whenever you feel overwhelmed. Would you like to try a relaxation exercise or perhaps set some coping strategies you can use?

User: A relaxation exercise sounds awesome! I think that would help a lot.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breathing. Find a comfortable position, and let’s practice this: breathe in deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four, and then exhale through your mouth for four counts. Let’s try that a few times together.

User: Okay, I’m ready. (User practices the breathing exercise.) 

Consultant: How was that for you? Did you feel any difference in your body or mind?

User: Yes, I feel a bit calmer now. Just focusing on my breath really helps.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating this technique into your routine can be very beneficial. Let’s set a goal for you to practice this daily, especially during study sessions.

User: I can definitely do that!

Consultant: Fantastic! As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies we've discussed for managing both your academic pressure and your relationship with your roommate?

User: I feel a lot better! I have a plan now to tackle my assignments and a way to improve communication with my roommate. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s important to be kind to yourself during this busy time. You are making progress, and we can continue to navigate this together in our next session. If you need anything before then, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: I will! Thank you for all your help today. 

Consultant: You’re most welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I appreciate you coming in for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling both relieved and anxious. I’ve been thinking a lot about my career path lately, especially now that I'm about to start my second year.

Consultant: I see, so there’s a mix of relief and ongoing anxiety about your career choices as you transition into the next stage of your studies. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been causing you anxiety?

User: I participated in a school psychological counseling activity recently, which helped me understand myself better. But it also made me question whether I’m on the right career path. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel uncertain after gaining new insights about yourself. What aspects of your career path are you questioning the most? 

User: I guess I’m worried that I might not choose a career that aligns with my interests and abilities. I don’t want to end up in a job that I find unfulfilling.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. Wanting to find a fulfilling career is important. Have you had specific interests or abilities come to mind that you feel drawn to pursue? 

User: I like art and design, but I’m not sure if I’m good enough to make a career out of it, and I also worry about job stability.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a passion for art and design but are struggling with doubts about your skills and the practicality of such a career. How do those doubts affect your confidence in pursuing that path?

User: They make me hesitant to commit to it. I often think I should choose a more stable and conventional career instead.

Consultant: It’s understandable to weigh stability against your passions. Let’s explore this a bit more. When you think about a conventional career, what kind of fields or roles come to your mind? 

User: I usually think about things like business or law; they seem more secure, but I’m not very excited about them.

Consultant: It’s common to prioritize security, especially in today’s job market. However, you mentioned a lack of excitement with those options. What can we do to bridge the gap between your interests in art and the desire for security?

User: I’ve thought about doing something related to design but in areas that combine it with business. I don’t know how that looks in reality, though.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, to blend your interest in design with business! There are many roles, like marketing or brand management, that utilize creativity. Would you like to explore how you could potentially pursue this path?

User: Yes, that sounds interesting, but I’m not sure where to start. 

Consultant: Let’s break it down. We can assess your skills related to both fields and see how they might connect. What are some skills you have or would want to develop for a career in design and business?

User: I’m good at communicating and have some technical skills in design software. But I think I need more knowledge about business concepts.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills! Learning more about business concepts could complement your existing design abilities. Would you consider taking classes or seeking resources that help you blend both interests?

User: I think that could be a good idea. I’ll at least look into it.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Researching courses will give you a clearer idea of what’s available. How are you feeling about this plan now?

User: I feel a little more hopeful, but I still worry about how to balance everything while managing my studies.

Consultant: Balancing studies with new learning can be challenging. One approach is to set small, manageable goals. What are some small steps you could take in the next week to begin this blend?

User: Maybe I could start by spending a little time each week learning some business basics online, while still keeping up with my studies.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise plan. Gradually introducing business learning will prevent overwhelm. How does that approach resonate with you? 

User: It feels much more doable this way. I think I can manage that without feeling too stressed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember to check in with yourself regularly to see how you’re feeling about this balance. It's important to allow some reflection time. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I’ll try to do that and see how I cope with this new approach.

Consultant: Excellent! You’re already making progress being proactive about your career path. As we wrap up, what is one thing you feel you’ve taken away from our discussion today?

User: I feel that I have options and can explore ways to combine my interests and skills. It’s nice to feel more hopeful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Recognizing your options is a crucial step. I believe you can maintain that hope as you continue exploring. What steps will you take to reinforce this feeling moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that it’s okay to explore and take my time with these decisions, rather than rush into anything.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset. Remember, it’s all about progress at your own pace. I look forward to seeing how this evolves for you next time we meet! 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance. I appreciate it a lot!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more relieved after talking with my roommate, but I'm still worried about keeping that improvement going.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've experienced some relief. Keeping up that positive communication is important. Can you share a bit about what you discussed with your roommate?

User: We talked about some things that were bothering us, and even though it was a little awkward, it felt good to express my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step! It takes courage to communicate openly. What feelings did you experience during that conversation?

User: I felt nervous at first, but also a little lighter after we talked. I guess I was just glad to finally get things off my chest.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous. It's a sign that you care about the relationship. Moving forward, what do you think would help you maintain this level of communication with your roommate?

User: I think I need to practice being more open and not let my worries get in the way. It's just hard sometimes.

Consultant: You're acknowledging that it can be challenging, which is a great first step. Would you be willing to explore some specific strategies to help you practice this openness in future conversations?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I want to feel more confident when talking to her.

Consultant: Wonderful! One approach we can use is role-playing. How about we simulate a conversation where you express your feelings about a specific topic?

User: Sure! I can try that. Maybe I can talk about how I feel about school and our living situation.

Consultant: That sounds like a good start. Let's imagine you’re about to have that conversation. What might you say first?

User: I might say something like, “Hey, can we talk about how things are going in our room? I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately.”

Consultant: That’s a great opening! It’s clear and direct. How do you think your roommate might respond to that?

User: I think she might say something like, “Yeah, I’ve noticed you seem stressed. Do you want to share more about it?”

Consultant: Exactly. That opens the door to a deeper conversation. If she responds like that, how would you feel about sharing your worries?

User: I’d feel relieved, but I might still hesitate a bit.

Consultant: That’s understandable. One way to reduce that hesitation is to prepare some specific things you want to share. What are some particular worries you’d like to mention?

User: I guess I’m worried about balancing my studies and having a social life. It feels like there's too much to handle.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, especially as you move into your second year. You could say something like, “I feel overwhelmed by my studies and struggle to find time to relax with friends.” Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, it does. If I say that, I think it might help my roommate understand what I'm going through.

Consultant: Precisely! Expressing those specific feelings can lead to more supportive conversations. Can you think of other topics related to your life that might be worth discussing?

User: Maybe about setting boundaries when it comes to study time and personal time. I don't want to neglect my studies, but I also need my downtime.

Consultant: That’s an excellent topic. Boundaries are essential. You might say to your roommate, “I want to make sure I have time for both studying and relaxing. Maybe we can work together on a schedule.” How does that sound to you?

User: I think that sounds good. It’s a practical way to approach it.

Consultant: Yes! Practical steps can make discussions feel more manageable. Now, how do you feel about approaching this conversation with your roommate after practicing this role-play?

User: I feel a bit more equipped and less anxious about it. It's nice to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan boosts your confidence. In our next session, we can discuss how your conversation goes and any follow-up actions you might take.

User: That sounds great! I’m looking forward to sharing how it goes.

Consultant: Perfect! Before we end today, let’s briefly summarize what we’ve worked on. You’ve identified your concerns and practiced opening the conversation with your roommate, emphasizing expressing your feelings and setting boundaries.

User: Yes, and I feel more prepared to connect with her now.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, maintaining this communication is a journey. It’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you encounter any challenges, we can address them together.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I’m confident you’ll do great. If any thoughts or questions come up before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. How are you feeling about your career plans after our last discussion?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit more settled after talking with my family about my career path. However, I still have some anxiety about making concrete plans for my future.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's good to hear that your family is supportive. What specific aspects of your plans make you feel anxious? 

User: I guess it's just the uncertainty of everything. I’m worried about whether I’ll make the right choices and what my job prospects will look like once I graduate.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel uncertain about the future, especially with such important decisions ahead. Let’s explore how you can create a more defined plan. What are some initial steps you can take to clarify your career goals?

User: I think I could start by researching potential career paths related to my major. I also want to talk to my academic advisor for guidance.

Consultant: Those sound like great first steps! Researching career paths can give you a clearer picture, and your academic advisor can offer valuable insights. How do you feel about setting a specific deadline for these tasks? 

User: Setting a deadline might help me focus. Maybe I could try to complete my research by the end of next week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How about the meeting with your academic advisor? When do you think you could arrange that?

User: I could try to schedule that for next week as well, right after I finish my research. 

Consultant: That sounds very organized! Having both tasks lined up can help build your momentum. What are your thoughts on how these steps will affect your anxiety about the future?

User: I think having a plan will definitely ease some of my anxiety. Knowing I’m doing something proactive makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you recognize the connection between action and feeling more in control. Let's talk about your family support—how can you involve them in this process to further reduce your anxiety?

User: I could share my research findings with them and ask for their opinions. They often give me great advice, and I value their input.

Consultant: Involving your family sounds like a beneficial idea. Their support can provide different perspectives and reassurance. Would you feel comfortable sharing your plan with them as well?

User: Yes, I think that's a good idea. It would also make me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your plan can help strengthen your support system. Let's summarize what you've decided: researching career paths, meeting with your advisor, and involving your family. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it. It’s manageable and gives me a clearer direction.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let's dig a little deeper into any underlying thoughts you have regarding your career choices. Are there any particular beliefs or worries that come to mind?

User: Sometimes I worry that I won't be as successful as my peers. It's hard not to compare myself to them.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, but these thoughts can often fuel anxiety. What evidence do you have that supports this worry? 

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence. It's more about how I perceive everyone's lives on social media.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Social media can really distort our perception of reality. How might you challenge these comparison thoughts?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of my strengths and achievements instead of focusing on others.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Listing your strengths can help shift the focus back to your personal journey. What could be a small action step you can take to reinforce this mindset? 

User: I could start journaling about my accomplishments and things I’m proud of daily.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent idea! It can keep you grounded and remind you of your unique path. How do you feel about trying this for a week? 

User: I think I can manage that! It feels more empowering to focus on what I can control. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Empowerment is key. As we wrap up our session, let’s revisit the actions you’re taking and your reflection on the process. What are your main takeaways from our conversation today?

User: I’m realizing that having a structured plan and involving my family can help reduce my anxiety. I also want to be more aware of the negative thoughts I have about comparing myself to others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! You are taking significant steps, and it’s great to see you building confidence in your ability to manage your emotions. Remember, it's okay to have feelings of anxiety; acknowledging and confronting them helps you grow.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I'm feeling more equipped to face my career decisions.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I truly believe in your ability to navigate this journey. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! I'm really looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about your progress in emotional management and interpersonal skills?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good. I’ve become more confident in managing my emotions, and I feel like my social skills have improved a lot. But I still worry a bit about what’s ahead in my studies and future job prospects.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you feel more confident! It seems you’ve made some significant progress. Let’s talk about those worries regarding your studies and future. What specifically concerns you the most at this moment?

User: I think it’s mostly about where I’ll end up after graduation. There’s so much pressure about finding a good job, especially as I’m going into my second year now. I feel like I need to have everything figured out, which is stressful.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that kind of pressure, especially when thinking about your future career. It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed by the expectations. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you think about needing to have everything figured out?

User: I often think that if I don’t have a solid plan, I’ll fall behind my peers. Sometimes I catch myself thinking that I’m not good enough to succeed in the job market.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some very critical thoughts regarding your readiness for the future and your self-worth. When you think, "I'm not good enough," what kind of feelings does that evoke in you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and a bit defeated. I start to doubt my abilities and question whether I’ll find a job after graduation.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like those thoughts are causing you significant anxiety and self-doubt. Let’s explore those thoughts—what evidence do you have to support the idea that you’re not good enough for the job market?

User: I guess I don’t really have specific evidence, it’s more of a feeling. I compare myself to others who seem to be more accomplished or are already getting internships, and it makes me feel behind.

Consultant: Comparing yourself to others can indeed fuel feelings of inadequacy. If a friend was feeling this way, what would you tell them about their progress and unique journey?

User: I’d probably remind them that everyone has their path and that it’s okay to take things at my own pace.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective! It’s important to recognize that everyone has different timelines. How might you apply this advice to yourself when those feelings of doubt arise?

User: I could remind myself to focus on my own strengths and achievements, rather than comparing myself to others. It’s just hard to do in the moment.

Consultant: It definitely can be challenging. Would you like to create some strategies together that can help you shift your focus to your strengths when you find yourself feeling inadequate?

User: Yes, that would help! I want to feel more assured and less anxious about my future.

Consultant: Great! One idea is to keep a journal where you write down your achievements and positive feedback you receive from others. This way, you can remind yourself of your progress. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds like a good idea! Writing down my accomplishments might help reinforce my self-esteem.

Consultant: I think so too! Additionally, what if we set some small, achievable goals regarding your studies or career exploration? This might help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by the future. 

User: Yes, setting smaller goals could make it seem less daunting. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s outline a few small goals you can work towards over the next month. What’s one area related to your studies or career that you could focus on first?

User: I could look into potential internships or volunteer opportunities related to my field. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent first step! Researching internships and volunteer opportunities could give you valuable experience and help alleviate some of that anxiety about the future. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel excited about it! It seems like a proactive way to gain more confidence.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Active steps can often create a positive feedback loop for your self-confidence. Let’s also talk about maintaining your emotional balance while you take these steps. What strategies have you found helpful so far in managing your anxiety?

User: I have been practicing some breathing exercises, and they help sometimes, but I think I could benefit from more structured activities.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Breathing exercises are very effective. We might also consider adding some physical activities or hobbies that you enjoy into your routine. These can be excellent outlets for reducing stress. What do you think?

User: I love dancing but haven’t been doing it much lately. Incorporating that back into my routine sounds perfect!

Consultant: Dancing could be a wonderful way to express yourself and release tension. It’s a form of physical activity that can lift your mood. How about setting aside some time each week for dancing?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely commit to that! I think it will really help me manage my feelings better.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Now, just to briefly summarize your plans: you’ll start a journal to track your achievements, explore internships or volunteer opportunities, and incorporate dancing back into your routine. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really good! I feel much more focused and optimistic about the coming weeks.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you’re feeling focused and optimistic! You’ve made some impressive insights and plans today. As we wrap up, I’d like you to reflect on what you feel is your main takeaway from our session today.

User: I think my main takeaway is that I don’t have to overwhelm myself with anxiety about the future. I can take things one step at a time and appreciate my unique journey.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful takeaway! Remember that it’s perfectly okay to take your journey at your own pace. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, revisit today’s strategies. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help, and I feel more equipped to deal with my worries now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Today’s session is a great step towards maintaining your emotional balance. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time!
