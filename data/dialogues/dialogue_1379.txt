Consultant: Hi Yang! I'm glad to see you again today. I know it’s been a tough time for you lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind since our last session?

User: Hi. Things have been pretty rough. The anniversary of my father's death just passed, and it brought back a lot of feelings. I've been having more vivid hallucinations and feeling really scared, like people around me are watching me with hostility.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that, Yang. It’s understandable that the anniversary of your father's passing would trigger such strong emotions. You mentioned feeling scared and experiencing hallucinations—can you tell me more about what those experiences are like for you?

User: Sometimes I hear voices that I can't explain. They tell me things that make me anxious, and I feel like I can't trust anyone around me. It’s like everyone is plotting against me.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly distressing. It’s important to acknowledge how overwhelming that must feel. Let's talk about those voices—can you recall what specific thoughts they express or what situations seem to trigger them?

User: They often criticize me or remind me of my failures. I can’t pinpoint exact situations, but whenever I'm alone, they seem stronger. I feel increasingly paranoid, especially in crowded places.

Consultant: It sounds like being alone amplifies those negative thoughts and the paranoia. Have there been moments when you’ve noticed a clear connection between those thoughts and your feelings of fear or anxiety?

User: Yes, definitely. When I start to feel anxious, the voices come back stronger, telling me that I'm in danger or that someone is out to get me. It's like they feed off my fear.

Consultant: It makes sense that your anxiety would influence those voices, creating a cycle that’s hard to break. What do you think might happen if you try to challenge some of those negative thoughts when they arise?

User: I’ve tried doing that, but it’s really tough. Sometimes I just feel paralyzed by fear. I don’t know what to believe anymore.

Consultant: That’s completely valid, Yang. It’s a difficult place to be in. Maybe we can think about some grounding techniques that could help you distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t when you experience those fears. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful, but I worry that it won’t work. What if I can’t tell the difference?

Consultant: I understand your concern. It can be hard to shift those thoughts when you’re feeling overwhelmed. What if we started with small steps? For example, we could identify a few grounding exercises you can try when those thoughts arise, and see how you feel afterwards.

User: Okay, I’d be willing to try that. What kinds of exercises do you have in mind?

Consultant: One technique is to focus on your surrounding environment. You could try describing five things you can see around you, four things you can touch, three sounds you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help anchor you in the present moment. Would you be open to practicing that?

User: I've never tried that before, but I think it might help. I get so lost in my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! The more you practice, the easier it will become. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain at first. You’re actively working towards understanding and managing your experiences, and that takes courage.

User: Thank you. I do want to feel more in control, especially when the hallucinations hit.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can work towards that together. Also, the next time you notice a specific hallucination, could you try to write it down? That way, we can discuss it in our next session and identify any patterns together.

User: I can do that. It helps to have a plan. I hope it will make things clearer.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a plan helps to give you a sense of control over the situation. Remember, every small step you take is a step towards managing these experiences better.

User: I feel a bit better just talking about all this. It's relieving to share.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Yang. And I’m here to listen anytime. It's important to express what you're going through. How are you feeling about our session today overall?

User: I feel like I have some tools now to challenge my thoughts. I still feel scared, but I have hope.

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! It’s okay to have mixed feelings. It's all part of the process. As we continue, we’ll build on those tools and work on strengthening your reality testing skills.

User: That makes sense. I appreciate the encouragement. 

Consultant: Of course! Your willingness to share and work through these experiences is commendable. As we wrap up today, let’s review what you can focus on until our next session. 

User: I’ll try the grounding exercises and write down my thoughts. I'm feeling a bit more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keep practicing, and remember, you’re not alone in this. If anything feels overwhelming, it’s okay to reach out for support.

User: Thank you for being here for me. I feel a little less isolated now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang. I look forward to seeing you next time. Remember, it’s a journey, and every step you take matters. Take care until then!

User: I will. See you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Yang. I'm really glad you're here today. I know it's been a tough time for you recently with the upcoming school event. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed and scared. The stress from the upcoming activities just makes my hallucinations worse, and sometimes I can't tell what's real anymore.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing, Yang. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with the pressure, especially with your history. Let’s talk about these hallucinations you're experiencing. When do you notice them happening most?

User: They usually come when I’m trying to focus on my studies or when I’m in a crowded place. It feels like there are voices telling me things that make me panic.

Consultant: I see. So, it seems that both studying and crowded situations trigger these feelings for you. What kinds of thoughts or feelings come up when those voices start?

User: I start to think that no one cares about me, and that I'm a failure. It makes me feel really alone and hopeless.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and overwhelming. It's important to recognize them. Can you recall what specific events might be a trigger for these feelings? 

User: I think the recent loss of my father and the breakup I went through might be influencing these feelings. Just the thought of those memories makes everything worse when I'm stressed.

Consultant: Those are significant losses, Yang, and it makes sense that they could impact how you feel now, especially in stressful situations. Let's explore how those feelings connect with the current stress. How do you think the upcoming event is impacting you specifically?

User: I guess I'm afraid I’ll embarrass myself. The pressure to perform is enormous, and it just adds to the feeling that I can't manage everything.

Consultant: It sounds like the fear of not meeting expectations is a big part of it. What evidence do you have that you would embarrass yourself or fail? 

User: I don’t really have any concrete evidence, but when I hear those voices, it feels real. They make me doubt myself.

Consultant: That doubt can be really powerful, especially when combined with stress. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about these thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel stressed and that they shouldn't believe those negative thoughts about themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate view to take. So, what if we tried treating your thoughts like you would with a friend's? What if we looked for alternative explanations for those voices and feelings?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that those voices don’t represent the truth. They’re just a part of my condition.

Consultant: Exactly, Yang! Recognizing that those thoughts aren't facts can help. What if we brainstormed some strategies to cope when these triggers arise, especially during stressful situations?

User: That would be helpful. Maybe I can plan for breaks during studying to manage my stress better.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Taking breaks can definitely help. Are there any specific activities or techniques you find relaxing that could fit into those breaks?

User: I like listening to music, but sometimes I feel too anxious even to do that.

Consultant: How about starting with just a few minutes? Music can help ground you. When you feel the urge to withdraw or get overwhelmed, perhaps setting a timer for a short music break could be beneficial.

User: That sounds doable. I could also practice some breathing exercises.

Consultant: Breathing exercises are excellent! They can help center you when you feel anxious. Let’s also discuss how you can gradually expose yourself to crowded situations in a controlled way, starting small. What do you think about that?

User: I could try going to quieter places first, maybe starting with a small group of friends.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Gradually increasing your exposure makes it more manageable. Would you be willing to set a specific goal for this week regarding this?

User: I can try to spend at least an hour in a local café where it’s quieter, just to get used to being around people again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Checking in with yourself during that experience can help you recognize how you’re feeling and apply those coping strategies. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It feels good to have some steps to take instead of just being overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Yang. Remember, it's about taking one step at a time. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you've made in understanding your triggers. Do you feel clearer about how pressure influences your symptoms now?

User: Yes, I think I understand better. I see how my stress is tied to my feelings and thoughts, especially in difficult situations.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. For our next session, why don’t you think about how the strategies we discussed worked for you? We can explore what went well and what adjustments we might need to make.

User: I will do that. Thank you for helping me see a way forward.

Consultant: You're welcome, Yang. It's been great working with you today. Remember, you're not alone in this, and I’m here to support you. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm a bit confused. I attended that mental health seminar, and now I'm questioning whether I really have a mental illness. My father's death and my past relationship really hit hard, but I'm not sure that I have schizophrenia.

Consultant: I see. You're navigating some complex feelings and doubts about your diagnosis. It sounds like the seminar has sparked some questions for you. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings have come up since then?

User: I just keep thinking, maybe I don't really have schizophrenia. I mean, I occasionally hear things, but could that just be stress or something else? 

Consultant: It's completely normal to question your diagnosis, especially after learning more about mental health. What you're experiencing can be influenced by many factors, including grief and stress. Can you describe how these thoughts about your diagnosis make you feel?

User: It’s frustrating, honestly. Sometimes I feel like I just want to let go of any labels and live my life. Other times, I get concerned that I'm not addressing a real problem.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. You're caught between wanting to shed the label and fearing that it might hide a deeper issue. Let's explore your feelings a bit more. When you think about living your life without that label, what does that look like for you?

User: I imagine being able to study better, socialize more, and not have this looming feeling of something being 'wrong' with me. But then, on the flip side, when I hear things, it makes me feel like I should take it seriously.

Consultant: It seems like a significant part of you wants to move forward, while another part feels the need to take precautions based on your experiences. Can you recall a specific moment when you heard something, and how you reacted at that time?

User: Just the other day, I was studying, and I heard someone calling my name. I looked around, but no one was there. It caught me off guard, and I started doubting myself again.

Consultant: That must have felt really disorienting. Hearing your name when you're alone could understandably bring up questions about your mental state. How did that experience affect your emotions afterwards?

User: It made me anxious. I couldn’t concentrate on my studying after that, and I felt like I was spiraling back to a dark place.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that, Yang. It's understandable to feel anxious after such an experience. Let's consider how you can manage those feelings in the moment. What strategies, if any, have you tried before to cope when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I usually try to distract myself with music or videos, but I often return to that spiral of doubt and confusion.

Consultant: Distracting yourself can be a helpful short-term strategy, but it sounds like it's not addressing the underlying feelings. Would you be open to discussing some techniques that could help you manage those doubts and anxieties more effectively?

User: Yes, I think that would be beneficial. I want to understand how to confront those feelings without letting them overwhelm me.

Consultant: Great! One approach we can consider is identifying and challenging those negative thoughts when they arise. For instance, when you think "I'm not really sick," what evidence do you have to support or challenge that thought?

User: I guess there are times I feel completely normal, or I can think logically. But then there are moments that seem so real that I can’t agree with the rational side of my thoughts.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that your experience can be valid even while your thoughts fluctuate. What if we explore some alternative thoughts you could hold onto when those moments of doubt strike? For example, could you say, "I have moments of clarity, and that doesn't negate my experience"?

User: That sounds reasonable. It might help to remind myself that clarity is possible and that I can have both experiences without being completely defined by one.

Consultant: Exactly! Finding that balance can be empowering. The next time you experience doubts, practicing grounding thoughts like that can help you regain your sense of control. What do you think about that?

User: I like that idea. It feels like I’m taking some power back instead of just reacting to my feelings.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we move forward, how about we also discuss some techniques to reduce the impact of those challenges? For instance, we could explore establishing a routine or engaging in mindfulness practices. Would you be interested in that?

User: Yes, routines sound helpful. I could try to create some stability amidst the chaos.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can definitely help foster a sense of stability. We can also incorporate mindfulness, which is simply being present in the moment without judgment. This might help you observe your emotions more clearly without getting overwhelmed by them. How do you feel about trying some mindfulness exercises together?

User: I’m open to it. I could use anything that helps calm my mind and focus.

Consultant: Wonderful! One simple exercise involves focusing on your breath for a few minutes daily. We can practice that now, if you'd like, or I can guide you through it in our next session if you prefer to prepare.

User: Let's try it now. I’m curious how it feels.

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll guide you through. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a moment, then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this for a few moments together. Feel the sensations of your breath, and bring your mind back if it starts to wander. 

User: I feel a bit calmer already. It’s nice to focus on something simple.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Yang! Focusing on your breath can be a powerful tool. As we continue this journey, let's remember to incorporate these practices to help you manage those anxious moments. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I’m starting to see some possible ways to handle everything better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's all about taking small steps towards feeling more in control of your mental state. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. What do you feel is the most important insight you’ve gained from our discussion?

User: I think understanding that I can approach my thoughts differently and recognizing that it’s okay to have doubts without being defined by them.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a valuable insight, and I hope you carry that thought with you. Remember, this process takes time, and it’s okay to seek help whenever needed. If you have questions about medication or feel uncertain at any point, we can discuss that next time. Just know you’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you, I appreciate that. I will think over what we discussed. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang. I look forward to our next session. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in between.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're back for today's session. I understand there have been some ups and downs with your medication treatment. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi. I still have my doubts about the medication. Some days I feel alright, but then I get these huge emotional swings. I just don’t know if it's the medicine causing it or something else.

Consultant: It's perfectly understandable to feel uncertain, especially when your emotions are fluctuating. Let’s talk about those swings you experience. Can you describe a recent time when you felt your emotions change suddenly?

User: Well, just yesterday, I was doing fine in the morning, but by afternoon, I felt really low. I just sat in my room and didn't want to do anything. It’s like one minute I'm okay, and the next I’m feeling hopeless.

Consultant: That sounds very overwhelming, Yang. Feeling good one moment and then low the next can be really frustrating. What thoughts were going through your mind during that low period?

User: I remember thinking that maybe I'll never feel like myself again or that I can't handle all this change. It’s scary.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy, and it's natural to feel scared when you think you might not return to your previous self. Let's explore that a bit. Do you believe there is any evidence that suggests you won't feel like yourself again, or could there be other possibilities?

User: I suppose it’s just hard for me to see a light at the end of the tunnel when things feel so bleak.

Consultant: I hear you. It can be tough to envision brighter days when you're in a low spot. But remember, emotions can be temporary. If a friend were feeling like this, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel bad sometimes and that these feelings will pass. I think I need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Acknowledging that it's okay to feel bad is an important step. It sounds like you have the capacity to comfort yourself, similar to how you would help a friend. How might that change things for you?

User: Maybe if I can keep that in mind, it won't feel so overwhelming. I should give myself some credit for getting through tough times.

Consultant: Absolutely! Giving yourself credit is important. It helps build a positive perspective. Now, regarding your medication, what specific concerns do you have about the side effects? 

User: I worry about feeling more anxious or unstable. Sometimes, I feel like the medication might be making me feel worse instead of better.

Consultant: It's common to have concerns about side effects, especially when managing emotional health. Would it help if we discussed some common side effects associated with your medication and strategies to cope with them?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I just want to understand if it's really worth it or not.

Consultant: That's a good question. Understanding the balance between benefits and side effects can provide clarity. Let’s discuss what you can expect from the medication, both good and bad. 

User: Okay, I think that would make me feel better. I just need more information.

Consultant: Exactly! Information is empowering. Many people experience side effects initially, but they can often stabilize over time. Have you communicated these feelings with your doctor?

User: Not really. I haven’t wanted to bother them with my worries, but maybe I should.

Consultant: Your concerns are valid, and sharing them with your doctor is important for your progress. They can help you adjust your treatment, if necessary. What strengths do you think you have that could help you take that step?

User: I think I'm better at expressing myself now compared to before, so I guess I can use that to talk to my doctor.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Your ability to express your feelings is definitely a strength. As you move forward, how do you feel about gradually reaching out to your social circle again?

User: I’ve been thinking about that, but I’m still a bit anxious. I want to feel comfortable being around people again.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel cautious about re-entering social situations, especially given your experiences. What small steps might you take to ease back into social interactions?

User: Maybe I could start with a few text messages to friends. If I feel good, I could suggest hanging out.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible plan! Texting can be a low-pressure way to reconnect. How do you feel about setting a small goal, like reaching out to one friend this week?

User: That seems doable to me. I could try that and see how I feel.

Consultant: Great to hear! Taking small steps is key. It’s important to celebrate even the tiniest progress. In our next session, we can discuss how that went for you. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think this approach might really help me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling hopeful! Remember, progress takes time, and you're doing better than you think. If you start to feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself that it’s okay to take things one step at a time.

User: I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing how things go. Remember, you're not alone in this. 

User: Yes, I appreciate that. Talk to you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi. I've been doing okay, but I still have moments where I worry about fitting in with others. I want to actively participate in social activities without feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Yang. It sounds like you’re eager to connect more with others, which is a positive step. Can you tell me about any recent social activities you've participated in?

User: Yeah, I joined a couple of clubs at school. It felt good being around people, but I still felt a bit out of place sometimes.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel out of place when meeting new people. You mentioned feeling good at times—can you share what specifically made you feel that way during those activities?

User: When I was talking with others, I felt engaged, and it was nice to share ideas. But then I would worry about what they might think of me.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you experienced moments of engagement! However, it’s also understandable that worries about others' opinions can creep in. What thoughts do you notice when these worries arise?

User: I often think that people see me as different because of my background. It makes me hesitate to express myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with some challenging thoughts in those moments. Have you noticed how these thoughts influence your feelings when you’re in social situations?

User: Yes, they make me feel anxious and self-conscious, which sometimes leads me to avoid conversations.

Consultant: Avoidance can feel like a safe option in the moment, but it might reinforce your worries. Let’s explore reframing those thoughts. What do you think might be a more balanced way to view your situation?

User: Maybe instead of thinking they see me as different, I could consider that they might appreciate my unique experiences.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift in perspective! Recognizing the value in your experiences can be empowering. How do you feel about practicing this thought during your next social interaction?

User: I think I could try that. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Great! We can create a plan for you to gradually engage in social situations while applying this new perspective. What type of social activities do you think you could participate in next?

User: There’s a group meeting next week that I’m thinking of joining. It’s about a project I’m interested in.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent opportunity! Would you be comfortable setting a small goal for participation in that meeting?

User: I’d like to share at least one idea during the discussion. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s an achievable goal, Yang! How do you think you’ll feel if you successfully share your idea?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself and maybe more confident about talking in the future.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each small step can help build your confidence. Let’s also think about how to prepare for nerves on the day of the meeting. What techniques can you use to calm any anxious feelings beforehand?

User: Maybe I could practice some deep breathing or remind myself of the positive thoughts we talked about.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Practicing deep breathing can really help ground you. Would you like to role-play a brief scenario of sharing your idea to build comfort with your plan?

User: Yes, that might help. I’ll give it a shot!

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s imagine you’re in the meeting and the topic comes up. What would you say to introduce your idea?

User: I would say something like, “I have a thought on this topic based on my experience…” 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It feels confident and invites discussion. How does that feel to you, saying that out loud?

User: I felt more confident just saying it here. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yang! Remember, it's about taking those small steps and building gradually. What’s your biggest takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I’ve learned that I can change my thoughts and approach social situations more positively without letting my worries hold me back.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! As you move forward, remember that practice and self-compassion will be key. How do you plan to maintain this mindset in the coming days?

User: I will remind myself of the importance of my experiences and try to participate in more activities.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I’m really proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up, what support would you find helpful from me in our next session?

User: I would appreciate a recap of strategies and maybe checking in on how the group meeting went.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can do that. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences! Until next time, take care and keep practicing those new thoughts.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now and excited to try these things out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling more hopeful about the future, but I still have some worries about getting back to my studies. I'm excited but also anxious about how to manage everything.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful! It’s perfectly normal to feel a mixture of excitement and anxiety when thinking about returning to your studies. Can you tell me more about what specifically about studying is making you anxious?

User: I think I'm worried about whether I can keep up with my classmates and whether I will still struggle with focus like before.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, Yang. Let’s break this down a bit. What does “keeping up” look like for you? What are your classmates doing that makes you feel this way?

User: I see them all being so social and confident in class. I’m afraid I won't be able to participate or that I might feel out of place.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re anxious about fitting in and participating. How do you usually feel during class when you try to engage, or what thoughts come to mind when you think about participating?

User: I often think that everyone is judging me, and that I will make mistakes. This makes me freeze up and not say anything.

Consultant: It’s tough when those thoughts come up, and it sounds like they really hinder you. Can you recall a specific instance when you felt this way in class? What were your thoughts then?

User: Yes, in my last course, I wanted to ask a question, but I kept thinking, “What if they laugh at me?” I just ended up keeping quiet.

Consultant: Let’s examine that thought—what evidence do you have that your classmates would laugh at you? Are there instances that suggest they wouldn’t be supportive?

User: Well, I can’t really think of any. They usually seem friendly, but I just get stuck in my head.

Consultant: That’s important to recognize! Often, our fears can be based on assumptions rather than reality. How would you feel if you could reframe that thought to something more positive, like “My questions are valid, and my classmates might appreciate my curiosity”?

User: That does sound more encouraging. I guess I should focus on wanting to learn rather than worrying about their opinions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus can create a more open mindset. What are some small steps you could take to practice this new way of thinking when you’re in class?

User: Maybe I could start by asking a simple question, or even just saying something when I feel the urge, even if it's just sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Starting small is a great way to build your confidence. How do you feel about implementing that in your upcoming classes?

User: I feel a bit more determined now. It sounds manageable, and I think it could help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also think about how to maintain your mental clarity as you dive back into your studies. Are there any strategies you've thought about to help keep your focus?

User: I think having a study schedule might help me stay organized and more in control, instead of just cramming everything last minute.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A structured study plan can really alleviate stress. What would be a practical approach for you to create that schedule?

User: I could allocate specific times for studying each subject and mix it with breaks. Maybe I'll also add some time for exercise to clear my mind.

Consultant: Great! Balancing study time with exercise is an effective strategy. What kind of exercises are you thinking about incorporating?

User: I enjoy going for runs and maybe some yoga. It helps me feel grounded.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Yang! Running and yoga can both boost your mood and help with focus. Do you feel ready to set a timeframe for when you'll start this study schedule?

User: Yes, I can start next week. I'll set aside specific times in my calendar for both study and exercise.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we discuss your future goals, let’s take a moment to review your mental health toolkit. What have you learned about maintaining your mental wellbeing so far?

User: I’ve learned that recognizing my negative thoughts and challenging them is really important. Also, keeping a balance between study and relaxation seems helpful.

Consultant: Those are insightful reflections! Keeping that awareness and balance is key. How might you remind yourself to apply these techniques in the future?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or write affirmations in my planner to keep me focused on my goals and thoughts.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Affirmations can be a powerful tool for reinforcement. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to address today regarding your plans or feelings?

User: I feel like we've covered a lot, but I’m just grateful for the support. I think I have a clearer direction now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working through your feelings and plans together. Remember, you’re making significant progress, and I believe in your ability to cope and thrive. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate everything. I feel more confident now about moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang! I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. As we conclude today’s session, remember to use those strategies and check in with yourself regularly. If you need support, I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time! 

User: Thank you! I will. Take care!
