Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! Honestly, I’ve been feeling quite anxious. I've had a few social interactions that I thought would go well, but they turned out awkward, and it left me feeling embarrassed.

Consultant: I understand that must have been disappointing for you. Can you tell me more about those interactions? What thoughts went through your mind during those moments?

User: Well, I was just really nervous. I thought to myself that I was going to mess things up, and then I started sweating a lot. I just felt everyone was judging me.

Consultant: It sounds like you were quite stressed. You mentioned thinking that others were judging you—how did that belief make you feel in those moments?

User: It made me feel even worse. I became so self-conscious that I couldn't even focus on what I wanted to say. I just tried to get through it without making a complete fool of myself.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Liu. It’s important to explore those feelings. When you think about people judging you, do you think there’s any evidence for that, or might there be other interpretations?

User: I don’t know… I guess I assume they’re judging me because I feel so inadequate. It’s hard to imagine that anyone could find me likable.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially if you've been carrying them for some time. What do you think might happen if you tried to view those interactions differently—perhaps as chances to learn rather than opportunities to judge yourself?

User: That sounds nice in theory, but I struggle to believe it. I always feel like I’m failing when I’m in those situations.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. Let’s challenge that idea a bit. If a close friend of yours was in a similar situation feeling inadequate, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone feels awkward sometimes. 

Consultant: Exactly! So, if you were to apply that same kindness you would offer a friend to yourself, how would that change your perception during social situations?

User: I suppose it would help me see things in a more relaxed way. I might not feel so pressured to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Liu. Maybe we can practice some techniques together to help you start applying that self-compassion. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I need all the help I can get.

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s think about setting small, achievable goals for social interactions. What would be a small step you feel comfortable taking in a social setting?

User: I think I could start by just saying hi to someone in class. It’s manageable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic step! Simple greetings can be a great way to ease into conversations. How might you feel before and after doing that?

User: Before, I’d probably feel really nervous, but afterward, if it goes well, I might feel a little more confident.

Consultant: Precisely! It’s all about gradual exposure. After you greet someone, how about reflecting on that experience? What thoughts would you like to focus on afterward?

User: I guess I would focus on the fact that I took the step to engage and try not to be too hard on myself if it wasn’t perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You’re shifting from self-criticism to self-reflection, which is so crucial. How do you feel about trying this out before our next session?

User: I’m nervous, but I really want to work on this. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember, this is a learning process. You’re not alone in this. Just take it one step at a time.

User: Right. I’ll try to remind myself of that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! And remember, it’s not about getting it perfect; it’s about making progress. What else do you think could help you feel more prepared for this?

User: Maybe I could write down some encouraging thoughts to remind myself of. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing down affirmations can be a powerful tool. What kind of affirmations do you think would resonate with you?

User: Something like "I am enough" or "Mistakes are okay."

Consultant: Those are wonderful affirmations! They reinforce that you deserve to feel confident and that imperfections are part of being human. Would you like to add anything else to that list?

User: I think just keeping in mind that others have their insecurities too might help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic addition! Recognizing that everyone faces their challenges can ease the pressure you place on yourself. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: Not really, I think we’ve covered a lot, but I’m just feeling anxious about the next steps.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to feel anxious. You’re taking positive steps forward. I believe in your ability to navigate this.

User: Thanks for saying that. It means a lot.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Liu! You’re doing the hard work. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about what we’ve discussed today? 

User: I feel hopeful but still a bit anxious, to be honest.

Consultant: And that’s perfectly okay! Hope and anxiety can coexist. The key is to take action despite the anxiety, and you are already on that path. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Me too. Thank you for all your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Until next time, take care and remember to be kind to yourself.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite frustrated and embarrassed, especially thinking about my attempts to speak up in class. I just can't shake the anxiety that comes with it.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like that experience was really tough for you. Can you share more about what happened when you tried to speak in class?

User: Well, I felt my heart racing and my voice trembling. I ended up just stumbling over my words, which made me feel even more embarrassed. It seems like I just can't do it.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s understandable to feel embarrassed after such a situation. What thoughts started swirling in your mind during that moment?

User: I thought everyone must think I'm ridiculous or that I don’t belong there. I felt so small and awkward.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to have a strong impact on how you feel. Can we explore how these thoughts make you feel when you think about your classmates' opinions of you?

User: I guess I just feel worthless. It reinforces this belief that I’m not good enough, especially in social situations.

Consultant: I hear you, Liu. It sounds like these thoughts are really pervasive for you. Let’s take a moment to examine this—what evidence do you have that supports this belief of being "not good enough"?

User: I don't have any concrete proof, but that’s just how I feel. It’s as if I always fall short compared to others.

Consultant: It’s really common to have these emotions tied to our experiences. However, sometimes our feelings can distort reality. If a friend were to tell you they felt this way, how would you respond to them?

User: I guess I’d tell them that everyone has their moments and that it’s okay to stumble sometimes. They shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective! Can you see how you could apply this same understanding to yourself? 

User: I can try. It’s just hard to switch off that self-criticism in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. How about we create an action plan for your next class? What small, manageable approach could you take to help ease into speaking up?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking in front of a mirror before class? Just to get used to hearing my own voice.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Practicing in front of a mirror might help build your confidence. Let’s also consider a technique for when you start to feel anxious during class. What could you do in those moments to ground yourself?

User: I could try taking deep breaths to calm my mind before I speak. It might help me focus.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy. It can really help center your thoughts. How about we also write down some positive affirmations that you can use to counteract the negative thoughts when they arise?

User: That sounds helpful. I’ll need reminders to think positively, especially in stressful situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can craft some affirmations together. For instance, saying things like, “I am capable of speaking up” or “It’s okay to make mistakes.” How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! It feels good to have something positive to hold onto instead of all that negativity.

Consultant: Great! Keep reminding yourself of these affirmations, especially before class. How about we wrap up for today by discussing how you’ll track your feelings and thoughts after your next interactions at school?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I note down what I felt and thought each time I engaged in class. That way, I can see any patterns.

Consultant: Yes, that's a wonderful approach! Journaling will help you analyze your feelings and identify those triggers. This awareness is the first step to challenging those negative thoughts.

User: I feel more hopeful thinking about it this way. It does feel comforting to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu! It’s important to recognize the progress you’ve made. Remember, every small step counts. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to putting these ideas into practice.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges. Just remember to be kind to yourself along the way. See you in the next session!

User: Talk to you later!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a mix of emotions. I still feel nervous in social situations, especially when it comes to interacting with people I don’t know well. I didn’t participate in the activities at a recent gathering, and that left me feeling a bit down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been reflecting on the situation. Feeling down after avoiding an activity is completely understandable. Can you share more about what specific thoughts ran through your mind when you chose to leave the gathering?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I joined in. I imagined everyone watching me and judging me.

Consultant: That seems quite challenging to deal with. Those thoughts can certainly heighten anxiety. When you think about the judgment from others, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and a bit ashamed. I wish I could just join in without feeling that way.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Liu. Wanting to join in and feeling anxious at the same time is a tough place to be. Let’s explore these thoughts together. Do you think there's a possibility that the way you view the situation might be a bit extreme or negative?

User: Yes, I guess I might be overthinking it. I tend to jump to the worst-case scenario in my head.

Consultant: That's a common pattern, and you’re not alone in that. What if we tried to identify some evidence for and against those thoughts? For instance, in past social situations, what has actually happened when you participated?

User: Well, sometimes it goes better than I expected. I have had moments where I made a connection or shared a laugh, but I tend to forget those times when I'm anxious.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Liu! Focusing on those positive moments can help counterbalance the anxious thoughts. Could we try to create a small goal for your next social event, something that allows you to gradually approach participation?

User: Maybe I could aim to stay for at least one game or activity, even if I don't feel comfortable at first.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Setting a small target makes it more manageable. How do you think you might prepare yourself to handle the anxiety when you encounter that situation?

User: I think I could practice deep breathing beforehand. I've learned about that technique, and it does help a bit.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful tool to manage anxiety! Let's incorporate that into your plan. How about we outline a brief routine for you to follow before and during the gathering?

User: Sure! I can take a few deep breaths before I arrive and maybe again if I start to feel overwhelmed during the event.

Consultant: Excellent approach, Liu! Practicing those deep breaths can provide you with a sense of control. Is there anything else you think might help ease your anxiety in these moments?

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that I’m not alone in this experience. Others might feel the same way.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate way to view it! Reminding yourself that it's perfectly fine to feel nervous can help normalize your experience. Let’s summarize what we've discussed today regarding your upcoming goal and the techniques you’ll use.

User: Okay, I plan to try to stay for one activity, practice deep breathing before and during, and remind myself that it's okay to be nervous.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Reflecting on your progress is also crucial. After the event, how will you check in with yourself to see how everything went?

User: I could write down what I experienced after the gathering, focusing on any positive interactions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Liu! Journaling your experiences can reinforce the positives and help you learn from each situation. Before we wrap up today, how are you feeling about these strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now! I actually like the idea of setting a goal for myself and using breathing techniques.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Building your social confidence is a journey, and you're taking important steps. Remember, progress often comes in small increments. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I'm looking forward to hearing how things go for you at the next gathering. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need extra support. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. I've been looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a little better. I had a chat with a girl recently, and I wasn't as nervous as I usually am. It felt great, but I still have this lingering worry about what she might think of me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful step forward! It sounds like you’re building some confidence in your social interactions. However, it’s understandable to still feel some anxiety regarding others' perceptions. Can you tell me more about those worries you have?

User: Well, I keep thinking that maybe I said something wrong or that she didn't like me. It just makes me anxious to think I might have messed things up.

Consultant: It seems like you're very aware of how you might be perceived by her. This can create a lot of pressure during social exchanges. Let’s explore that thought: what evidence do you have that she didn’t like you or that you said something wrong?

User: I mean, she smiled and seemed to engage with me, but then I thought about it too much afterward and felt unsure.

Consultant: That’s interesting. So, the interaction seemed positive at the moment, but afterwards, those doubts crept in. Have you ever experienced a situation where your initial thoughts turned out to be different from reality?

User: Yeah, a few times! Like, I thought I bombed a presentation, but my classmates told me I did well afterwards.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common for our minds to play tricks on us after the fact. What do you think led you to doubt the positive feedback you received during your conversation with her?

User: I guess I’m just used to being anxious about how I’m perceived. It’s hard to shake off those old habits.

Consultant: It makes sense. Changing deeply ingrained thoughts takes time. How about we start reframing your thoughts about social situations? If you could give a friend advice in a similar situation, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them to not worry too much and focus on enjoying the conversation.

Consultant: That’s great advice! Why not try applying that to your situation, too? What if you approached future conversations with the mindset of enjoying the moment rather than focusing on potential judgments?

User: I think that could help! It would make things feel less pressured.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s work on practicing that mindset. In our next sessions, we can develop strategies to help you enjoy social interactions more. What specific situations do you think you can try this mindset with?

User: Maybe during group discussions in class. I often feel judged when I speak up there.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect place to practice this new perspective. You could focus on the excitement of sharing your ideas rather than how others might respond. How does that sound to you?

User: Good! I can see how that might change my approach. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s also think about some positive affirmations you could tell yourself before you engage in discussions, reinforcing confidence rather than worry. What might be a good affirmation for you? 

User: Maybe something like, "I have valuable thoughts, and it’s okay to share them."

Consultant: I love that! Having an affirmation like that can help redirect your thoughts when anxiety surfaces. When do you think you’ll remind yourself of this affirmation before speaking up?

User: Probably before every class where we have to discuss topics!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Each time you do this, you're reinforcing a positive mindset. Remember, it’s a gradual process, and celebrating those small wins will be essential. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel hopeful! It seems manageable, and I really want to keep improving.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to still feel some anxiety; the goal is to manage it better over time. We’ll keep reinforcing those skills and add more techniques, like coping strategies for when you feel overwhelmed. What do you think?

User: That sounds good. I’d like to learn more about coping strategies, especially in moments of high pressure.

Consultant: Excellent! Next time, we can delve deeper into situational coping strategies that can help during those moments. It’s all about practice and maintaining your progress. How do you feel about setting this goal for our next session?

User: I’m definitely on board! Having specific strategies will likely help a lot.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today’s session, can we summarize what you’ll focus on until we meet again? 

User: Sure! I will practice enjoying conversations, use my affirmation before class discussions, and work on developing coping strategies.

Consultant: Perfect! It sounds like a strong plan. I’m confident that you’ll continue to make progress. Remember, enjoy the process, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thanks! I feel more prepared and excited to try these out. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I’m glad to see you for today’s session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I’ve managed to keep up with my social interactions, especially during group discussions, but I still feel a bit anxious when I meet new people.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re maintaining your social interactions. It’s common to still feel anxious in new situations. Can you share more about those feelings when you meet someone new?

User: Sure. I often worry about what to say and how they perceive me. It's like my mind goes blank sometimes, and then I feel embarrassed.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments can be really challenging for you. When you're concerned about how others perceive you, do you notice any specific thoughts that come to mind?

User: Yes, I often think that they might find me boring or uninteresting. That thought just adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: I can see how that thought might make you feel more anxious. Let’s explore that a little more—what evidence do you have that they would find you boring? Have you received feedback that suggests this?

User: No, I haven’t really received that kind of feedback. It’s more of an assumption I make in my head.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Liu. It seems like your mind is jumping to conclusions without concrete evidence. How about we work on challenging that assumption? What might someone who knows you well say about your interests and personality?

User: They would probably say I have a lot of interesting hobbies and ideas to share. I just get in my head sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You have qualities that people appreciate, and it’s great that you recognize that. If a friend were experiencing the same anxiety about being boring, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and that everyone has something valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Now, let’s use that advice for yourself. Next time you meet someone new, can you remind yourself of that? Being yourself is often the best approach.

User: I can definitely try that. It feels a little more freeing to think about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also set some practical steps. What kind of social situations would you like to practice in, and how can we prepare for them together?

User: I think I’d like to practice casual conversations at social events or maybe even in my classes.

Consultant: Those are great settings to practice! We could create some conversation starters that you can use in those environments. What are some topics you feel comfortable discussing?

User: I’m usually okay talking about music or movies, and I love hearing other people’s opinions on them.

Consultant: Perfect! We can use those topics as your go-tos. Why don’t you try to initiate a conversation about a recent movie or song with someone in class this week?

User: That sounds doable. I can mention a song I really like and ask for their thoughts on it.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a fantastic way to connect. Also, how do you feel about developing a mantra or positive phrase to remember when you start feeling anxious in these situations?

User: I think having a phrase could help. Maybe something like “just be yourself” or “it’s okay to be me”?

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Repeating that to yourself can act as a reminder that you have many great attributes to share. How do you envision using this mantra in a social setting?

User: I would remind myself before I enter a conversation—maybe even say it quietly to myself if I start feeling nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to evaluate your progress. How do you feel about your social skills compared to when we first started this journey?

User: I feel much more confident now. Even though I still get anxious, I think I have tools to manage it better.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Liu! You’ve done well in recognizing your strengths and equipping yourself with strategies. As you move forward, what are some goals you’d like to set for your social interactions in the coming weeks?

User: I want to try having a meaningful conversation with at least three new people in my courses and continue to practice my conversation starters.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! I believe you’ll see great progress by putting yourself out there. Remember, there may be ups and downs, but you’re building valuable skills along the way.

User: Thank you! I feel motivated to keep improving.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Today has been really productive, and I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Whenever you feel uncertain, remind yourself of these strategies and the progress you’ve made. I look forward to seeing you next time!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your guidance. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, actually. I managed to manage my anxiety quite well during the recent social activities at school. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress in managing your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specific strategies or techniques worked for you?

User: I focused on reminding myself to take deep breaths and not to overthink everything. It helped me stay calm.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a powerful tool. It’s impressive that you could apply it in social situations. How did you feel during the activities when you were using these techniques?

User: I felt more relaxed than usual. I was able to engage in conversations without feeling too much pressure.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Engaging without pressure is a significant step forward. Were there any moments where you still felt a hint of anxiety or discomfort?

User: There were a few moments when I felt a bit anxious, especially when talking to someone I found interesting. I thought about how I might be judged.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially in new social interactions. What thoughts crossed your mind when you felt anxious in those moments?

User: I worried that I would say something stupid or that they wouldn’t like me.

Consultant: I see. Those automatic thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety. Let’s explore them together. How valid do you think those thoughts are? Is there evidence to support them?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, people seem friendly and engaged.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization! It’s common for our minds to distort reality. If a close friend were expressing those worries, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much and that people are usually understanding.

Consultant: Exactly! Applying that same advice to yourself can be very helpful. What if we try to reframe those thoughts? For example, instead of thinking "I’ll say something stupid," what alternative thought could you have?

User: Maybe I could think, "It's okay if I stumble; everyone does. They might even find it charming."

Consultant: That's a great alternative thought! It promotes kindness towards yourself. How do you feel when you say that to yourself instead?

User: I feel a little bit lighter and more positive.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remembering this positive reframe can be very powerful in managing anxiety. Looking ahead, what specific situations do you think might challenge you in the future?

User: I might have more social events coming up, and I’m a bit worried about those.

Consultant: It’s good to anticipate challenges. How might you prepare for those upcoming events using the techniques we've discussed?

User: I could practice my deep breathing and remind myself of positive self-talk before interacting with others.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Proactive preparation can help reduce anxiety. Is there anything else you think would be beneficial to focus on for your future interactions?

User: Maybe I could also engage more in playful conversation in a relaxed setting to build my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in light, playful dialogue can help ease tension. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think realizing that my anxious thoughts aren't always true is a big takeaway for me.

Consultant: That is indeed a crucial insight! As you continue to practice this, it will strengthen your ability to manage anxiety. How do you plan to reinforce this learning in your daily life?

User: I’ll try to catch myself when I start to think negatively and replace those thoughts with more positive ones.

Consultant: That’s a great commitment, Liu! Remember, it’s a process. As you move forward, you might also want to keep a journal to reflect on your experiences and progress.

User: I like that idea! I’ll definitely give journaling a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! If you ever feel the need for additional support, please remember that you can reach out. You've made significant progress in managing your anxiety. 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance! I feel more confident going into the future.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. I wish you all the best in applying these strategies. Remember, you’ve got the tools now to handle future challenges. 

User: I appreciate it. I’ll keep practicing. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! This concludes our session today. Take care, and don’t hesitate to return if you need support in the future. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
