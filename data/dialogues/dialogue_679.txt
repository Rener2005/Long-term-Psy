Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. My recent mock exam didn't go well at all, and I'm worried about my future results. It feels like everything is just piling up on me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the mock exam has added a lot of pressure for you. Can you share what specific feelings or thoughts come up when you think about that exam?

User: I just feel so disappointed in myself. I expected to do much better, and now I'm doubting whether I can even get into a good college. It's like I'm failing already.

Consultant: That's really tough. Feeling disappointed and doubting your abilities can be incredibly overwhelming. What do you think has contributed to these feelings, especially in relation to your expectations?

User: I guess I've always had high expectations from my mom, and I feel like I need to prove myself. When I didn't score well, it made me feel like I'm letting her down too.

Consultant: It sounds like a lot of pressure is coming from your own expectations and also from wanting to meet your mother's hopes. Can you tell me what feelings arise when you think about her expectations?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and fear. I don't want to disappoint her, but sometimes it feels impossible to meet those standards. It's like I'm in a trap.

Consultant: That feeling of being trapped can be very painful. It might help us to explore the specific thoughts you have when you think about disappointing her. What thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, she'll be really upset with me. And then I think, maybe I'm just not smart enough for this.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy. It seems you're linking your worth to your performance. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts, or could there be another perspective we could consider?

User: I guess part of me knows that my grades don't define who I am. But in the moment, it just feels so real, and it's hard to see it any other way.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It’s great that you recognize that your grades don’t determine your worth. If a friend were in your situation feeling this way, how would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them that grades aren’t everything and that they should focus on their efforts instead of just the results. But it’s easier to say that to someone else than to believe it myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's often easier to be compassionate towards others than towards ourselves. How about we try to apply that same kindness to your situation? What would it mean for you to focus on your efforts instead?

User: It would probably take some of that pressure off. I could concentrate more on studying than worrying about the outcome.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier approach. Let’s think of ways to highlight your efforts instead of the results. Could we create some small goals for your study sessions to help shift your focus?

User: Yes, that could help. Maybe I could set a goal of studying for a certain amount of time each day, regardless of how much I cover.

Consultant: Great idea! Setting specific time-based goals can help. What could be a reasonable amount of time for you to start with?

User: I think starting with an hour each day would be good. It feels manageable.

Consultant: An hour sounds perfect! As you engage in this new approach, how do you think it will impact your anxiety about studying?

User: I think it might lessen the pressure a bit. If I focus on just studying for the hour, I can avoid spiraling into panic about my grades.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember to celebrate those efforts, no matter how small. How else can you support yourself during this time?

User: Maybe I could also practice some relaxation techniques. I’ve heard a bit about deep breathing exercises that can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be incredibly effective in managing anxiety. Would you like to try practicing a simple breathing exercise together?

User: Sure! That sounds helpful.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? Let’s try it together.

User: Okay, here we go. (Breathes deeply) 

Consultant: Well done! How do you feel after trying that breathing exercise?

User: I feel a little calmer. It was nice to take a moment to just breathe.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating that into your routine could really help balance that anxiety. What are some other ways you might practice self-care as you prepare for your exams?

User: I think I could make time for things I enjoy, like listening to music or hanging out with friends, just to get my mind off things.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Enjoying leisure activities can really help recharge your mental energy. How do you feel about integrating those activities into your study schedule?

User: It sounds good. I can plan some downtime after study sessions to reward myself.

Consultant: That’s a great plan. Balancing work and relaxation is key. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've learned about managing your anxiety?

User: I’ve realized that my worth isn’t tied to my grades and that focusing on my efforts can help lessen my anxiety. It feels good to have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made such important insights today. Remember, it's a journey, and you’re taking the right steps. If you need support again, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. It makes me feel better to know I can reach out.

Consultant: Absolutely, anytime! Let’s keep building on this progress in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been feeling quite anxious with the mid-term exams approaching. Can we start by discussing how you're feeling about your studies right now?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. It's like there's this weight on my shoulders, and I worry I won't do well. My mom has really high expectations, and the pressure just makes it worse.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure from your mom's expectations, along with your own worries about the exams, is making you feel quite stressed. Could you tell me more about what specific thoughts are coming to your mind when you think about the exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't get top grades, I'm going to let everyone down. It feels like I can't handle the thought of failing.

Consultant: That’s a really heavy thought to carry—believing that anything less than top grades would be a failure. When those thoughts come up, how do they make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and helpless. It’s like I get this knot in my stomach, and I just want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way in response to such high expectations. This feeling of wanting to avoid studying can become a cycle. What do you think happens most often when you try to study?

User: I sit down, but then I just can't focus. My mind wanders, and I keep thinking about how I might fail. Then I get frustrated and just give up.

Consultant: That frustration must be really tough to deal with. It sounds like there’s a connection between your thoughts about failure and your ability to concentrate. Have you noticed any other thoughts that seem to pop up when you start feeling this way?

User: Sometimes I think that everyone else is going to do better than me. It feels like I’m in a constant comparison with my classmates.

Consultant: Comparing yourself to others can certainly add to that pressure and anxiety. Let’s think about those comparisons for a moment—what evidence do you have that you won't do as well as them?

User: Well, they seem to study more effectively than me. I see their grades, and it's disheartening.

Consultant: It sounds like you're using their grades as a benchmark for your success. But what if we considered the possibility that everyone has their own strengths and struggles? If you were to look at your studies objectively, what might you notice?

User: I guess I do try to study, even if I'm not as effective as them. But it still doesn’t feel good enough.

Consultant: It's good that you recognize your efforts. Remember, studying takes practice, and it’s okay to not be perfect. What if we challenged the idea that only top grades measure your worth? How might that change the way you approach your studies?

User: I suppose if I focused more on my own progress rather than grades, it might help me feel better. But it’s hard to let go of that pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely, shifting that mindset can be challenging. Let’s think about a small step you can take to shift your focus from comparison to personal growth. What might that step look like for you?

User: Maybe I could set some personal goals for my study sessions rather than just aiming for high grades. 

Consultant: Setting personal goals is an excellent idea! What specific goals could you set for yourself that feel manageable and less overwhelming?

User: Perhaps I could aim to cover a certain number of chapters each week instead of focusing solely on the grades.

Consultant: That definitely sounds more achievable! Focusing on what you can control, like your study schedule, puts the power in your hands. How do you feel about this new approach?

User: I think I feel a bit less anxious thinking about it this way. It feels more within my control.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing that you have control over your actions can help reduce that feeling of helplessness. As we start to wrap up today, what strategies do you think you can employ to keep this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I could remind myself that my worth isn't tied to grades and focus more on my effort. Maybe I can also talk to my mom about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: Having that conversation with your mom could really help her understand your perspective. It’s important to express how you’re feeling. Before we end, let's recap what you've learned today and how you'll apply it in your daily routine.

User: I learned that I can set personal goals and that it’s okay to not be perfect. I also want to fight that urge to compare myself with others.

Consultant: You’ve made some excellent progress today! Remember, it’s about your journey and how you grow. If you keep these strategies in mind, I believe you’ll handle the upcoming exams with more confidence. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate this conversation. It has helped me see things differently.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Take care, and I look forward to our next session. You've got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I remember from our last session that you've been feeling quite anxious, especially comparing yourself to your peers. How are you feeling now?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling pretty anxious about the upcoming mock exams. It feels like everyone's studying hard, and I'm just questioning my own abilities. I wish I could stop comparing myself to others.

Consultant: I understand that you're experiencing increased anxiety and self-doubt, particularly during this competitive time. It's common to have those feelings. What specific thoughts do you have when you find yourself comparing yourself to your peers?

User: I often think that I'm not studying enough or that I'll fail compared to others. It makes me feel really inadequate.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Can you tell me how those thoughts make you feel emotionally? When you think, “I'm not studying enough,” what kind of emotions arise?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even hopeless about my situation. It's like I can't see a way out; I'm just stuck in this negative cycle of thinking.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are not just impacting your anxiety but also your motivation to study. Let's explore this further. Do you notice any patterns or triggers that lead to these negative thoughts when comparing yourself to others?

User: I notice it mostly when I'm in class or when we talk about grades. Seeing my classmates work so hard makes me feel like I'm falling behind.

Consultant: That makes sense. Being in that environment can definitely heighten those feelings. When you think about your classmates working hard, what specific thoughts do you have about yourself in that moment?

User: I often think, “I should be working harder, too,” or “They are so much better than I am.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh. Have you ever considered how accurate these thoughts are? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: I guess there's no definitive proof. I mean, I've done well in the past, but I tend to ignore those successes and focus only on my perceived failures.

Consultant: It’s important to celebrate your past successes, as they reflect your ability and hard work. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts together. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them to recognize their strengths and that it's okay to have ups and downs. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It sounds like you see the value in recognizing personal strengths. How might you apply that same kind of kindness to yourself when you start feeling inadequate about your studies?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself of my strengths, like how I've managed to study effectively before and my interests outside of school.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Focusing on your interests and strengths can provide a good counterbalance to those negative comparisons. Can we explore together some specific interests or activities that make you feel good about yourself?

User: Oh, I really enjoy playing guitar. It helps me relax and I feel accomplished when I practice.

Consultant: Playing guitar sounds wonderful! How can you integrate more of that into your routine, especially during that stressful study period?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time to play after studying. It might help me unwind and clear my mind.

Consultant: Absolutely! That could be a great way to release tension and refocus your thoughts. Let’s also consider some techniques for when those negative thoughts creep in. For instance, when you catch yourself in comparison mode, what strategy could you use to shift your focus?

User: I could try to challenge the thoughts or redirect my attention to something I enjoy, like music.

Consultant: Yes! That sounds like an effective plan. And remember, it’s about taking small steps and being patient with yourself. How do you feel about implementing this approach in your daily routine?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems like a manageable way to deal with my anxiety and those comparisons.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s recap: you’ll try to remind yourself of your strengths, incorporate guitar playing into your routine, and work on challenging negative comparisons. Does that sound like a manageable plan for you?

User: Yes, it does! I’m feeling more positive just thinking about it.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It's important to build a habit of self-compassion and focus on what truly matters to you. Moving forward, we can keep track of your progress and adjust strategies as needed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I look forward to our next session and seeing how it goes.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your journey too! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. You’re developing skills to manage these challenges, and that’s commendable. Good luck with everything, and we will talk soon!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been doing okay, trying to balance my studies with some hobbies. I recently joined a club at school, and it's been a nice way to relieve stress.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you’re finding ways to manage your stress. Balancing studies with hobbies can indeed improve your well-being. Can you share more about how you’ve been combining your studying and your hobbies?

User: Well, I usually study for a few hours and then spend some time on my club activities, which helps me unwind. But I also worry that I'm not studying enough for my upcoming exams.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with exams approaching. It seems like you're trying to find a good rhythm between your studies and your interests. How do you feel about the time you’ve set aside for both studying and your club activities?

User: I feel a bit guilty sometimes when I take breaks for my hobbies. I keep thinking I should be studying instead, but when I do take the breaks, I actually feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Guilt can definitely make it hard to enjoy your hobbies, despite their positive effects. Let’s explore that a bit more. What thoughts come to your mind when you're taking breaks for your hobbies? 

User: I think things like, “I should be studying right now” or “I can’t afford to waste time.” 

Consultant: Those are common thoughts, and they can be quite powerful. Have you noticed how these thoughts impact your feelings when you're engaging in your hobbies?

User: Yes, they make me feel stressed even when I’m trying to enjoy myself. It’s like I can't fully relax because I'm worried about falling behind.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like there’s a conflict between enjoying your hobby and the pressure of your studies. What would happen if you allowed yourself to fully enjoy your hobbies without those guilty thoughts?

User: I think I would feel really relieved and maybe even more motivated to study afterward. It’s hard for me to imagine fully letting go, though.

Consultant: It’s understandable to find that difficult. What if we tried to challenge those guilty thoughts together? For example, is there evidence to support the idea that taking breaks is actually harmful to your studying?

User: Well, I’ve noticed that when I take breaks, I usually come back to my studies feeling more refreshed and able to focus better.

Consultant: That's a great observation! It seems like those moments of rest actually enhance your study sessions. How about we formulate a plan that includes both study time and hobby time, where you can enjoy your hobbies guilt-free?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could work out a schedule for both, maybe even set specific times for breaks.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a schedule can help you feel more in control. What would a balanced schedule look like for you? How much time would you like to dedicate to each activity?

User: Maybe I could study for 90 minutes and then take a 30-minute break for my hobby. That way, I can keep focusing without the guilt.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable! Setting specific intervals makes it easier to transition from studying to enjoying your hobby. How do you feel about sticking to that schedule?

User: I feel hopeful about it. If I could manage this, I think I’d be able to focus better on my studies.

Consultant: That's a positive perspective! It's also essential to reinforce this habit. How about we think of ways to celebrate your accomplishments in both studying and engaging in your hobbies?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with more time for a hobby after a productive study session? That would motivate me to stick to my schedule.

Consultant: Great idea! Using rewards can reinforce your motivation. This way, you create positive associations with both studying and enjoying your hobbies. How do you plan to track your progress with this new schedule?

User: I could make a simple checklist or use an app to mark off when I complete my study sessions and take my breaks. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Visual reminders can strengthen your commitment and help maintain a balance. What do you think will be the biggest challenge in sticking to this plan?

User: I think the biggest challenge would be when I start feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork again. I might start skipping breaks.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. How can you remind yourself to stick to your plan, especially during those stressful moments?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or even tell a friend about my plan so they can help keep me accountable.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Having reminders and accountability can make a big difference. How are you feeling about your ability to implement this plan moving forward?

User: I feel more confident now. I think I can do it, especially since I've acknowledged how much my hobbies help me.

Consultant: That confidence is so important! Remember, it’s not just about studying; it’s also about enjoying your life and maintaining your mental health. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to take breaks because they actually help me. I need to allow myself to let go of the guilt.

Consultant: Absolutely! Giving yourself permission to enjoy those moments is a huge step. You've made excellent progress today, and I'm confident you'll find balance between your studies and hobbies. If you find yourself struggling, remember we can always make adjustments together. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. I remember that you've recently found an effective study method that has improved your confidence. How have you been feeling about your studies since we last talked?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty good! The new study method seems to be working well for me. I feel more in control and confident as I prepare for my exams.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing a positive shift in your mindset. Can you share a bit more about what this study method involves and why you think it's effective for you?

User: Sure! I’ve started breaking my study material into smaller chunks and setting short, achievable goals. It feels less overwhelming that way, and I can see my progress more clearly.

Consultant: Breaking down your material sounds like a great technique! How does achieving those smaller goals impact your overall confidence and motivation to study?

User: It really boosts my confidence! Every time I finish a chunk, I feel a sense of accomplishment. It helps me keep going without feeling too stressed.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It sounds like those small wins are very motivating for you. Have you noticed any specific feelings or thoughts that come up when you manage to complete a study goal?

User: Yes! I feel proud and relieved. I used to think the exams would be a disaster, but now I’m starting to believe I can actually do well.

Consultant: That’s a significant change in how you perceive your exams. It’s impressive that you’re shifting from fear to pride. In what ways do you think you can maintain or build on this shift as your exams approach?

User: I think I need to keep using this chunking method and maybe reward myself after finishing my study sessions. It could help reinforce my progress.

Consultant: Great idea! Implementing a rewards system can be a powerful way to maintain motivation. What kind of rewards do you think would work well for you?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a favorite snack or some downtime to watch a show after I finish studying. That could make it feel more rewarding.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely plan! How do you feel about integrating that reward system into your study routine starting this week?

User: I feel excited about it! I think having something to look forward to will help me push through the tougher study sessions.

Consultant: Excitement is a promising sign! As you prepare for your studies, how are you managing any pressure or stress that might arise along the way?

User: I try to take breaks when I feel overwhelmed and remind myself that it’s okay to not know everything right away.

Consultant: Acknowledging that it's okay not to know everything is very important! Have you been able to practice that self-compassion consistently, or do you find it challenging at times?

User: Sometimes it’s tough. I still have that voice in my head reminding me of what my mom expects from me. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given your background and your mother’s high expectations. How do you think you can approach those expectations in a way that keeps your confidence intact?

User: I guess I could focus on doing my best rather than aiming for perfection. Maybe I can remind myself of all the progress I’ve made.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Focusing on progress instead of perfection can alleviate some pressure. Can we explore how you might remind yourself of that progress during your study sessions?

User: I could keep a journal to note my daily achievements and how I feel after studying. Looking back at that could boost my morale.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent way to reflect on your achievements! How do you feel about using that as a tool to reinforce your positive experiences?

User: I feel really good about that. I think tracking my progress will help me stay positive and focused.

Consultant: It seems you're building a solid framework to support yourself during this exam period. As we prepare to conclude our session today, what is one key takeaway you’d like to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember to focus on my progress and celebrate my small wins. That’ll help me keep my confidence up.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway! Remember, maintaining that sense of accomplishment will be vital as you approach your exams. How do you envision implementing all the strategies we discussed moving forward?

User: I plan to apply the chunking method, set up a reward system, and keep a journal to track my progress. It feels like a solid plan.

Consultant: It certainly does! I believe you have the tools to maintain your positive changes and navigate the upcoming challenges. Remember, I’m here for you, and feel free to reach out anytime you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I feel much more equipped to handle my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m thrilled to hear that. Best of luck with your studies, and I look forward to seeing you again for our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello A! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you’ve been feeling quite satisfied with your recent exam results. How has that experience been for you?

User: Hi! Yes, I passed that important exam, and my score was a bit higher than I expected. It feels relieving, and I actually feel a little happier now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful news! It’s great to hear that you’re feeling happy and relieved. Let’s take a moment to reflect on this achievement. What do you think contributed to your success in this exam?

User: I think I studied really hard, and maybe my efforts paid off. I felt prepared, which helped a lot. But now, I’m curious about how to keep this momentum going for my future studies.

Consultant: It sounds like your hard work is really paying off, which is fantastic! Maintaining that momentum is important. What are your thoughts or feelings about your future study goals?

User: Well, I want to keep doing well, but I also feel a bit of pressure to maintain these results. Sometimes, it makes me anxious thinking about next steps, like college and what I should study.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel pressure regarding future expectations. Let’s explore that together. What specific aspects of college or your future studies are causing you the most anxiety right now?

User: I worry about making the right choice for my major. My mom has strong opinions on that, and sometimes I feel like I don't have much say in the decision.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of weight on your shoulders when it comes to choosing a major, especially with your mother's expectations. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel when you consider your options?

User: It makes me feel overwhelmed. I want to make her proud, but I also want to pursue something I’m genuinely interested in. The pressure makes it hard to think clearly.

Consultant: I can understand how that would leave you feeling conflicted and overwhelmed. Balancing your interests with parental expectations is challenging. Have you had a chance to express your own preferences about your major to your mom?

User: Not really. I’ve been too afraid to talk about it. I worry it will cause tension between us if I suggest something different from what she wants.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear potential conflict. Let’s think about this together. How might it feel to express your thoughts to your mom, even if it might be difficult?

User: I suppose it could be freeing, but I also fear her reaction. What if she doesn't support my choices?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Would it help to explore some ways to approach the conversation? Perhaps we can brainstorm how to express your thoughts while acknowledging her feelings.

User: That could help. I need a way to make her see my perspective without it turning into an argument.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sometimes, using “I” statements can help, like “I feel” or “I want,” to express your own beliefs while still being respectful. How do you feel about trying that?

User: That sounds good. I think it might help communicate my feelings better. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s think about some specific points you’d like to share with her. What are a few things you truly want to pursue for your studies?

User: I really enjoy literature and psychology. I think I want to explore those areas more.

Consultant: Those are both wonderful fields! Have you considered how you might frame those interests when you talk to your mom?

User: Maybe I can explain why I find them interesting and how they align with my career goals. I’ll need to think carefully about what to say.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Taking the time to clarify your thoughts will definitely help. Would it make you feel more prepared to discuss this if we role-played the conversation?

User: I think role-playing could help me feel more confident. 

Consultant: Let’s do that then! I’ll be your mom, and you can start with how you’d like to approach the conversation.

User: Okay... *takes a deep breath* “Mom, I wanted to talk to you about my future studies. I’ve been thinking a lot about my interests, and I really feel drawn to literature and psychology...”

Consultant: *as Mom* “That’s interesting, A. I have always thought you’d be great in a field that has a stable career. What makes you want to go into those areas?”

User: *continuing* “I believe studying literature can help me understand human experiences better, and psychology fascinates me because it explores how people think and behave. I think these subjects could lead to fulfilling careers.”

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful response! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good to express that. I hope it would resonate with her.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you’re on the right track. As we continue, let’s also think about how you’ll manage any discomfort you might feel during this conversation. Do you have any strategies in mind?

User: I could take deep breaths before speaking and remind myself that my feelings are valid.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing self-compassion will help ease any anxiety. As we begin to wrap up our session, what have you learned today that you can take with you moving forward?

User: I learned how to better express my interests and the importance of having that conversation with my mom. 

Consultant: That’s a significant takeaway, A. Remember, communicating openly can help strengthen your relationship with her. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any more support you feel you need right now?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I just need to put these plans into action.

Consultant: Sounds like a plan! I’m here to support you anytime you need. Remember to give yourself credit for the progress you’ve made today. Looking forward to our next session—good luck with your conversation!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it.
