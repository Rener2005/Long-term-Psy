Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially with the new semester starting. Meeting new classmates is just so nerve-wracking for me. I end up not participating in discussions, and afterward, I feel really guilty.

Consultant: I understand that meeting new people and engaging in discussions can bring a lot of anxiety. It sounds like you are feeling quite overwhelmed. Can you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll embarrass myself if I speak up. I worry that they'll judge me for my opinions or that I’ll just freeze up and not know what to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts must make it feel really daunting to participate. It’s normal to have worries about being judged, but let’s examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that others would judge you negatively?

User: I don’t have solid proof, but it just feels that way whenever I’m in a group. I think back to times when I’ve struggled to speak up, and it reinforces those feelings of inadequacy.

Consultant: It sounds like those past experiences are impacting your current perceptions and feelings. Let's explore this further. If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them regarding those thoughts?

User: I guess I would tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own insecurities. I would encourage them to try anyway, but I find it hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That's a really compassionate perspective you have for a friend! It shows that you believe in the possibility of overcoming challenges. What if we took that same approach and thought about how you might reframe your negative self-talk during social situations?

User: It’s just hard to shake off those thoughts. I often feel like I’m the only one struggling.

Consultant: You're certainly not alone in feeling that way; many people experience similar challenges. How about we practice some techniques that can help you manage these thoughts when they arise? What do you think about practicing positive self-talk instead of focusing on the negatives?

User: That sounds promising, but I’m not sure how to start. 

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! We can start simple. When you notice those anxious thoughts popping up, try replacing them with something more supportive. For example, “It's okay if I stumble; I’m learning” or “Everyone has their own struggles.” Would you be willing to try that?

User: I could try that, but I might forget in the moment.

Consultant: That's a common concern. We can work on creating some reminders for you, like writing these affirmations down or even setting a phone reminder before you have class or meetings. Would that help you?

User: Yes, I think having reminders would help. 

Consultant: Great! It's all about implementing small changes that can gradually make a big difference. Now, can we also discuss any positive experiences you've had during social interactions, no matter how small?

User: Well, I had a brief conversation with a classmate the other day. It felt okay, at least for a moment.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! Acknowledging those moments is important. How did you feel during that interaction?

User: I felt nervous at first, but then it was nice to connect, even briefly. I guess I've had small wins too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those moments count, and they show your ability to engage. Let's build on that feeling of connection. Can we brainstorm some small steps you might take to gradually increase your involvement in group settings?

User: Maybe I could try to speak up at least once in each class. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! Setting manageable expectations allows you to practice and build confidence. How would you feel about sharing your thoughts in a smaller group first versus a larger one?

User: I think a smaller group would be less intimidating. I might feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Focusing on smaller environments can help you ease into speaking up more. How can we prepare you for those smaller discussions?

User: I could write down some thoughts or questions in advance. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparation can significantly reduce anxiety. Let's set a specific goal: how about selecting a topic or question to prepare for your next small group interaction? 

User: That sounds doable. I’ll work on that.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it's all about the process. Each step you take is a victory. As we get closer to wrapping up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel slightly more hopeful. I can see that I need to change my mindset and practice more.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Understanding that change takes time is crucial, and I believe in your ability to implement these strategies. Before we finish, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any concerns you still have?

User: Just the fear of not following through on these plans. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember, progress is not linear. It’s okay to have setbacks. We can check in on your progress next time and adjust as needed. Continually being kind to yourself will help along the way. 

User: Thanks. I appreciate that. 

Consultant: You're welcome! You've shown a lot of courage today discussing your feelings and concerns, and I'm proud of the steps you're willing to take. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session! 

User: Me too, thank you!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaopeng! I'm glad you've come in for this session. Last time we talked about your experiences with social anxiety, especially when answering questions in class. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've felt quite anxious since our last talk. I tried to answer a question in class again, but I ended up forgetting what I wanted to say because of my nerves. It made me feel really down afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a tough experience for you. It's understandable to feel disheartened after facing anxiety in a situation like that. Can you share more about what you felt in that moment when you were trying to speak up?

User: I felt my heart racing, and my mind went blank. I was sure everyone was judging me, which made it even harder to speak. I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That’s really challenging, Xiaopeng. It seems like your mind went into overdrive with worries about judgment. When you experience these feelings, what kind of thoughts cross your mind about yourself?

User: I often think I'm not good enough and that I’ll never be able to communicate effectively. I feel like I’m letting myself down and my classmate s whenever I hesitate to speak up.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those feelings, but I also wonder, how true do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence that supports those beliefs about yourself?

User: I guess they're not completely true. I mean, there have been times when I've communicated well. But those negative thoughts just seem to overpower the positive ones.

Consultant: That's a key insight! While it's normal to have negative thoughts, it's essential to challenge them. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their ability to speak up?

User: I would probably encourage them and remind them about their past successes. I’d say they shouldn't let one bad experience define them.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have a supportive mindset for others. Now let’s work on applying that same kindness to yourself. What if we could create a list of positive experiences you've had in social situations? That might help balance those heavy thoughts.

User: That could work! I can remember some instances where I had good conversations with classmates or friends. It just feels overshadowed by the bad moments.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's focus on those positive experiences. When you think about those instances, how do they make you feel about your social skills overall?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Maybe I do have some ability to engage with others. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful shift in perspective! Building on that hope, let’s talk about some small steps you can take to practice speaking up in class. Would you be comfortable trying to speak up again, perhaps starting with simpler questions or discussions?

User: I think I’d like that—starting small sounds manageable. 

Consultant: Great! We can set some goals for you to gradually increase your participation in class. How about aiming to answer at least one question per class, even if it's a simple one? 

User: I can try that! It sounds much less daunting. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Remember to take it one step at a time. Also, we can incorporate positive self-talk before and after these experiences. Can you think of a positive affirmation you could tell yourself during these moments?

User: Maybe I could say, "I am capable, and my thoughts matter." I think that could help.

Consultant: I love that affirmation! Repeating it can remind you of your potential. As you try out these strategies, observe how it affects your feelings around participating. What do you think you might notice?

User: I’d like to see if it helps reduce my anxiety and makes me feel more confident when speaking. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent focus for you. As we prepare to close our session, I want you to reflect on your progress and how these changes can lead to further growth. What are you hoping to achieve by our next session?

User: I hope to feel a bit more comfortable in class and maybe share a couple of thoughts without feeling too anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Xiaopeng! I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time. Remember, it’s perfectly fine to take small steps. You’re already doing a wonderful job in recognizing your feelings. Keep practicing those affirmations, and build on those positive experiences.

User: Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind and give it my best shot.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your ability to grow and improve. This is your journey, and you’re taking significant steps forward. I’m looking forward to our next conversation and hearing how it goes!

User: Me too! Thank you for your support today. I feel a bit more encouraged.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep nurturing that optimism. Until our next session, take care and remember you can always reach out if you need guidance.

User: I will! Bye for now!

Consultant: Bye, Xiaopeng! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaopeng! I'm really glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been experiencing some positive changes in your social interactions. How do you feel about your recent experiences?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling quite optimistic lately. I had a great conversation with a classmate the other day, and it made me wonder if I could really change my social habits.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems that this positive interaction has sparked some hope for you. Can you share more about what specifically made that conversation feel so enjoyable for you?

User: Well, we talked about our favorite movies, and I felt really comfortable sharing my opinions. It was nice not to feel as anxious as I usually do in social settings.

Consultant: It sounds like that conversation allowed you to express yourself without the usual anxiety. That's a great step forward! What do you think contributed to that comfort you experienced?

User: I think it was just a relaxed environment. We were both laughing and enjoying the topic, which helped me let my guard down a bit.

Consultant: A relaxed environment can definitely make a difference! It seems like you've tapped into a way to engage socially that feels enjoyable. How do you envision using this experience to tackle more complex social situations in the future?

User: I suppose I could try to find common interests with others, just like I did. But I'm still nervous about larger groups or unfamiliar people.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s okay to feel that way. One approach we can work on is gradually exposing yourself to new social scenarios. What would be a manageable step for you to practice in a slightly more challenging situation?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or attend a social event this week. It feels intimidating, though.

Consultant: Joining a study group is a great idea! It provides structure and a shared purpose, which could ease some of that tension. How about we talk about some strategies to help you feel more confident in that setting?

User: That would be helpful. Sometimes I just freeze when trying to start conversations.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. Let’s explore a few conversation starters that might make it easier for you to engage. What topics do you think might resonate with the people you’ll meet?

User: Maybe asking about school projects or their favorite subjects could work. I can relate to those.

Consultant: Those are excellent topics! Questions about shared experiences often lead to deeper conversations. Do you feel comfortable trying out these starters in your next social situation?

User: Yes, I think I can do that! It feels like a good way to build connections.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's also about being kind to yourself if things don’t go perfectly. If you feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to take a step back. How can you remind yourself of that during your next interaction?

User: I can tell myself it’s just practice, and it’s okay not to be perfect right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing it as practice can really help reduce pressure. You might even find it helpful to reflect on each interaction afterward. What do you think you'd learn about yourself through that reflection?

User: I guess I’d see my strengths and areas where I could improve. It would help me identify what worked well.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Focusing on your strengths can be empowering. As we progress, we can also incorporate techniques that promote those positive reflections. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good! I’m ready to embrace this journey and grow.

Consultant: I admire your enthusiasm, Xiaopeng! Building on these social skills takes time, but you’re already on the right path. Let’s check in on your experiences after you've had a chance to practice. Remember, your willingness to try is a significant achievement in itself.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more determined to embrace these challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. As we wrap up today, what is one main takeaway you’ll carry with you going forward?

User: I think it’s that I have the ability to connect with others, and that it's okay to take small steps.

Consultant: That’s an empowering realization! As you experiment with these new strategies, trust in your ability to grow. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Me too! Thank you so much for your guidance. 

Consultant: I’m always here for you, Xiaopeng. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaopeng! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been trying to apply the social strategies we discussed, especially during group activities. It’s still nerve-wracking at times, but I managed to communicate effectively last week.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Successfully communicating during a group activity is a significant step forward. Can you tell me more about what made that communication effective for you?

User: I think I was just more focused on the task and less on how I was coming across. I prepared what I wanted to say in advance, which helped ease my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like preparation played a crucial role in your success. How did it feel to see your efforts pay off in that situation?

User: It felt really rewarding. I was surprised by how well it went. I think I’m starting to believe that I can handle these situations better.

Consultant: That’s such an important realization! Building confidence takes time, and it seems you’re making great progress. What would you like to work on today to further support this growth?

User: I’d like to explore what to do when I feel anxious again, especially in unexpected social situations. I don't want to lose the momentum I've built.

Consultant: Absolutely, maintaining that momentum is key. Let’s discuss some potential strategies you can use when anxiety arises. Can you recall a recent moment when you felt anxious in a social setting?

User: Yes, during a class discussion last week, I felt my heart racing and struggled to speak up. I wanted to share my thoughts but felt overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in a lively discussion. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I spoke up or that my opinion didn’t matter.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly heighten anxiety. Let’s challenge them together. What evidence do you have that your opinion wouldn’t matter?

User: I guess there really isn’t much evidence. I mean, everyone’s voice is important in a discussion, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone contributes something unique. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably encourage them to share, reminding them that their perspective might really help someone else.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It seems like you’re beginning to internalize that your voice matters too. How might you apply this mindset the next time you’re in a similar situation?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that I have valuable thoughts to share, and it’s okay to speak up even if I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Xiaopeng! Practicing that mindset can help reduce anxiety over time. Are there any specific techniques you’d like to try to manage your anxiety when it arises?

User: I’ve heard about breathing exercises. Would they help in those moments?

Consultant: Yes, breathing exercises can be very effective in calming your nerves. Would you like to practice a simple one together now?

User: Sure! I’d love to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold for a count of four... and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I can see how it could help me refocus during classes.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Incorporating these techniques can really help manage your anxiety. How do you feel about using this strategy moving forward?

User: I feel positive about it. It gives me an actionable step I can take when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we draw closer to the end of our time today, let’s review some progress you’ve made. What do you believe has been your biggest achievement during our sessions?

User: I think developing my confidence in social interactions has been the biggest win. I’m starting to feel more capable of participating.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Xiaopeng! It reflects your hard work and resilience. Looking ahead, what resources will you lean on to maintain this growth?

User: I’ll keep practicing my breathing techniques and remind myself to prepare for discussions in advance. I also want to continue reflecting on my experiences.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies. Remember, every step you take reinforces your progress. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the journey you’re on?

User: I feel really optimistic! I believe I can continue improving and tackling more complex social situations.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I’m confident that you’ll carry this momentum forward. If you ever find yourself needing support, remember that you can always reach out. Until our next session, take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance. Looking forward to our next chat!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaopeng! I'm glad to see you here today. It sounds like you've been making some progress in your social interactions. How are you feeling about your recent experiences?

User: Hello! I've been feeling really good actually. Organizing that group seminar brought me a lot of joy, and the teacher's praise was a big boost for my confidence. I want to continue exploring my social potential.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the seminar was a significant achievement for you, and it’s great that you feel more confident now. What specific social situations would you like to tackle next?

User: I’d like to work on participating more actively in class discussions. I sometimes find it difficult to share my ideas even when I have them.

Consultant: Participating in class discussions can indeed feel challenging. What do you think is holding you back when you want to share your thoughts?

User: I often worry that my ideas might not be interesting or relevant, and then I hesitate to speak up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries! Let's explore that thought. Can you think of a time when you shared your ideas, and they were well-received? What did that feel like?

User: Yes, during the seminar I shared some ideas, and my classmates seemed to appreciate them. It felt really refreshing, but I also felt nervous beforehand.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows you can contribute meaningfully. Now, let’s challenge the thought that your ideas might not be interesting. What evidence do you have that support this belief? 

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence against it. It’s mostly just a fear of being judged.

Consultant: Fear of judgment is common, but awareness of it can help. What if you looked at it from a different perspective? Imagine a friend feeling the same way—what would you say to encourage them to share their ideas?

User: I would probably tell them that their perspective is valuable and that it's important to express themselves regardless of what others might think.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the inside knowledge that communication is valuable. What if you utilized that same encouragement for yourself next time you’re in class?

User: I suppose I could remind myself of that. It makes sense!

Consultant: That’s a great strategy. You might also consider small steps—such as trying to share at least one thought in every class. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! I think doing that will lessen my anxiety over time.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s also identify how to handle any anxiety that may come up when you do speak. What techniques do you currently use to calm yourself in nervous situations?

User: I usually take deep breaths, but sometimes that doesn't feel like enough.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good start. We might also explore visualization techniques or positive affirmations. For example, visualizing a successful interaction beforehand can help. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, that sounds interesting! I could imagine how responding to questions feels positive and engaging.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Visualization can help create a mental map of success. Additionally, after a class, reflecting on what went well and what you could improve can be beneficial. How do you feel about tracking your progress in that way?

User: I love that! Keeping track of my experiences will probably keep me motivated.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Tracking progress can be incredibly empowering. Let’s decide on a time frame—after a couple of weeks, we could review your experiences together. How does that sound?

User: That works for me! Having a follow-up will keep me accountable, and I can share everything with you.

Consultant: Exactly! Accountability is key. As we move forward, how can you remind yourself to embrace challenges even when it feels uncomfortable?

User: I’ll try to consciously tell myself that discomfort is part of growth and that every effort I make counts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to cultivate! Remember, every effort builds your confidence. As we prepare to wrap up today, what have been the most valuable insights or takeaways from our discussion so far?

User: I think realizing that my ideas are valuable and that fear doesn't have to stop me is really important. Plus, the strategies for tracking my progress feel empowering.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Embracing the value of your contributions and having strategies in place is a great step forward. As we conclude our session today, can you think of a specific situation coming up where you can apply these strategies?

User: Definitely! There's a class discussion next week, and I will prepare myself to share at least one idea.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember to visualize your success and be kind to yourself through the process. If you encounter challenges, we can fine-tune your approaches together next time. I’m excited to hear about your experience. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaopeng! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today. Keep up the excellent work. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Peng! I'm glad we could meet again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really good actually. That presentation I gave went really well, and I’ve been riding that positive energy since then!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It's great to see that you found satisfaction in your successful presentation. What specifics about that experience do you think contributed to how you feel now?

User: I realized that I can express myself well in front of people when I prepare and practice. The positive feedback from my classmates really boosted my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like preparation and practice made a significant difference for you. How do you plan to carry this confidence forward? 

User: I’m thinking of seeking more opportunities to speak in public and engage in group discussions. I want to build on this momentum.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. Seeking more opportunities can definitely help strengthen your social skills. What kind of situations have you considered for your next steps?

User: Maybe joining a debate club or participating more in class discussions. I feel like those environments would be beneficial.

Consultant: Joining a debate club sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in discussions can provide a supportive setting for practicing your skills. How do you feel about approaching these new opportunities?

User: I still feel a bit anxious about jumping into debates right away, but I think it would help me grow. 

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel some anxiety about taking on new challenges. Remember, it's a process. What strategies have helped you in situations where you felt anxious before?

User: I usually try to take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. It helps me calm down a little.

Consultant: Those are great techniques! Deep breathing and self-compassion are essential when facing anxiety. Do you think you could incorporate those strategies into your upcoming opportunities?

User: Yes, I think I can definitely use those strategies. I might also prepare some topics in advance so I feel more ready.

Consultant: Preparing topics is a brilliant approach! It gives you a sense of control. Would you like to brainstorm some potential topics together?

User: Sure! Maybe I could discuss current events or popular movies. Those are things I enjoy talking about.

Consultant: Those sound like engaging topics! Both allow for plenty of opinions and discussion. How do you envision yourself feeling when engaging in these conversations?

User: I hope I feel excited rather than anxious. Like it's a chance to share something I love.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Focusing on excitement rather than anxiety can significantly alter your experience. What support systems do you have in place that can help you during this journey?

User: I have friends who are supportive, and I can always talk to my family if I need encouragement. They've been really encouraging about my progress.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Having a support system is vital. How might you lean on them for encouragement as you pursue these new opportunities?

User: I could ask my friends to join me for some debates or discussions. Making it a group activity might help ease the pressure.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Engaging in these activities with friends can create a more relaxed atmosphere. How do you feel about discussing these plans with them?

User: I think they’d be on board! We often talk about our interests, and I’m sure they’d be excited to explore this with me.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Open communication with your friends will likely strengthen your bond while also enhancing your skills. As we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel really proud! Reflecting on everything, I can see how much I've grown, especially after that presentation and now planning more activities.

Consultant: You have done a remarkable job! It’s important to acknowledge your growth. What is one main takeaway you’d like to keep in mind moving forward?

User: I want to remind myself that I can handle social situations better than I think. I’ve proven that to myself recently.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Belief in your abilities can serve as a strong motivator. As we conclude our session today, how would you like to maintain this momentum in the weeks to come?

User: I’ll try to set specific goals for each week, like participating in one class discussion or organizing a small debate with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting specific weekly goals will help you stay focused and motivated. Just as a reminder, if you feel overwhelmed at any point, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the reminder. I feel much more empowered after our talk today.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made wonderful progress, and I believe you can continue to thrive. Whenever you're ready for another session or need support, just reach out. Goodbye for now, Xiao Peng!

User: Goodbye! Thank you for all your help!
