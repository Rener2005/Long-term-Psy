Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately. I understand you're facing some challenges at your new school. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lost and frustrated. I just can't seem to fit in or focus on my studies. My grades are dropping, and I feel like I don’t belong anywhere in this new environment. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through a really tough time adjusting, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let's dig a little deeper. Can you share what specific situations make you feel most uncomfortable or anxious?

User: I think it's mainly during group activities or when I'm trying to talk to classmates. I often feel like I'm being judged or that I just don't have anything valuable to say.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling when trying to connect with new people. When those negative thoughts come up, like feeling judged, what do you notice happening in your emotions or physical sensations?

User: I feel really anxious, my heart races, and I just want to escape the situation. Sometimes I just stay silent because I think it will be better that way.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are making you feel trapped and leading to avoidance, which can make things feel even harder. Let’s try to explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think that you don't have anything valuable to say, what evidence do you have for that belief?

User: Well, I see my classmates doing well and being confident. I just feel like I'm not at their level, so I assume whatever I say wouldn’t matter. 

Consultant: I hear you. You're comparing yourself to others, which can be really tough. If a friend were feeling this way about themselves, what would you tell them?

User: I suppose I would remind them that everyone is different and that their thoughts might not reflect reality. I might say it's okay to not be perfect all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a great understanding of self-compassion. Now, what if we applied that same kindness to yourself? Would that change how you feel about speaking up?

User: I guess it could help if I tried thinking that way. Maybe I can practice speaking up without judging myself so harshly.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! Let’s think of some small, manageable goals where you can practice speaking up. What do you think would be a good first step?

User: Maybe I could try to answer at least one question in class each day, even if it's just a short answer.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s specific and achievable. How do you feel about committing to that for the next week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can try it. Just having that small goal makes it feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Xiaoxi! Just remember to celebrate each step, no matter how small. How do you think achieving this goal will impact your confidence?

User: I imagine it might make me feel a bit more confident. If I can speak up, I might also feel a bit more included and connected with my classmates.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building those connections will help you feel more grounded. It'll take time, but each positive experience will add up. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: I just feel really alone in all of this. No one really seems to understand what I'm going through, and I miss my old friends.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to miss the support you had before. Feeling alone in a new environment can be really challenging. Have you considered reaching out to someone in your new school who might understand your situation?

User: I haven't really thought about it. I guess I was afraid they wouldn't care or understand.

Consultant: That fear is valid, but you might be surprised by how many people resonate with your feelings. Maybe there's a club or activity you can join—places where meeting new people is encouraged and supported?

User: I like that idea! There’s a gaming club that I might check out. I love video games, so I think I'd feel more comfortable there.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea, Xiaoxi! Finding a group that shares your interests can help ease some of that anxiety about connecting. How do you feel about pursuing that opportunity?

User: I feel excited! It’s nice to have something to look forward to, and I think it could help me make some new friends.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Can you commit to attending that gaming club meeting this week? 

User: Yes, I can definitely try!

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. It's great that you're taking these steps toward building connections and enhancing your confidence. Are there any other topics you'd like to touch upon before we wrap up?

User: I think I’ve shared a lot today. I just really want to keep working on this and improving. 

Consultant: I’m glad you shared today, Xiaoxi. It's clear that you're motivated to make positive changes. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. I believe you can navigate this. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I have a plan now, and that feels good.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you. Let’s check in next time to see how those steps are going. You’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you. 

User: I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to our next session! 

Consultant: I am too! Take care, Xiaoxi, and know that progress comes with time. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really lonely. I joined some club activities at school, but I just couldn’t connect with anyone. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that would be difficult for you. It's hard when you're trying to engage, but not getting the results you hoped for. Can you tell me more about what happened during those activities?

User: Well, I tried to talk to a few people, but I ended up just standing there feeling awkward. I felt like I didn’t know what to say, and then I just left feeling even worse.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's completely understandable to feel disheartened after that experience. What specific thoughts were going through your mind during those moments?

User: I kept thinking that I was just not good enough to make friends, or maybe no one really wanted to talk to me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry around. It seems like they might be affecting your confidence. Let’s explore that—how do those beliefs impact how you feel about yourself and your attempts to socialize?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious. I think if I can't do it perfectly, then it’s better not to try at all, but then I just end up feeling isolated.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaoxi. It sounds like there’s a part of you that feels you have to be perfect, and that’s creating a lot of pressure. What would it look like for you to approach social situations without that pressure?

User: I guess it would feel more relaxed? Like if I could just be myself and not worry so much about what other people think.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Let’s see if we can find a way to help you feel more at ease. What if we practiced some conversation starters together? This way, you might feel more prepared the next time you’re in a group.

User: That could help! I think having something to say would make me feel less nervous.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s come up with a few simple questions or comments that you could use when you meet new people. How about starting with something like, “What do you think of this event?” or “Have you done anything fun lately?”

User: Those sound easy enough! I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! And remember, even if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly, it’s still a step in the right direction. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. Maybe I won’t feel so lost next time.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Now, let's think about a situation where you can practice these skills. Is there a particular event coming up at school that you could attend?

User: Yes, there’s a game night this Friday. I might go to that.

Consultant: Perfect opportunity! You can try the conversation starters there. How do you feel about going to the game night with this plan in mind?

User: It sounds less intimidating now, actually. I’m feeling a bit excited.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about small steps and learning along the way. If you experience any negative feedback, what’s a healthy way to manage those feelings?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect and that everyone is there to have fun.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that it’s okay to not be perfect can really help you manage your responses. How can you remind yourself of that during the game night?

User: Maybe I can write it down and bring it with me. That might help if I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Keeping a little note can serve as a helpful reminder. As you prepare for the game night, what else can you do to support your own confidence?

User: I could practice a few more conversation starters and visualize myself having a good time with others.

Consultant: Visualization is a powerful tool! Imagining a positive interaction can help reduce anxiety as well. What emotions do you think you might feel if the night goes well?

User: I would feel happy and maybe a sense of belonging.

Consultant: Those are wonderful feelings to strive for! Let’s focus on that sense of belonging. In our next session, we can discuss how the game night went and any challenges you faced, so we can keep building on your experiences.

User: I’m looking forward to it. I definitely want to share how it goes.

Consultant: I’m excited for you as well! You've got a solid plan laid out. Remember, it's a journey, and each step you take is progress. How do you feel about today’s session?

User: I feel lighter and more prepared. Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoxi! I’m proud of you for taking these steps, and remember, I’m here to support you along the way. If anything arises before our next session, feel free to reach out. Good luck at the game night!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Xiaoxi! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! I'm really glad you're here today. I remember from our last session that you wanted to work on your reactions to negative feedback and managing your academic anxiety. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially after receiving some negative feedback from my teacher. It just makes me feel even worse about myself and my abilities.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaoxi. It sounds like the feedback really hit hard and has contributed to your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what thoughts went through your mind when you received that feedback?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I’m just not cut out for this. It felt like I could never do anything right, and I started to doubt whether I should even try anymore.

Consultant: That sounds very tough. Those thoughts of self-doubt can be really overwhelming. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: I felt really defeated and helpless. It’s like I want to do well, but the more I try, the more I feel like I'm failing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're facing such tough situations. You mentioned feeling helpless—do you recognize any patterns in how these thoughts come up, or is it more situational for you?

User: It mostly happens in class when I have to participate. The thought of being judged makes me anxious, and then it spirals from there.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiaoxi. So, it seems that being in a vulnerable position like participating in class triggers those negative thoughts. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in those moments?

User: I wish I could just ignore the feedback and focus on my own progress, but it feels impossible.

Consultant: It’s definitely challenging to ignore negative feedback, but what if we tried to reframe how you view it? Instead of seeing it as a direct reflection of your abilities, we could look at it as one person's perspective. What do you think?

User: That actually sounds kind of helpful. I guess it shouldn’t define me entirely.

Consultant: Exactly. If you were to view that feedback as feedback rather than a failure, how might that change your response? 

User: I suppose I could see it as something to learn from instead of just feeling bad about myself.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective, Xiaoxi. What steps could you take to remind yourself of that whenever you start feeling overwhelmed by feedback?

User: Maybe I could write it down and tell myself that one piece of feedback doesn’t reflect who I am.

Consultant: Writing it down sounds like a useful strategy. It can serve as a tangible reminder that feedback is just one piece of information. How do you think that would make you feel during class participation?

User: I think it would help me feel a little more grounded, less anxious about speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach. Let’s also think about some small ways you can gradually expose yourself to participating in class without feeling overwhelmed. What could be a small step for you?

User: Maybe I could start by asking a question instead of sharing my own thoughts. That feels less risky.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Starting with questions can open the door to participation while keeping the pressure lower. How do you feel about setting a goal to ask a question in each class this week?

User: I’m nervous, but I think I can try. It’s just a question after all.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s just a question, and remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. What’s important is that you’re taking active steps to face that fear. Do you have any strategies in mind for when you start feeling anxious while doing this?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s only one question. I can always improve.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique to calm those nerves. Remembering that improvement is a journey will also help keep you grounded. What do you need from me to support your progress on this?

User: Just your encouragement, I guess. I really want to make this work, and I appreciate our talks.

Consultant: I'm here to support you, Xiaoxi! It’s wonderful to see your determination. Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What do you feel are your biggest takeaways from this session?

User: I think I’m realizing that feedback isn’t the end of the world and that I can manage my reactions to it. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Recognizing that you have the tools to navigate feedback can build your confidence. As we conclude, do you feel ready to implement your plan for the week? 

User: I think so, yes! I feel a bit more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It's a pleasure to see you progress like this. Remember, take it one step at a time, and I believe you can do this. If you ever feel stuck, we can always talk again.  

User: Thank you so much for your help. I’ll see if I can manage my anxiety and tackle those questions in class!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoxi! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking today. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! I'm glad to see you again for our session. I know we discussed your recent success with the group project last time. How are you feeling about that experience now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit more confident because of the positive feedback we received. But I still wonder if I can maintain this confidence over time.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident! It’s normal to have those doubts about maintaining it. Can you share more about why you feel it might be hard to keep that confidence?

User: I think it’s because I haven’t had many successes in the past, and I worry that this was just a one-time thing. What if I can't replicate it?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Xiaoxi. It can be challenging to trust our abilities when we haven't consistently seen success. What would it feel like for you if you could believe that your success in the group project could lead to more successes in the future?

User: I guess it would feel empowering. But I still think I lack the skills to be successful on my own.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re acknowledging your achievements but also struggling with self-doubt about your skills. Can we explore what skills you felt you used in the group project that contributed to its success?

User: I think I communicated well with my teammates and helped organize our tasks. But I still don’t feel like I can do that alone without their support.

Consultant: Communication and organization are valuable skills, and you used them effectively! Let’s reflect on this: what would help you feel more capable of using those same skills independently in the future?

User: Maybe if I practice more or try to take on smaller tasks by myself first?

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Starting with smaller tasks can build your confidence gradually. What specific small task can you think of that you could take on next?

User: I was thinking of asking a classmate if I could present part of our next project alone. That feels a bit intimidating, though.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel intimidated, but this could be a great opportunity to challenge yourself! How might you prepare for that presentation to make it feel less overwhelming?

User: I could practice what I want to say in front of a mirror or with my mom first. That might help me feel less nervous.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is an excellent idea. It allows you to familiarize yourself with the material and boost your confidence. How do you think you would feel after successfully completing that presentation?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself, but I’m still worried about failing or not doing it well.

Consultant: That anxiety is completely normal, but remember, even if things don’t go perfectly, the experience is still valuable for your growth. How can we reframe what “doing it well” means to you?

User: Maybe “doing well” could mean just trying my best and learning from whatever happens, instead of aiming for perfection.

Consultant: I love that reframe! Focusing on effort and learning allows you to celebrate your accomplishments without the pressure of perfection. What might be your next steps after this presentation, regardless of the outcome?

User: If it goes well, I think I would want to take on more responsibilities in the next project. If it doesn’t, I’d want to figure out what went wrong and improve next time.

Consultant: Both approaches show a growth mindset, which is wonderful! This mindset will help you continually build your confidence. How do you feel about these next steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more motivated now! I want to try and see how much I can do on my own.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude, Xiaoxi! Building on your recent success and challenging yourself can lead to even greater achievements. As we wrap up today, what do you think you need to keep your motivation strong moving forward?

User: I think maybe setting small goals for myself and reminding myself of my successes could help keep me motivated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering past successes and setting manageable goals can really reinforce your confidence. I’m proud of how far you’ve come. Before our next session, keep me updated on how your presentation goes and any other challenges you choose to take on.

User: I will! Thank you so much for your help today. I’m feeling more optimistic about what’s ahead.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. See you next time, Xiaoxi!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling after the speech competition? 

User: Hi, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I was really nervous before the competition, but once I started, I felt a sense of determination. Even though I didn't win, the audience appreciated my efforts, and that meant a lot to me. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you experienced a moment of determination during the competition! It sounds like you were able to push through your nervousness and feel acknowledged for your efforts. How do you think this experience has impacted your confidence moving forward?

User: I think it has helped a bit. I feel like I can push myself more than I previously thought. But I'm still worried about facing challenges in the future.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel worried about future challenges. You’ve taken a significant step by participating in the competition. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about facing new challenges?

User: I often think that I might not be good enough, or that I'll embarrass myself if I try something new and fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to carry! It sounds like they stem from a fear of failure. Let's explore that a little. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won't succeed or that you'll embarrass yourself?

User: Well, I haven't really succeeded in many things on my own... and sometimes I feel like people expect more from me because of my background. 

Consultant: I understand. It’s understandable to feel pressure when people have high expectations. But let’s consider your recent experience with the speech competition. How did you succeed in participating, even if you didn’t get an award?

User: I managed to present my speech, and I did it alone, which felt really hard for me. The applause made me feel proud, even though I didn’t win.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Xiaoxi! You demonstrated courage by participating and engaging with the audience. This shows that you can face challenges. How might you remind yourself of this success when facing future challenges?

User: Maybe I could write it down or tell myself that if I can speak in front of people once, I can do it again.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Writing it down can help reinforce those positive experiences. What would you like to challenge yourself with next to further build your confidence?

User: I’d like to try out for a role in a school play. That seems really scary, but also exciting!

Consultant: Trying out for a role sounds like a fantastic challenge! It will not only help you build your confidence but also allow you to express yourself. What steps can you take to prepare for the audition?

User: I could start by practicing my lines and maybe asking a friend for tips on acting. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful steps! Practicing and seeking support from friends can make the process less daunting. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself as you prepare for the audition?

User: I think setting a goal would help. Maybe I could aim to practice for a specific amount of time each day leading up to the try-out.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Aiming for daily practice can make it feel more manageable. How about we set a specific target for your practice time? 

User: I’ll aim to practice for at least 30 minutes each day before the audition.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Xiaoxi! Now, let’s discuss how you can celebrate your efforts after reaching that goal. How would you like to reward yourself for practicing?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a movie or spend time with friends. 

Consultant: Treating yourself sounds like a lovely way to celebrate your hard work! Building in rewards can help maintain motivation. As you prepare for the audition, how can you remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes along the way?

User: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s part of learning. I just have to keep trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping this perspective can help alleviate some of the pressure and allow you to enjoy the process. How are you feeling about all this as we discuss it today?

User: I feel more excited and a bit less scared. It feels nice to have a plan and think about what I can accomplish. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s a positive shift in your feelings. Today, we’ve discussed how your recent experience has shaped your confidence, and you've created a plan to continue challenging yourself. How will you carry these insights into your future endeavors?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my success and my new goals. I think that will help me feel braver trying new things.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! You have the ability to build on your success and keep moving forward. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway you’d like to hold onto from this session? 

User: I think my key takeaway is that I can learn from each experience, and it’s okay to be nervous. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Xiaoxi! It’s okay to feel nervous while also recognizing your potential for growth through challenges. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you’re capable of achieving great things! 

User: Thank you! I’m really grateful for your help. I’m excited to see what I can do next!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited for you too. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxi! It's great to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your confidence and social activities?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling really good. I've joined new social activities and met some new friends. It feels nice, and I think my confidence has definitely improved.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's so encouraging to hear that you've made new friends and felt a boost in your confidence. Can you tell me what specific activities you've participated in and how they made you feel?

User: I joined a local soccer team and started playing on weekends. It's fun, and I get to bond with the other guys. I used to be really shy and hesitant to join things, but now I'm actually enjoying myself.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems like being part of the soccer team has really helped you connect with others and enjoy yourself. What changes have you noticed in yourself since getting involved in these activities?

User: I feel more comfortable around people and less anxious about making small talk. I even initiated conversations, which I never thought I could do!

Consultant: It's impressive to hear how you've taken that initiative. It sounds like you're breaking through some of those old patterns of hesitance. What do you think has contributed to this change in your approach to social interactions?

User: I guess my mentality has shifted. I realized that people are generally friendly and welcoming. Plus, being part of a team gives me a chance to connect without the pressure of chatting one-on-one right away.

Consultant: It's great to see how you’re recognizing the supportiveness of your environment. Now that you have these new friendships, do you have any thoughts on how you'd like to continue developing your social skills or interests further?

User: I want to keep participating in more activities and maybe even take on a leadership role in the team or something similar. This is all new to me, but I think I can do it.

Consultant: Taking on a leadership role sounds like an excellent way to challenge yourself and build on the confidence you've gained. Do you have any specific ideas in mind for how you might pursue that?

User: I’ve been thinking about organizing a small tournament or event for the team. I think it could help bring everyone together as well.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Organizing an event not only boosts your confidence but also can strengthen your relationships within the team. What steps do you think you might take to start planning this event?

User: I guess I could start by discussing the idea with the coach and my teammates to see if they’d be interested. Then I can work on the details from there.

Consultant: Collaborating with your teammates and coach is a great initial step. It not only shows your leadership but also allows you to gather input and support from others. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but also a little nervous. What if they don't like the idea or it doesn't go well?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel both excitement and nerves when stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember that not every idea will land perfectly, and that's okay. What’s important is that you're putting yourself out there and learning along the way. What could you remind yourself to help ease those nerves?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s just an idea, and it doesn’t have to be perfect. Everyone wants to have fun, and that’s what matters.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the enjoyment and the experience can really help alleviate some of the pressure. How do you feel about discussing strategies or reminders you can give yourself during the planning process?

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe something simple like “just have fun and connect with others” could work.

Consultant: That’s a great mantra! Keeping it simple and focused on connection can guide you throughout the process. How confident do you feel about handling any potential challenges you might face?

User: I think I’m ready to face challenges. I know I might need help, and that’s okay. I’ve realized it’s okay to ask for assistance when I need it.

Consultant: Recognizing the value of seeking help is a significant strength. It shows your growth and willingness to collaborate. As you continue to navigate these social situations, what long-term goals do you envision for yourself in terms of social skills and confidence?

User: I’d like to be someone who feels comfortable in any setting, not just with friends. Maybe even make more friends outside of my usual circles.

Consultant: That’s an admirable goal! Expanding your comfort zone beyond familiar circles will undoubtedly help you grow further. What support systems do you think you can tap into as you work toward this goal?

User: I could ask my teammates for introductions to their friends and share my experiences with my mom. She can be supportive.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Using your teammates and sharing with your mom can provide you with a solid support system. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made and the strategies you've identified?

User: I'm feeling really accomplished! I can see a path forward, and I appreciate our conversation. It helps me clarify my ideas and feel supported.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Xiaoxi. You’ve made tremendous strides, and it’s inspiring to see your progress. Remember to lean on those reminders and support as you continue to grow. If you ever feel uncertain, know that you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the work you've done. I look forward to hearing about your next steps. Take care!
