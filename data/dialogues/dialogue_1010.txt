Consultant: Hello, Bin! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious. I keep worrying about what will happen if I'm called on in class, and it’s affecting my ability to focus during lectures.

Consultant: I can sense how challenging this must be for you. It sounds like the fear of being called on has made you feel quite tense. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious during those moments?

User: I worry that if I answer incorrectly, my classmates will laugh at me again, like what happened in that math class. I feel very exposed when the teacher looks at me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Bin. It makes sense that the experience of being criticized would stay with you and heighten your anxiety. What thoughts go through your mind when you’re in class, especially when you anticipate being asked a question?

User: I often think things like, "I’ll embarrass myself," or "Everyone will see that I don’t know anything." It makes my heart race.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly overwhelming. It seems like they not only increase your anxiety but also impact your overall classroom experience. What emotions do you feel when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel really scared and sometimes even a bit ashamed. I start to sweat, and I just want to disappear.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way in a stressful situation. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. How do you think they contribute to your anxiety?

User: I guess they make me believe that I really will embarrass myself, which makes me more nervous about speaking up. It feels like a never-ending cycle.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging cycle to break. Let's consider this: what evidence do you have that others would laugh at you again? Have there been moments where that didn’t happen?

User: Well, yes. Sometimes my classmates are supportive, and I’ve actually answered questions correctly before. But that one incident keeps replaying in my mind.

Consultant: It’s interesting how one negative experience can overshadow the positive ones. Perhaps we could work on reframing that thought? What would you tell a friend who felt the same way in a class?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to know everything. I guess I need to remind myself about that too.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Bin! Acknowledging that it’s okay to make mistakes can help ease some of the pressure. Let's also think about how you could prepare for potential questions in class. Would that help you feel more at ease?

User: Yes, if I could prepare beforehand, I think I might feel more confident. But I still feel anxious just thinking about being called on.

Consultant: Preparing could definitely build your confidence. Along with that, we could also practice some relaxation techniques to help manage that anxiety when you feel it rising. How would you feel about trying a simple breathing exercise together?

User: That sounds good. I’m willing to try anything that might help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by taking a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, holding it for four counts, and slowly exhaling through your mouth for six counts. Repeat that a few times with me.

User: Okay, let’s do it. 

Consultant: Breathe in… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming. I think I can use this during class if I get anxious.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating this technique could provide you with a sense of control. How do you feel about discussing how to implement this when you anticipate being called on?

User: I think I could do this before class and even in-between questions while I’m waiting.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. It will take practice, but it sounds like you’re starting to find some strategies to help with your anxiety. What are your thoughts on our conversation today?

User: I feel like I’m starting to see a way forward. It helps to talk about all this stuff and realize I’m not alone.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Bin! It’s crucial to recognize that you’re not alone in these feelings. During our next session, we can review your experiences with these strategies and adjust them if needed. 

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely practice the breathing and see how it goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Bin! I’m proud of your willingness to face these challenges. Remember, take it one step at a time. Looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Bin! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last talk? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious, especially in class. I constantly worry about how I perform when the teacher asks questions. This reflection on my performance seems to make my anxiety worse.

Consultant: I understand. Classroom situations can indeed be quite stressful. You want to feel more at ease during participation. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers this anxiety when you're in class?

User: Well, it mostly happens when the teacher asks questions. I feel like everyone's looking at me, and I panic about saying something wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure to perform perfectly is quite overwhelming for you in those moments. Let's explore what thoughts go through your mind when you're faced with those questions. What do you usually think at that time?

User: I often think that if I answer incorrectly, everyone will judge me and think I'm not smart enough. It makes my heart race.

Consultant: That must be really tough to deal with. You mentioned feeling judged if you get an answer wrong. Can you think of any evidence that supports this belief? Or maybe some evidence that contradicts it?

User: I don't really know... I can't remember anyone openly critiquing me, but I fear that they are judging internally.

Consultant: It's understandable to have that fear, but it's important to consider that often, people are more focused on their own thoughts than on evaluating others. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to think about it?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that no one is perfect. They should just try their best.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective! Now, let’s try to adopt that mindset for yourself during class. What if you allow yourself to make mistakes and view them as learning opportunities rather than failures?

User: That sounds easier said than done. I still find it hard to break free from that mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely, it takes practice. We can start small. Next time you're in class, when you feel that anxiety rising, can you remind yourself of that perspective? Maybe even write it down?

User: I could try that. Writing it might help me remember better during class.

Consultant: Great idea! Also, have you noticed how often you actually participate in class discussions? Are there moments where you felt okay speaking up?

User: Yes, there have been times when I felt a bit more comfortable, especially when I prepared in advance.

Consultant: Preparation can definitely boost your confidence. Let’s set a goal to do more of that. How about preparing one or two points before each class? This could ease your anxiety about participating.

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. It makes sense to come in prepared to speak.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. As you begin to prepare and engage, how do you think that will affect your anxiety levels in class?

User: Hopefully, I’ll feel less anxious and more confident speaking up. At least I’ll have something to say.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re replacing anxiety with preparation. As you practice this, pay attention to any changes in your feelings and thoughts about participating. 

User: Okay, I will. It will be a challenge, but I want to try.

Consultant: Remember, it’s perfectly normal for it to take time. Can you commit to reflecting on each class after it happens? Maybe jot down what went well and any areas you’d like to improve.

User: I can do that. Reflecting sounds helpful.

Consultant: Fantastic! Over time, this will help you recognize your progress. Let's check in on how you'll keep track of your feelings during this process. Would you be willing to use a simple anxiety scale every week?

User: Sure. I think that would help me notice changes in my anxiety levels.

Consultant: Wonderful! By keeping track of your feelings, you can visualize how well you're managing anxiety in class. We can review it together in our next session. 

User: That sounds good. I hope to see some improvement.

Consultant: I'm sure you will, Bin! It’s all about taking small steps. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s completely okay to seek help when you need it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Just know that you'll experience ups and downs, but every small effort counts. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: No, I think I've covered everything for now. I feel better talking it out.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! I'm here whenever you need to talk. Remember to use the strategies we discussed and keep practicing. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Yes, I’ll do that. Thank you so much! 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Bin! Take care, and have a wonderful day ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bin! It's great to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my classroom anxiety. I've been trying to reflect on my feelings and figure out what triggers them.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvement. It's really important to recognize your emotions. Can you share with me what specific situations in class still make you feel anxious?

User: Well, I still worry about how I'll perform when I speak up in class. I often think that my responses will seem unhelpful or that people will judge me for it.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let's explore that. When you think about speaking up, what kind of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I usually think, "What if I embarrass myself?" or "Maybe others will think I'm not smart."

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of pressure. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts occur?

User: I feel a rush of anxiety, and it makes me hesitate to participate. I don't want to look foolish.

Consultant: I understand. It's completely natural to fear judgment, especially in a classroom setting. Have you noticed how often these thoughts pop up compared to the times you feel more comfortable?

User: I guess they pop up a lot, especially when the teacher asks for volunteers. But there are moments when I feel okay about sharing my ideas.

Consultant: That's a positive insight! What do you think makes those moments different for you? 

User: I think it’s when I feel prepared or really interested in the topic. I feel like I can connect with what’s being discussed.

Consultant: That’s excellent to notice! When you feel prepared and engaged, your confidence seems to rise. Let’s think about how you can build on those moments. What are some ways you could prepare yourself before class to feel more confident?

User: Maybe I could review the topic beforehand, or even practice what I want to say.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Practice can really help, and having some prepared thoughts might ease your anxiety. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could work. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let’s explore how you can also challenge those negative thoughts about embarrassing yourself. If a friend was in your situation, what kinds of thoughts would you encourage them to have?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not have the perfect answer.

Consultant: Exactly! You deserve that same compassion. Maybe you could replace those negative thoughts with something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes; I’m learning and growing.”

User: That makes sense! I think I can work on that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also talk about how to gently expose yourself to speaking in class. Could you think of small steps you could take in the upcoming week to practice?

User: I think I could start by asking a question during a class. That feels like a manageable step for me.

Consultant: That's an excellent first step, Bin! Asking a question can be a great way to ease into participating. What would you like to ask?

User: Maybe I could ask for clarification on something if I don't understand a topic well. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea! It shows you're engaged and willing to learn. How does it feel to have this plan in place?

User: It makes me feel hopeful. I like that I have small steps to work on.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Let’s also set aside some time each week to reflect on how this goes for you. Keeping track of your successes, no matter how small, can really help build your confidence.

User: Definitely. I can start a journal to jot down my experiences and feelings.

Consultant: I love that idea! Journaling can provide valuable insights and reinforce your progress. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think recognizing my thoughts and preparing ahead are really important. And being kinder to myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Be gentle with yourself as you navigate these challenges. You've made such wonderful progress, and I'm really proud of you. Remember, you have the tools to manage your feelings and boost your confidence.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Bin. I’m looking forward to hearing how your week goes. Keep practicing that positive self-talk, and we’ll catch up again soon! 

User: Sounds good! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Bin! It’s great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially since I've been working on the relaxation exercises and positive self-talk. I even spoke up in class a few times and got some encouraging responses from my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you’ve made some positive progress in participating more in class. Can you share how that experience felt for you?

User: It felt really good! I was nervous at first, but when I saw my classmates reacting positively, it lifted my spirits. I actually started feeling more comfortable speaking up.

Consultant: I’m glad you felt supported. It sounds like this positive reinforcement has helped reduce your anxiety. How do you think this change in classroom participation might impact your self-confidence moving forward?

User: I think it helps a lot! I’m starting to believe in myself more, and it makes me want to participate even more. But I still have that nagging fear before speaking sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel apprehensive before speaking, even with progress. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. What specific thoughts go through your mind right before you speak in class?

User: I often worry that I’ll say something wrong or that my classmates will not take me seriously. It makes me second-guess myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common. It seems like a lot of pressure you’re placing on yourself. How do you feel when you challenge those thoughts momentarily, like considering that your classmates might actually be supportive rather than critical?

User: I guess when I think about it, it’s more comforting. I realize that everyone is there to learn, just like me. But the anxiety still creeps in fast.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Perhaps we can focus on gradually challenging those negative thoughts when they arise. What would happen if you allowed yourself to speak first, without worrying about the potential outcomes? 

User: I suppose if I did that, I might surprise myself and feel accomplished. It’s just tough to break that habit of thinking negatively.

Consultant: It can definitely be tough, but it sounds like you’re already on the right track with your recent experiences. How about we work together to create a small plan for your next class? Maybe you could set a goal of speaking at least once and reflecting on the experience afterward.

User: That sounds doable! I like the idea of having a goal to focus on. I think it could help direct my thoughts better.

Consultant: Great! Let’s tie this to your positive experiences. After you speak in class, how would you like to reinforce that good feeling you have when you receive positive feedback?

User: I can write it down in a journal. I think reflecting on those moments would help a lot!

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling is a fantastic way to reinforce those positive moments and help internalize your successes. How do you feel about creating a “success journal” to track your positive classroom experiences?

User: I like that idea! It would serve as a reminder for me when I feel anxious again. 

Consultant: Exactly, it’s a wonderful tool! Remember, it’s about building a collection of your achievements that you can lean on when you’re feeling uncertain. Have you thought about ways we can practice outside of class too?

User: I think I could try speaking in smaller group settings with friends or even practicing presentations. That could help ease the anxiety for the next class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Gradual exposure in a comfortable setting can significantly reduce anxiety. How about planning a casual study group with your friends, where you could share insights and practice together?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely arrange that. I believe it can help me feel more prepared. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember to celebrate each step you take. After your study group, take a moment to reflect on how it felt to share your thoughts. 

User: I will! I feel excited about this plan. I hope to feel more at ease with each attempt.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’re committed to doing. You’ll have your goal of speaking in class, start a success journal, and practice in smaller groups. 

User: Yes, that’s correct! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: I’m proud of your progress, Bin. Remember, it’s about building on what you've achieved so far. We’ll check back on your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your successes. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bin! It’s great to see you again. I'm looking forward to hearing how you've been doing since our last session. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. My confidence in class has improved a lot, and I'm participating more in extracurricular activities. But I still want to make sure I can keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's impressive that you're engaging more and feeling confident. What specific goals do you have in mind to maintain this positive state?

User: I want to keep my confidence level high and also improve my academic performance. I guess I'm just worried about not slipping back into feeling anxious when it comes to studying.

Consultant: I completely understand that concern. Maintaining a balance between your confidence in activities and your academic progress is important. Can you share what strategies or actions you've been using to stay confident and engaged in class?

User: Well, I’ve been participating in discussions more and trying to contribute to group work. I also spend time studying in a quieter environment which seems to help a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Engaging in discussions and creating a conducive study environment can definitely boost your confidence and performance. Have you noticed any particular thoughts or feelings that arise when you study, especially when you think about your past experiences with anxiety?

User: Sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about past failures—especially during exams in high school. But I try to redirect my focus to the present and what I can do now.

Consultant: That’s a very mature and proactive way to handle those overwhelming thoughts. When those past experiences resurface, what do you usually tell yourself to stay focused on the present?

User: I remind myself that I’m in a different place now—my grades are good and I'm more involved. I tell myself that I've worked hard to become better at handling things.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reminder, Bin. It’s important to acknowledge your progress. Let’s focus a bit on those moments when you feel anxious about your studies. Are there any specific situations or aspects of your academic life that still trigger those feelings?

User: Yes, the thought of major assignments or exams can still make me anxious. I worry about whether I can perform well despite my improvements.

Consultant: It’s completely common to feel anxious about assignments and exams, even when you’re doing well. Let’s explore what goes through your mind when you're faced with these major tasks. What thoughts tend to arise?

User: I guess I usually think, “What if I fail?” or “What if I can’t meet everyone’s expectations?” Those thoughts make me doubt myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It's normal to have such concerns, but they can also create unnecessary pressure. How do you feel when you recognize these thoughts while preparing for an assignment or exam?

User: I feel a bit defeated and start to doubt my abilities. But I try to push through and keep studying.

Consultant: It’s great that you push through, but let’s also think about challenging those defeating thoughts. When you think, “What if I fail?”, what evidence do you have to support that thought? Are there any counterexamples from your recent experiences?

User: Well, I did well in my last project, and I got positive feedback from my professors. I guess it’s not fair to keep expecting failure.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve demonstrated your abilities through your recent successes. Let’s try to shift that negative thought into something more balanced. How about reframing it to, “I have the skills to succeed, and I can handle challenges as they come”?

User: That sounds more positive, actually. I can definitely give that a try.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Practicing this kind of reframing regularly can help you manage those anxious thoughts more effectively. Now, as we move forward, what kinds of activities or practices do you think could help you maintain this mindset and continue building your confidence?

User: I think practicing mindfulness techniques could help me when I start feeling anxious. I can also keep participating in discussions to build my confidence.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Mindfulness can really help in managing anxiety, and continuing to be active in discussions will strengthen your communication skills. Would you like to set some specific goals or a plan for how to incorporate these practices into your routine?

User: Sure! I could start with a daily mindfulness practice and set a goal to participate in at least one discussion per class. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Daily mindfulness combined with active participation could create a strong foundation for your continued growth. How do you feel about this plan going forward?

User: I feel hopeful. It gives me something to focus on, and I think it will help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to experience any fluctuations in your emotions as you enact this plan. How about we revisit our goals and progress together in our next session to see how you’re feeling?

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I’d like to review my progress and see how well the mindfulness and participation are working for me.

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it. Before we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to summarize what you’ve learned and how you can keep practicing these strategies until our next meeting.

User: I learned that I can challenge my anxious thoughts and reframe them positively. Practicing mindfulness and participating more should help me stay confident.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you’ll continue to do well. Remember, maintaining a balanced mindset is a journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don't hesitate to reach out. Our conversations are a part of your support system.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and guidance. I feel much more equipped to handle challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Bin! It’s been a pleasure working together. I’m excited to see your continued growth. Take care, and I’ll see you in our next session!

User: See you! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bin! It’s great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been doing well overall. The pressure of the final exams is building up, but I’ve been managing my emotions and staying on track with my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve been able to handle the stress effectively. Can you share more about the strategies or techniques you've been using to maintain this stability?

User: Sure! I’ve been practicing some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, whenever I feel overwhelmed. It really helps to bring me back to a calmer state.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic strategy for managing anxiety. I’m glad it’s working for you. Have you noticed any particular situations or thoughts that trigger anxiety for you during this time?

User: Sometimes, when I think about how much I need to study and the amount of material I have to cover, I feel a bit anxious. But I try to remind myself that I can tackle one thing at a time.

Consultant: That’s a good approach—breaking things down can make them feel more manageable. How effective do you find that reminder when you’re feeling anxious? 

User: It helps most of the time, but I still have moments when I feel the pressure building. I guess I have to work on my mindset a little more.

Consultant: It’s normal to experience pressure, especially during exam times. Let’s explore that mindset a bit. When thoughts of pressure arise, what are some specific thoughts that come to mind?

User: I often think, “What if I don’t do well?” or “I can’t let my family down.” Those kinds of thoughts really amplify my stress.

Consultant: Those are very common thoughts in high-pressure situations. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, especially with family expectations. How do you feel when those thoughts occur?

User: They make me feel anxious and sometimes a bit hopeless, like I can’t meet my own or my family’s expectations.

Consultant: I understand. That sense of hopelessness can be quite challenging. Let’s try to challenge those negative thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Is there any evidence against them?

User: Well, I have done well in my studies before, and I’ve worked hard this semester. I guess there’s a part of me that knows I can do it, but the fear just seems to overpower it sometimes.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Bin. Acknowledging your past successes is crucial. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their fears and capabilities?

User: I would probably tell them that they have already proven themselves and that they shouldn’t let fear take control. They just need to focus on doing their best.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive way to view it. Can we try to apply that same kindness to yourself? What would it look like if you treated yourself as you would a friend?

User: I think I would be more forgiving of my mistakes and remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to adopt! Allowing yourself grace can help reduce the pressure you feel. As we continue, how about we brainstorm some positive affirmations or reminders you can use during your study sessions?

User: Yes, I’d like that! Maybe something like, “I’ve prepared well, and I can handle this”?

Consultant: That sounds excellent! Affirmations like that can be very empowering. How do you think you can incorporate them into your study routine?

User: I could write them down in my planner or say them out loud before I start studying each day.

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan. Speaking of your study routine, what other practical activities can you incorporate to help sustain your emotional stability as exams approach?

User: I think scheduling regular breaks would help. I tend to study for long periods without taking a break, and that makes me feel drained.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular breaks can significantly improve productivity and help maintain a clear mind. What activities do you think could refresh you during those breaks?

User: I enjoy going for walks or listening to music. I could plan to do those during my study breaks.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! Mixing physical activity and relaxation can indeed recharge your energy. How are you planning to follow through with this new routine?

User: I can set timers for my study sessions and make a commitment to myself to take those breaks seriously.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Following through with those intentions can really help you maintain both your focus and emotional health. Now, as we are approaching the end of our session, could you share what you've found most helpful in our discussions today?

User: I think recognizing that I have the ability to succeed and learning how to challenge my negative thoughts has been really helpful. It feels good to know I can be kinder to myself.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’ve gained insight from our conversation, Bin! Reflecting on your progress and strategies helps reinforce your growth. What do you think will be your biggest focus moving forward, especially with final exams approaching?

User: I want to continue practicing self-compassion and stay positive, even when I feel stressed. I think that will help me perform better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic focus! Self-compassion can make a significant difference in your well-being. Remember, it’s alright to seek help whenever you need it. Today marks the end of our scheduled sessions, but you can always reach out if you need support in the future. How are you feeling about the journey we’ve had together?

User: I feel grateful for all the insights I've gained. It's been a healthy process for me, and I’m more prepared for what’s ahead.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You've accomplished a lot during our sessions and made significant strides. Best of luck with your exams, and remember to take care of yourself along the way!
