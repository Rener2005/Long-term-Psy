Consultant: Hi Xiaoxiang, I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since the last time we talked?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty angry and confused. I got into trouble at school for fighting, and I don't really understand why it's such a big deal. I was just acting like the characters in the cartoons I watch.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and maybe some unfairness. Could you share what happened that led to the fight?

User: Well, there was this argument with another kid, and I hit him. But I didn't really think it was wrong at the time—I thought it was just what people do when they're mad.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you might not know how to express your feelings differently, especially if you've seen those actions in cartoons. Let's explore how acting like the characters you've seen might lead to misunderstandings or trouble, especially in real-life situations.

User: I guess the teachers and my parents didn't like it. But it still bothers me, because it feels normal to me.

Consultant: It's important to find a way to express your anger or frustration that doesn't lead to fights or getting into trouble. How do you think your actions might have made the other person feel?

User: Probably scared or mad too, I guess. But I didn't think about it at the time.

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Recognizing the impact of our actions on others is an essential part of understanding the rules that help us get along with people. What do you think might be a different way to handle it next time?

User: Maybe I could just walk away or tell a teacher? But that seems kind of hard to do when I'm upset.

Consultant: It can definitely be tough in the moment. How about we practice some new ways of expressing your feelings when you're upset? We can do this through role-playing so you can feel more prepared.

User: Okay, I guess we can try that.

Consultant: Great! So, let's imagine a situation where you're starting to feel angry. You can practice using words to describe how you're feeling instead of hitting. What might you say?

User: Umm, maybe I could say, "I'm really mad right now because you took my toy"?

Consultant: That's a good start, Xiaoxiang. It helps others understand what's bothering you without feeling threatened. How does it feel to say it that way?

User: Feels kind of weird, but not too bad.

Consultant: Sometimes new ways to express feelings can seem strange at first. With practice, it'll become more natural. What can you think of as a way to calm down when you start to feel upset?

User: I could count to ten or take deep breaths. I've heard about doing that.

Consultant: Excellent ideas! Both counting and deep breathing can help you keep calm and think about what to do next. What do you think your next steps could be to use these strategies at school?

User: I could try to remember them when I get mad. Maybe even tell my mom or dad when I'm having a hard time with it.

Consultant: That sounds like a useful plan. Having their support can make things easier. Over time, these new strategies will become more familiar and part of your routine. How do you feel about the possibility of using these approaches in the future?

User: It still feels a bit difficult, but I think I can give it a try.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way starting out. Could you also think about speaking with your teachers to let them know you’re trying to change how you handle anger?

User: But what if they don't believe me?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. We could think of how to explain your intentions sincerely. If you'd like, we can practice that together, too.

User: Yeah, that might help.

Consultant: Wonderful, Xiaoxiang. This is all part of developing new skills. By doing this, you'll be able to enhance your confidence and communicate better with those around you. How does this plan feel to you now?

User: It makes me feel a bit better, like there might be a way to fix things.

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear. Let's keep exploring these methods and practice when you feel ready. Together, we’ll work on building a stronger sense of security and understanding of your value. Remember, I’m here to help guide you through this process.

User: Thanks, I appreciate that.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoxiang. You've taken an important step by being open and willing to try new strategies. What would you like to focus on before the end of our session today?

User: Maybe we can practice more on how to talk about feelings without getting angry or hitting?

Consultant: Absolutely. Let’s dive into a few more role-playing exercises to strengthen your skills in expressing emotions constructively. This will be a key tool in making your frustrations heard without conflict. Are you ready to begin?

User: Yeah, let's try it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s start with a scenario where someone says something that bothers you. Picture this: You're on the playground, and someone says, "You're not good at this game." How might you respond using words to express your feelings?

User: I could say, "It makes me feel bad when you say that. I'm trying my best."

Consultant: That's an excellent response. It shows you're sharing your feelings while also standing up for yourself. How do you feel practicing that now?

User: It feels a bit easier than before.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Practicing these skills will help make it more comfortable over time. As we wrap up our session today, what’s one new thing you’re taking away that you’re excited to try?

User: I'm going to try telling people how I feel instead of hitting them. And maybe try counting to ten to calm down.

Consultant: Those are great steps forward, Xiaoxiang. I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Remember that you have support from your family and teachers as you practice these new skills. What will you do next if you find yourself in a difficult situation?

User: I'll try to use my words first and remember the breathing exercises.

Consultant: That's a strong plan. You're developing new ways to navigate challenging emotions, and that's an important skill. I'm here anytime you want to talk more or practice further. Keep these strategies with you as you move forward.

User: Thank you. I'll do my best.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoxiang. Believe in yourself—you're capable of making positive changes. I look forward to hearing more about your experiences and achievements in our future sessions. Take care until then.

User: Thank you, goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiaoxiang. Take care!

Consultant: Hi Xiao Xiang, I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. It's been confusing. After the recent parent-teacher meeting, my parents started arguing again about how they should raise me. It makes me wonder if I'm just not good enough.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Xiao Xiang. It sounds quite overwhelming. Have you noticed how these arguments make you feel, or what thoughts come to your mind when they happen?

User: I feel like I'm the reason for their arguments. Maybe if I was better behaved or did better in school, they wouldn't argue so much.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let's explore these thoughts together. Do you think it's all your responsibility for their disagreements, or could there be other reasons behind their different views?

User: I don't know... It's just that when they argue, they mention me, like they can't agree on how to deal with my issues.

Consultant: It might seem centered on you, but there might be more going on in their relationship. They love you and want the best, even if their methods differ. Can you remember a moment when you felt like you were valued, regardless of their disagreements?

User: Sometimes my mom says I'm creative, especially when I draw. But at school, I’m often told to behave better, so I doubt if that's true.

Consultant: Your creativity is a wonderful asset. It's important to hold onto those affirmations. What if you started acknowledging these positive traits during challenging times, like drawing when you feel upset? How do you think that could change your perspective?

User: Maybe… maybe it could distract me or make me feel better about myself during those times.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. Could we also talk about how language can be a powerful tool for expression? It can help convey your feelings in a more positive light compared to physical expressions.

User: I don't know if I can do that. I'm not very good at talking about my feelings.

Consultant: That's completely okay and something many people experience. How do you feel about trying to slowly incorporate more verbal expressions at home? We could even do some practice here.

User: I guess I could try... but what if I mess up?

Consultant: It's all about practicing and understanding that it's perfectly fine to make mistakes. What matters is that you're willing to try. How about we role-play a scenario now? You can choose what situation to focus on.

User: Maybe... let’s say I'm upset about watching TV time being limited by my dad.

Consultant: Alright, imagine I'm your dad. You could start by saying how you feel when that happens and suggest an alternate time or activity that could work for both of you.

User: Okay, um... "Dad, I feel upset when I can't watch TV. Can we find a time that works for you and me for watching my favorite show?"

Consultant: That was great, Xiao Xiang! How did it feel to express yourself with words?

User: It felt strange, but not as hard as I thought it would be. I think I might be able to try this at home.

Consultant: That's a fantastic step forward. Remember, you're learning a new skill, and developing these habits can take time. Do you think this approach could also be useful in school with teachers and friends?

User: I suppose it could. Maybe I wouldn't get into as much trouble if I spoke up instead of reacting physically.

Consultant: Exactly, practicing this new way of expressing might help in various situations. What about exploring why you sometimes feel the need to show anger through physical means?

User: Maybe... because it feels like people notice me more when I do something big like that. But it's not always good attention.

Consultant: It's insightful that you've recognized that. What if we worked on ways to gain positive attention? Since you mentioned drawing earlier, what about showing your artwork to others more often?

User: That's an idea. I usually keep them to myself, but maybe showing them could be good.

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to share something positive and a part of who you are with others. Before we end today, how are you feeling about understanding and expressing your emotions moving forward?

User: I'm still a bit unsure, but I feel like I have some tools to start trying different things. The practice makes me a bit hopeful.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have. Remember, each attempt is a step towards learning and growing. Would you like to plan another session to continue exploring these ideas further?

User: Yes, I think that would really help. Thanks for guiding me through this today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Xiang. I'm looking forward to helping you on this journey to better understanding and expressing your feelings. See you next time!

Consultant: Hi there, Xiaoxiang! I'm glad you're back for another session. Last time, we talked about the importance of expressing your feelings verbally. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit down. I tried speaking up in public recently, but I said something wrong and got laughed at by my classmates. Now I'm doubting if I should even try to express myself with words.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoxiang. It's completely understandable to feel uncertain after such an experience. Let's explore this a bit—what made this attempt feel particularly challenging for you?

User: I felt embarrassed. It's like the moment I decided to speak, everyone was just waiting for me to make a mistake. I just felt so exposed and it made me question whether I know how to express myself.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed can be really uncomfortable. It's important to remember that trying something new can feel awkward at first—especially speaking in front of others. It's a learning process, and mistakes are a part of growing. What do you think you can learn from this experience?

User: Maybe I rushed into speaking without thinking it through. I guess I could try to be more prepared next time, so I'm more confident about what I'm saying.

Consultant: That's a great reflection, Xiaoxiang. Being prepared can definitely help increase your confidence. Have there been any small successes or positive moments since our last session that you can think of where you felt good about expressing yourself?

User: There was one time when I managed to tell my teacher that I didn't understand something in class instead of just pretending I got it. She helped me, and it felt really nice to use words instead of getting frustrated.

Consultant: That's an important step, Xiaoxiang! Speaking up about not understanding something takes a lot of courage and is a form of successful communication. How did it feel to receive help because you expressed your need?

User: It felt relieving and made me realize that words can actually help me get what I need sometimes. But then, I go back to getting teased, and it's hard to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Balancing those feelings can be difficult. It's a huge step that you recognized the positive impact of using your words, though. Would you be open to trying out some small group activities that could help strengthen your verbal communication skills?

User: That sounds interesting. I'm not sure how well I'll do, but I'm willing to try.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Xiaoxiang! With small group activities, you'd get to practice speaking in a supportive environment. It's like a safe space to make mistakes and learn from them. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I like the idea of having a safe place to practice before doing it for real. It might help me not be so scared next time.

Consultant: Absolutely. By gradually building up your skills and confidence, those situations that once felt daunting can become more manageable. What interests you most about this opportunity to practice with others?

User: I think it's knowing that I won't be judged too harshly. And maybe I'll find some new friends who feel the same way as I do.

Consultant: Finding understanding peers can be incredibly encouraging. They can offer support, and you might even find new ways to help each other express thoughts and feelings. How do you feel about starting with these group exercises to see how they go?

User: I'm a bit nervous, but also curious and excited. It's nice to think that there could be positive outcomes from this.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a mix of emotions. Let's take this step by step, and remember, your efforts are what truly matter. Can we think of some everyday situations at home or school where you might practice expressing yourself, even just a little bit?

User: I could try telling my mom more about my day, or even just ask my dad questions about his work. It might give me more to talk about and slowly ease me into expressing myself more.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Sharing more about your day or asking questions opens up conversations that might otherwise be missed. And how do you think you'll feel once these become easier for you?

User: I hope I'll feel more at ease and confident. Like, even if I make mistakes, they'll be less scary and I'll just keep getting better.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset, Xiaoxiang. It's about progress, not perfection, and each step forward is significant. Let's also think about how you'll record these experiences. Keeping a journal might help you reflect on your successes and where you could improve. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. Writing things down might help me see just how much I'm improving over time.

Consultant: Perfect, Xiaoxiang. It's a fantastic way to track your journey and notice the good moments more vividly. As we wrap up for today, what are you taking away from our conversation?

User: I think I've realized that expressing myself with words is worth the effort, despite the setbacks. And I'm eager to try group activities and journaling to keep making progress.

Consultant: That's a great takeaway. You're already showing so much growth, Xiaoxiang. We'll continue to build on this foundation in our future sessions. Remember, every effort counts, and I'm here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit more hopeful now, knowing I have this plan.

Consultant: You're doing fantastic, Xiaoxiang. Keep up the good work, and I'll see you in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoxiang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident lately. After that school activity where I shared my ideas, and they were accepted, it felt really good.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like expressing yourself through words instead of actions had a positive impact. How did receiving that recognition affect you emotionally?

User: It made me feel proud and a bit excited. I realized that I can make my point without getting angry or physical.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're recognizing the benefits of verbal communication. Have you thought about any situations where you might want to try expressing yourself again through words rather than actions?

User: Yes, I actually want to try it more, especially in the class group projects. I think it could make things easier and more fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity. Let's think about a situation that might come up in a group project. How might you express an idea or feeling to your classmates?

User: I might try to calmly tell them what I think we should do and why, instead of just getting frustrated if things don't go as planned.

Consultant: That's a good approach. Would you feel comfortable practicing that with me? We can role-play a scenario where you share an idea in a group setting.

User: Sure, let's try that. It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Alright, imagine you're in a group, and you have an idea about how to start a project. How would you begin to express your thoughts to the group?

User: I think I'd start by saying something like, "I have an idea about where we could start. What if we..."

Consultant: That's a great start! It opens the conversation for input and collaboration. How do you think your classmates might respond to that?

User: They might be more willing to listen and share their own thoughts, making it a better discussion.

Consultant: Exactly. By expressing your thoughts clearly and calmly, you create an atmosphere of respect and teamwork. Have you had any chance to try something like this in a real situation yet?

User: Not yet, but I'm looking forward to the next opportunity. I even talked to a few classmates about it, and they seemed interested.

Consultant: That's promising. Those conversations are already steps in the right direction. How did those informal chats make you feel?

User: They made me feel more connected and less anxious about speaking up. I think I'm slowly getting better at it.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization. Remember, every small step you take towards using your words is progress. Do you have any concerns or fears about using this new approach?

User: Sometimes I worry I'll forget what to say or that my ideas won't make sense, and I'll end up looking silly.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but with more practice, you'll gain confidence. What could you do if you find yourself stuck during a discussion?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath or even prepare some notes beforehand to guide me.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Preparation can really help reinforce your confidence. How do you envision applying these skills to the upcoming performance event?

User: I hope to speak clearly and confidently during the performance. I'd like to showcase my progress and communicate well with my team.

Consultant: That's an admirable goal. What sort of preparations do you think will help you succeed in this event?

User: I want to practice my lines and maybe talk through my parts with someone to make sure I'm clear on everything.

Consultant: Practicing can certainly make a big difference. Who could you practice with, someone who supports you?

User: I could practice with a friend from the group or even at home with my parents. They always encourage me to do my best.

Consultant: Having supportive people around really helps. How do you feel about asking for feedback from them after your practice?

User: I think I'd like that. Feedback could point out parts where I can improve, which would be helpful.

Consultant: It's great you're open to feedback—it shows your commitment to getting better. What are some positive outcomes you hope to see after this next event?

User: I want to feel proud of how I performed and maybe get some nice comments from the teachers or my friends.

Consultant: Those are very achievable outcomes, and I believe you will reach them. Last time, we discussed keeping up this positive outlook—what keeps you motivated?

User: I think remembering how good it felt to be recognized last time pushes me to try again. Seeing progress motivates me too.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. The more you focus on these positive experiences, the easier it becomes to pursue them. What's your plan for maintaining this momentum?

User: I'll keep working on my communication and stay open to new challenges. I hope to keep learning from each experience.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset, Xiaoxiang. Remember, each opportunity to practice is a step towards greater confidence. I'm looking forward to seeing how you continue to grow.

User: Thank you! I'm excited to keep working on this and see where it leads.

Consultant: You're doing amazing work. Keep that enthusiasm, and you'll achieve great things. Is there anything else you'd like to explore in our sessions?

User: Not at the moment. I just want to keep improving my communication and confidence step by step.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan. Feel free to reach out whenever you need guidance or want to share your progress. Keep up the great efforts!

User: I will. Thanks so much for your support!

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoxiang. Till our next session, keep growing and exploring. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, it's great to see you again, Xiaoxiang. I remember from our last conversation that you're excited about the upcoming drama club performance. How are you feeling as it approaches?

User: Hi. I'm really excited but also a bit nervous. I really want to do well and show everyone that I've improved, but sometimes I worry I might forget my lines or mess up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous before a performance. Let's explore some ways you can manage those feelings and stay confident. How do you usually feel when it's time to perform, and what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I might make a mistake and people will laugh at me. It makes my heart race, and I start to doubt myself, even though I really want to impress my teachers and classmates.

Consultant: I understand that must be challenging. Let's work on shifting those thoughts. What if we could replace that doubt with some positive, encouraging thoughts? What would you tell a friend who felt the same way?

User: I guess I would tell them that it's okay to be nervous and that they should just try their best. No one is perfect, and making mistakes is part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly, everyone makes mistakes, and they're opportunities to learn. How about we try a simple exercise? Next time you rehearse, tell yourself, "I'm doing my best, and that's enough." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I can try that. It might make me feel a bit more at ease while practicing my lines.

Consultant: Great! Let's also incorporate some relaxation techniques to help calm those nerves. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises?

User: No, I haven't really tried anything like that before. How does it work?

Consultant: It's simple. You just take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Repeat this a few times. It helps soothe the mind and body, making you feel more centered.

User: I'll give it a try. I think feeling more calm would really help me focus better on my performance.

Consultant: I'm glad you’re open to trying it. Another thing that might help is visualizing yourself successfully performing. Picture yourself on stage, doing everything just right. How does that visualization feel?

User: It makes me feel excited and less anxious. I can see myself remembering everything and enjoying the performance.

Consultant: That's wonderful. Keep that image in your mind whenever you feel those nerves creeping in. Remember, you're capable and prepared. What other thoughts could you remind yourself of?

User: I could remind myself that I've practiced a lot and that my teachers believe in me. I should trust in my preparation.

Consultant: Absolutely, trust in yourself and your hard work. With the breathing exercises, positive self-talk, and visualization, you're equipping yourself with great tools. How confident are you feeling about using these new strategies during your performance?

User: I feel much more confident about it now. I think these strategies will help me stay calm and focused. I can't wait to see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for embracing these new approaches. Always remember, it's about enjoying the process and expressing yourself. What will be your biggest takeaway from our session today?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is knowing that the nerves are normal and that I have ways to manage them. Being kind to myself and trusting my preparation makes me feel more ready.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiaoxiang. I'm confident you'll do great. As you head into your performance, what’s the one thing you want to remind yourself?

User: I'll remind myself that I'm prepared, and it's okay to have fun and enjoy the experience. It's my chance to show what I've learned.

Consultant: Perfect! Just remember, we're always here to help along the way. I look forward to hearing how it all goes. If you have any concerns or need more guidance, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I'll let you know how the performance turns out. I'm feeling much better and ready to take it on now.

Consultant: It's my pleasure. Best of luck with your performance, and remember to have fun! I'm sure you’ll do amazingly well. Talk soon!
