Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I'm glad you're here today. I understand there’s been a lot on your mind lately. Can you share what’s been troubling you?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really anxious since entering the new school year. The workload has increased significantly and my performance on the entrance exam wasn’t good at all, which makes me feel like I’m letting my parents down.

Consultant: It sounds like the increased pressure in school and your parents' expectations are weighing heavily on you. Let’s explore this further. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you worry about your performance?

User: I often think that if I don’t get good grades, my parents will be disappointed in me. Sometimes I even feel like I’m just not smart enough to handle this.

Consultant: It seems that you’re carrying a lot of pressure from those expectations, and it’s impacting your confidence in your abilities. If I may ask, how does thinking you’re not smart enough affect your feelings and actions?

User: When I think that way, I just feel hopeless and it’s hard to concentrate on studying. I often procrastinate because I’m scared of failing again.

Consultant: I understand. That feeling of hopelessness can create a cycle that makes it even harder to focus. Let’s try to break this down a bit. Can you recall a time when you felt successful or proud of your achievements in school?

User: Well, there were times in the past when I did well in certain subjects. I remember being really happy after receiving good grades in English. 

Consultant: That’s a great memory! It shows you are capable of success. How did you feel during those times, and what do you think contributed to those achievements?

User: I felt really confident and motivated when I was doing well in English. I think it helped that I enjoyed the subject and found the material interesting.

Consultant: That’s really important to recognize. Enjoying what you study can help boost your confidence. How might you use that realization to change your current study approach or mindset towards your subjects?

User: I guess I could try to find ways to make my study sessions more enjoyable, maybe by incorporating things I like to learn about into my study routine.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach! Balancing the challenging material with subjects or methods you enjoy could help alleviate some pressure. Are there specific subjects where you feel more confident that you could start with?

User: I think I can start with English. I feel more comfortable there, and then maybe I can tackle the harder subjects afterward.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Starting with a subject you feel confident in can build your motivation. Let’s take a moment to think about the pressures you're facing. What else do you think contributes to your feelings of stress regarding school?

User: I feel like there’s a lot of competition among my classmates. Seeing others do well makes me worry even more. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stressed when comparing yourself to others. Let’s reflect on that comparison. What evidence do you have that suggests you are not doing well compared to them?

User: Sometimes I see their grades and achievements, and I focus on my own mistakes instead of my strengths.

Consultant: Those negative comparisons can be very draining and often overlook your own achievements. Could we challenge that perspective? If a friend were to come to you feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably remind them of their successes and encourage them to focus on their own path instead of comparing themselves to others.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach! Applying that same kindness to yourself can be beneficial. How about creating a list of your own strengths and achievements? Would that help bolster your confidence?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think it would help to remind myself of what I can do well.

Consultant: Excellent! This list can serve as a reminder during tough times. Now, let’s discuss some practical steps you can take to manage the anxiety. What activities make you feel relaxed or happy outside of schoolwork?

User: I really enjoy listening to music and drawing. They usually help me unwind when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are wonderful outlets for relaxation! How about incorporating more music and drawing into your daily routine, especially during study breaks? 

User: Yes! I think that would really help me take my mind off things for a bit and recharge.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Balancing study time with enjoyable activities can help manage stress effectively. As we start to wrap up, what strategies are you considering to help you cope with your feelings moving forward?

User: I’ll try to focus on my strengths, make studying more enjoyable, and manage my time better with breaks for music and drawing.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! It’s important to remember that feeling pressure is normal, and you have the tools to manage it effectively. Do you feel more equipped to handle these challenges now?

User: Yes, I do! I feel a bit more hopeful about dealing with my stress and focusing on my studies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to talk about these feelings whenever they arise. If you encounter challenges or feel overwhelmed again, reach out for support. It was great to chat with you today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. I’ll definitely keep in mind what we talked about!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jiajia. Keep practicing those strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi. I’ve been really overwhelmed. With the mid-term exams just around the corner, I feel so much pressure to perform well, and it’s hard to manage everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing significant pressure with your studies. Can you tell me more about how this pressure is affecting you and your daily routine?

User: I find it hard to focus on my studies. I often sit down to study but then get distracted or just feel like I can’t start. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand how frustrating that must be for you. It seems like this pressure is making it difficult to concentrate. What kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you try to start studying?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, my parents will be disappointed in me. That really stresses me out.

Consultant: Feeling like your parents have high expectations can be very stressful. You mentioned the thought of disappointing them; can you share what emotions come up for you in these moments?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. It’s like, no matter how much I study, I doubt it will be enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you would feel anxious and hopeless under such pressure. It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle of stress for you. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking that might be contributing to these feelings?

User: I often think that I must ace everything. If I don’t get a perfect score, I see it as a failure, which makes me not want to study at all sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a significant belief, Jiajia. It seems like viewing anything less than perfect as a failure adds extra pressure on you. Let's try to challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that not scoring perfectly is a failure?

User: I know it’s probably not true—my parents tell me that doing my best is what matters. But I still can’t shake the feeling. 

Consultant: It’s great that your parents focus on your effort rather than just the results. How would you feel if you thought of your efforts and progress as more important than perfect scores?

User: I think I’d feel a lot less pressure. I guess it would make studying more enjoyable, but I’m not sure how to change my mindset.

Consultant: Changing your mindset can take time, and it’s okay to work on this gradually. Let’s explore some alternatives to your current thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, "I must get a perfect score," what if you thought, "I will do my best, and that is enough"?

User: That sounds better. I’d probably feel relieved if I could think like that. 

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember, it’s about recognizing progress rather than perfection. Now, let’s consider how you can manage your time better. Have you tried breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable parts?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just sit down to study for a long time, but then I get overwhelmed.

Consultant: Breaking study time into smaller segments can make it feel less daunting. For instance, you could study for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Would you be willing to try that approach?

User: Yes, that seems reasonable. I think I could manage short bursts of studying.

Consultant: Excellent! Also, during those breaks, do something you enjoy—maybe listen to music or stretch a bit. It can help refresh your mind for the next study session. 

User: That sounds good! I do enjoy listening to music. 

Consultant: Great! Incorporating your interests into breaks can help you maintain your motivation. How do you feel about implementing this study strategy?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to have a plan instead of just feeling lost. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s revisit how you’re managing your thoughts about expectations and your study process over the next few sessions. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I just really want to improve my mindset and be more resilient under pressure.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal, and I believe you can achieve it with practice. Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs in your learning journey. What do you think will be your biggest challenge in applying these strategies?

User: I think it will be hard to stop feeling like I have to be perfect. That thought creeps back in easily. 

Consultant: Acknowledging those challenges is a great step. When you notice those thoughts returning, you can remind yourself of the new perspectives we’ve discussed. What’s a specific moment you can practice this mindset shift in the coming week?

User: Maybe during my study sessions when I feel overwhelmed, I’ll try to remind myself that doing my best is enough.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! I’ll be excited to hear how it goes next time we meet. Keep being kind to yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel a little lighter talking about it today.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that, Jiajia! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to seek help and talk about your feelings. I look forward to our next session where we can continue this journey together. 

User: Yes, me too! I feel more equipped to face it now. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Until next time, take care of yourself and remember the strategies we discussed. Goodbye for now!

Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. I understand you’ve been feeling pressured about your studies lately. Can you tell me a bit more about your feelings and what’s been happening?

User: Hi! Yeah, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. I started trying some new study methods, but the pressure from needing to do well on exams is just too much. I find myself wanting to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: I see, it sounds like that pressure is making it hard for you to focus on your studies. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, especially when there are high expectations. Can you share what those new study methods are and how they’ve been working for you?

User: I’ve been trying to make a study schedule and group things by subjects. I thought it would help, but I often feel like I can't stick to it. When I sit down to study, I just feel this urge to do anything else.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It’s great that you’re trying new methods, but it’s natural to feel some resistance when changes are happening. When you feel that urge to avoid studying, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I usually think that I’m not good enough to stick to the plan, or that I’ll just mess up on the exams anyway. It makes me want to just give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts you mentioned can be quite powerful and might be leading to that feeling of wanting to give up. Let’s take a moment to examine them. You said you feel like you’re not good enough. How true do you think that is when you consider your past successes?

User: Well, I have done well in some subjects before, but when I face something tough, those thoughts just take over.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those thoughts, especially in tough situations. However, it might help to find alternative ways to think about your abilities. If a friend was struggling like this, what would you tell them about their strengths or potential?

User: I would probably remind them of their past achievements and encourage them to keep going. I guess I could do that for myself too. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to offer yourself the same kindness and understanding that you would give to a friend. Let’s explore some specific achievements that you can remind yourself of during these tough times. What are some successes you’ve had in your studies?

User: Well, I did well in my last math exam, and I remember getting a good score on the history project too.

Consultant: Those are fantastic achievements, Jiajia! It sounds like you have a solid track record. We can utilize those reminders to challenge the negative thoughts you’re experiencing. When you catch yourself thinking you’re not good enough, try reflecting on those successes instead. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense! It feels a bit better to think about those times when I did good.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, let’s think about what steps you can take to gradually ease into your study plan without feeling overwhelmed. What small actions can you take this week to start your study sessions?

User: Maybe I could start with just 20 minutes of studying a subject each day instead of trying to cover everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable approach! It’s about creating small, achievable goals. How do you plan to reward yourself after those study sessions?

User: I could allow myself to watch an episode of my favorite show or have some time on my phone.

Consultant: Perfect! Rewards can be a great motivator. Now, when you start feeling that urge to avoid studying, remember that it’s okay to feel that way but see if you can just commit to those 20 minutes first. Would you be open to trying that this week? 

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels less daunting already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jiajia! I believe you have the potential to tackle your study challenges with this new mindset. As we move forward, what do you hope to feel by the end of our next session?

User: I hope to feel a little more confident about my ability to manage my time and studies.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Building that confidence is essential and can even help you face upcoming challenges more effectively. Let’s make sure we revisit your progress on this next time we meet. We will also talk about any obstacles you face along the way. 

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress as well! Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. You’re taking important steps, and that’s what matters most. 

User: Thank you! It feels good to know I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re definitely not alone, Jiajia. We’ll continue to work together, and I’m here to support you. Take care, and see you next time! 

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling about your studies and overall situation lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my studies since my mid-term exams. My grades improved, which gave me a little boost in confidence. But I still have some worries about the next steps.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've seen improvement and gained some confidence! Can you share more about what specific worries you have regarding your studies moving forward?

User: Well, I’m just afraid that the improvement I had was temporary. What if I can't keep up this momentum? I want to do well enough to get into a good high school, and I'm scared of disappointing my parents.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries, especially with the pressure to perform. Recognizing your achievements is important. Can you tell me more about what helped you during your study process that led to the improvement in your grades?

User: I think I started organizing my study time better. I made a schedule and stuck to it. That helped me feel like I was making progress. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Creating a schedule can really enhance focus and productivity. How did sticking to that schedule make you feel about your studies?

User: It made me feel more in control. But sometimes, I still get nervous before exams, thinking that what if I forget everything when the time comes.

Consultant: It sounds like the scheduling helped, but anxiety still creeps in at crucial moments. Let’s explore that thought a bit more. When you think about forgetting everything, what goes through your mind, and how does it affect you emotionally?

User: I guess I feel really panicky. I keep imagining the worst-case scenario where I fail, and it just takes over my mind.

Consultant: I see, so it creates a cycle of panic. Let’s challenge that thought together. When you consider the likelihood of that worst-case scenario actually happening, what evidence do you have that it might occur? 

User: Well, I did perform well in my mid-terms, so maybe I won’t mess up completely. But I just worry I’ll blank out.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but you also have evidence of your recent success to draw upon. If a friend felt that way before an exam, what would you tell them to help them see things differently?

User: I would probably tell them to trust themselves and focus on what they know instead of worrying about what they might forget.

Consultant: That’s very supportive advice! Now, let’s try applying it to yourself. Can you think of one or two strategies you could use to shift your focus from the “what ifs” to your knowledge and preparation during your next exam?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of what I studied and even visualize myself doing well during the exam. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Visualization can be a powerful tool. Beyond exams, what activities or thoughts can help reinforce your confidence in your abilities?

User: I enjoy studying in groups sometimes, and discussing topics with friends always gives me a different perspective. That helps me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Engaging with friends is a great way to solidify your knowledge and feel supported. How about setting up more study sessions like that as exams approach? 

User: Yes, I think I will. That sounds really helpful!

Consultant: Excellent! And remember to celebrate your accomplishments, too, no matter how small. How do you feel about recognizing those achievements as you prepare for high school?

User: I think it’ll help me stay positive. It’s easy to forget what I've achieved when I’m stressing out.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on your progress can maintain your motivation. Is there a way you could keep track of your achievements to remind yourself of your capabilities?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I note down what I completed each week or something.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! A journal can serve as a reassuring reminder of your hard work. How do you feel about embarking on this journaling journey to keep track of your progress?

User: I’m feeling excited about it! It’ll be nice to look back on what I’ve achieved.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we've talked about. You’ve recognized the value of your progress, created actionable strategies to face worries, and decided to try journaling. 

User: Yes, it feels good to have some practical steps to follow.

Consultant: I'm proud of you, Jiajia! Remember, you have the support of your family and friends, and you’re capable of achieving your goals. If similar feelings arise, you can always refer back to our session or your notes. This is not the end, but a new beginning. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident and ready to tackle my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you can always come back if you need more support. I believe in you, and I'm sure you will do great things in the future. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I appreciate the support from my family, especially my parents. It's comforting to know they believe in me as I prepare for high school.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling that support from your family. Having a strong sense of support can really help us tackle challenges. Can you tell me more about how their encouragement has impacted your studies and emotions?

User: Well, when they tell me I'm doing well and that they trust me to manage my studies, I feel more motivated. I don't get as anxious about my exams, and I can focus better when studying.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It sounds like their encouragement helps you feel more confident. What specific thoughts or feelings do you notice when you're studying, especially now that you're feeling more supported?

User: I feel more positive. I think about doing well and making them proud. I also remind myself that it's okay to ask for help if I need it.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have! Focusing on positivity and being open to asking for help can really enhance your learning experience. Have there been times recently where you've had to manage your emotions or stress while studying?

User: Yes, there have been a few stressful evenings when I had to prepare for quizzes. Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by everything, but I try to breathe and take short breaks.

Consultant: It's excellent that you're using breathing techniques and breaks to manage your stress. Those are effective strategies. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I tend to think that if I don't understand something right away, I won't do well on the exam. It makes me feel anxious and puts a lot of pressure on myself.

Consultant: I see. So, that thought of "not understanding means failure" can create a lot of pressure for you. Let's explore that a bit. How strong do you feel that thought is when you study? Is there another way to view it? 

User: I suppose I could see it as a learning opportunity instead of a failure. Everyone struggles with things from time to time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing challenges as opportunities for growth is much healthier. What might be a more balanced thought to replace the pressure-filled one when you feel overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could think, "It's okay to struggle; I can ask for help or take my time to learn." 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful thought! By reminding yourself that it's okay to seek help or take your time, you can reduce that pressure and approach your studies more positively. How do you think this new thought will change how you feel while studying?

User: I think I would feel less anxious and more willing to tackle difficult subjects since it wouldn't feel like such a big deal.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Feeling less anxious will certainly allow you to engage more fully with your studies. What can you do this week to practice this new way of thinking during your study sessions?

User: I want to remind myself about the opportunity to learn rather than stressing out. Maybe set small goals and check in with my parents for support if I struggle.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is an excellent approach! It helps in breaking down the larger tasks into manageable pieces. How do you feel about discussing your plans with your parents, so they can provide further support?

User: I think they would be excited to hear my plans. They always want to help me out!

Consultant: That's great to hear, Jiajia! Sharing your goals with them can strengthen that support network. Let's also discuss some strategies you can use to keep track of your emotional state as you study. What are some signs you might notice if you're starting to feel overwhelmed again?

User: If I start feeling really restless or can't concentrate, then that's a sign I'm getting stressed again. 

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing those early signs is a powerful tool. When you notice them, what steps can you take to reset your emotions and regain focus?

User: I could take a short break to breathe and maybe do something relaxing for a bit before returning to my studies.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Taking a break to do something you enjoy can definitely help reset your mind. How confident do you feel about applying these strategies next time you study?

User: I feel pretty confident. Knowing I can talk to my parents and take breaks makes me feel supported.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you have a solid plan for maintaining your emotional stability while studying. As we wrap up our session today, let's reflect on what you've learned and how you can apply it moving forward.

User: I've learned it's okay to struggle, and I can view challenges as opportunities. Plus, I should communicate with my parents about my study plans and feelings.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made significant progress in understanding your emotions and how to manage them effectively. Remember to keep practicing these thoughts and strategies. If you ever feel overwhelmed, your support system is there for you. I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel much better about managing my studies now. I appreciate our time together! 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jiajia! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you're capable of handling challenges, and I'm here to support you anytime you need it. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiajia! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling lately in terms of your studies and social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really great actually. I've started talking more with my classmates, and it makes me feel more confident. I also have a clearer plan for my future studies.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and that you've made progress in your interactions with your classmates. What specific changes have you noticed in your studies and relationships?

User: Well, I feel more comfortable participating in class discussions, which I used to avoid. My friends are more supportive, and I feel like I can share my thoughts without worrying as much about being judged.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It’s amazing that you’re able to engage in discussions and feel supported by your friends. How do you think this newfound confidence is affecting your academic performance?

User: I think it’s really helping! I’m more motivated to study, and I feel less anxious about exams. I can study for longer periods without getting as stressed as before.

Consultant: It sounds like you're on the right track with your motivation and ability to study effectively. Let's talk about how you feel when you're studying. Are there any strategies or routines you've found helpful?

User: Yes, I’ve started organizing my study schedule better and taking more breaks. I’ve also been using some study techniques my teachers suggested, which has made it easier for me to focus.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Organizing your study schedule and taking breaks can certainly help maintain your focus. How do you feel about your ability to stick to this schedule?

User: I think I can manage it pretty well. Sometimes I still struggle with distractions, but I remind myself of my goals, and that helps me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Reminding yourself of your goals can be a powerful motivator. When distractions arise, what do you usually do to bring your focus back to studying?

User: I usually take a short walk or listen to some music to clear my head. It seems to help me reset my mind.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! It’s important to have ways to reset your mind when distractions occur. Have you noticed any changes in how you handle stress compared to earlier?

User: Definitely! I’m less overwhelmed by stressful situations. Before, I would hide away when things got tough, but now I try to talk it out with someone or take a break.

Consultant: That's a really healthy shift in how you're approaching stress! Talking to someone or taking breaks instead of avoiding the situation can lead to better emotional health. Looking ahead, what are your goals for the next steps in your studies or social life?

User: I want to keep building my confidence, maybe join a club or team at school. I think that will help me make more friends and continue improving in my studies.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! It can definitely help you meet new people and further develop your skills. How do you feel about stepping into that next phase?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous too. I hope I can handle the extra responsibilities, but I think it will be worth it in the end.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both excited and nervous about new responsibilities. What do you think you can do to manage those nerves as you embark on this new endeavor?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Plus, I’ll have my friends to support me.

Consultant: That's an excellent perspective! Remembering that mistakes are part of growth is crucial. It’s great that you have the support of your friends as well. How can we ensure you continue feeling supported as you take these next steps?

User: I think regular check-ins would help. Just knowing I have someone to talk to if I need it makes me feel more secure.

Consultant: I can absolutely support you with regular check-ins. It’s important to have that support as you navigate these changes. Before we wrap up today, let’s quickly reflect on how far you’ve come. What do you see as your biggest achievement since our last session?

User: Definitely, my improved confidence and willingness to participate. It feels rewarding to see that I’ve changed.

Consultant: That is a remarkable achievement, Jiajia! Your hard work is clearly paying off. As we conclude our session today, remember the strategies you've developed and the support you have. If challenges arise in the future, you know you can reach out anytime.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I’ll definitely keep in touch.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your next steps in the future. Goodbye for now!
