Consultant: Hello, A Jing! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really low. I can’t shake off this feeling of being inadequate. It feels like I’m constantly comparing myself to others and coming up short. It's been really hard to get motivated in school.

Consultant: It sounds like that constant comparison is weighing heavily on you. You mentioned feeling inadequate—can you share more about what specific thoughts or situations trigger these feelings for you?

User: Well, seeing my classmates do so well and participate in everything makes me feel like I’m not good enough. Sometimes, I think about how I even considered taking a break from school because of how overwhelmed and unworthy I feel.

Consultant: That sounds very tough, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. You mentioned thinking of taking a break—what do you think would have happened if you had left school?

User: I thought it might relieve some pressure, but deep down, I know I want to be here. I just wish I could feel better about myself and my abilities.

Consultant: It’s a strong insight that you want to be here despite the pressure. Can we explore together what makes you feel pressured or inadequate when you’re in school? 

User: I feel like everyone expects me to excel, and when I don’t, I just think they must be disappointed in me. It’s exhausting to keep up that image.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel exhausted with that burden of expectation. Sometimes we can be our own harshest critics. Can you recall a specific moment in the past where you felt you did overcome a challenge, even if it was small?

User: There was a time during a group project where I contributed a lot and my teammates appreciated my work. It felt good, but now I just keep doubting myself despite that moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement, and it’s okay to celebrate those moments. How do you think those positive experiences could help you challenge the negative thoughts you're having now?

User: I guess they remind me that I can do well, but it just seems so far away right now. It’s hard to connect my past successes to how I feel today.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're finding it difficult to link those experiences because your emotions right now are clouding your perspective. What do you think would happen if you tried to remind yourself of that success when you're feeling low?

User: I think it could help, but it feels like I have to fight against this ongoing wave of negativity. It’s tiring.

Consultant: It’s definitely tiring to fight those negative thoughts. What if we create a small plan together where you can jot down some of these positive experiences, like the group project you mentioned? This way, when you’re feeling down, you can refer back to them as reminders of your capabilities.

User: That might work. I could start a journal to keep track of those moments. I just need to remember to do it consistently.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Just remember, the goal isn’t about perfection but rather about recognizing those moments of positivity. What do you think might motivate you to maintain this journal?

User: I guess if I set a specific time each day to reflect, it could help. Maybe before bed?

Consultant: That’s a great plan, A Jing! Setting a specific time can make it easier to form a habit. Along with that, we can challenge some of those negative thoughts when they come up. How comfortable are you with the idea of questioning those thoughts when they arise?

User: I’d be willing to try. I just hope I don’t fall back into my old patterns of thinking.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember it’s all about progress, not perfection. Each time you challenge those negative thoughts, you’re taking a step towards building your self-confidence. How do you feel about that prospect?

User: It sounds hopeful. I want to believe that I can change my mindset.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re open to this change. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you encounter hurdles, we can talk through those together in our future sessions.

User: Thank you! That really helps to know we’ll work on this together.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you. Let's also check in about your feelings regarding social interactions with your roommates and classmates. Have you noticed any changes in that area lately?

User: Well, I’ve been avoiding them more. I feel like they wouldn’t understand how I’m feeling, so it’s easier to stay away.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re struggling. Yet, sometimes those connections can provide support. Do you think there could be a small step you could take to re-engage with them?

User: Maybe I could join them for breakfast or a study session. I think I would feel anxious, but it might help me to connect again.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. It might feel a bit awkward at first, but remember that it’s okay to feel that—most people experience some anxiety in social situations. What do you think would help you in those moments of anxiety?

User: Breathing exercises or reminding myself that it’s okay to be imperfect around others could help.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It’s all about making yourself comfortable. So, for our next session, let’s dig deeper into your experiences with socializing and how we can continue to challenge those negative thoughts. 

User: I’d like that. I want to work through this and feel better about myself and my interactions.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, A Jing! Remember, you are not alone in this. We’ve made a good plan today, and I’m excited to hear about your progress next time!

User: Thanks for your support. I’m feeling a bit motivated to start trying these strategies.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in you, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, take it one step at a time. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello Ajing! I'm really glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling uncertain about your self-worth and are experiencing some pressure related to your academic planning. Can we start by discussing what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really self-conscious about myself lately, especially with how little I've interacted with my roommates. I feel like everyone is judging me for not being more social. It makes me question my value and future plans.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure and self-doubt, especially given the context of your social interactions and academic expectations. Let’s explore that a bit. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about yourself in these social situations?

User: I keep thinking that I must be boring or unlikable since I’m not talking to people. I feel like if I do engage, they’ll just think negatively about me.

Consultant: That sounds quite overwhelming. Those thoughts sound harsh and can really affect how you feel about yourself. Let’s try to unpack those ideas. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you are boring or unlikable?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence; it’s just a feeling. It’s just that I see other people engaging easily and I feel like I don't fit in.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel out of place, especially in a new environment. Sometimes feelings can create a narrative that isn't entirely based on reality. If you didn't have this belief, how might you describe yourself in social settings?

User: If I didn't feel that way, I guess I could say I can be fun and interesting once people get to know me. I just have a hard time initiating that.

Consultant: That’s a positive recognition! You identified that you have qualities that can shine through once you connect with others. Let’s shift our focus—what small steps do you think you could take to start engaging more with people around you?

User: Maybe I could start by just saying hello to my roommates when I see them. That doesn't seem too daunting, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, that's a great first step! Saying hello is a simple yet significant way to break the ice. How do you feel about actually following through with that?

User: I feel nervous but also a bit excited by the idea. I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Feeling a mix of nerves and excitement is perfectly normal. Let’s also think about what you can do afterward. How might you celebrate this small achievement if you do say hello?

User: I could treat myself to something nice or maybe tell someone close to me about it, like a friend.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Celebrating small wins can really help build your confidence. So, what’s the next step you would like to take before our next session?

User: I’ll try to greet my roommates and maybe engage in small talks if I feel comfortable. I’ll also try to keep a positive note on how it feels after each interaction.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it next time. Additionally, let’s take a moment to reflect on what we discussed today. What do you feel is one thing you've learned about yourself through this conversation?

User: I learned that I have interesting things to share, and it’s okay to take small steps to connect with people.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! Acknowledging your own worth and potential is key. As we wrap up today, remember that building connections takes time, and you’re already making progress. Any final thoughts or questions before we end?

User: Just thank you for helping me see things in a more positive light. It’s refreshing to talk about my feelings.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Ajing! It’s important to have these discussions, and I admire your willingness to work on these challenges. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. I look forward to our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you, I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Aijing! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling anxious about socializing. I want to participate more in campus activities, but the fear of being judged keeps holding me back. It's frustrating because I've been trying my best.

Consultant: It sounds like you're motivated to engage more but feel paralyzed by the fear of judgment. That’s completely understandable. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific situations trigger these feelings for you?

User: I think when there are big gatherings, I just freeze. I worry that people will think I'm awkward or won't enjoy my company, which makes me avoid those situations.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Aijing. It’s tough to feel that way in larger groups when you're worried about how others perceive you. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts during those moments?

User: Yes, I often think things like "I’ll embarrass myself" or "No one will want to talk to me." It feels really heavy.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite negative and can definitely contribute to your anxiety. Let’s explore them. How much evidence do you think you have that those thoughts are true? Have you experienced moments where the outcome was different?

User: Well, there have been times when I did end up talking to someone, and it went okay. But I seem to forget those moments when I start to feel anxious again.

Consultant: It’s common to overlook positive experiences when overwhelmed by anxiety. Can we challenge one of those negative thoughts together? For instance, if you think "I’ll embarrass myself," how could we reframe that into a more balanced perspective?

User: Maybe I could think that "I might have a good conversation" instead? It's just hard to hold onto that thought when the anxiety hits.

Consultant: That's a great start! Focusing on the possibility of a positive experience can shift your mindset. We can practice some techniques to help you keep that thought in mind when anxious feelings arise. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before social events?

User: Not really. I haven't known what to do. I'm just overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let's explore a simple relaxation technique called deep breathing. It can help calm your body when those anxious moments start creeping in. Would you like to try it now together?

User: Sure, that sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to sit comfortably. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice, actually. I feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember that you can use this technique anytime you feel anxious. Now, let’s think about a small social activity you could try this week, something manageable that might help you gradually face your fears.

User: Maybe I could try talking to a classmate after a lecture? It doesn’t sound too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! It’s a manageable step forward. How do you feel about setting that as your goal for this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited to try. It feels achievable.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! Remember to note down how that interaction goes afterward, focusing on any positive aspects of the experience. It can reinforce your confidence. Would you like to set up a time to discuss how it went next time?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I’d like to share my experience.

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll be here to support you and celebrate your progress. Before we wrap up today’s session, what do you think you can take away from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized I can challenge my negative thoughts and try using breathing techniques. I feel like I have some tools now to help me.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re already on the right path, Aijing. I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. Looking forward to hearing about your experience next time!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more hopeful.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and don’t hesitate to practice those strategies. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, A-jing! Welcome back to our session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last talked about your social interactions?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. I've been trying to speak up more in class, and I've had some positive responses from my classmates, which feels encouraging.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re receiving positive feedback from your classmates. How did it feel for you to express your thoughts in class?

User: Honestly, it was a bit nerve-wracking at first. I still feel anxious, but once I started talking, it became easier. I think I just need to keep practicing.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous at first. Practicing is exactly what you need to build confidence. What specific thoughts were going through your mind before you spoke up in class?

User: I kept thinking they might judge me or that I wouldn’t articulate my thoughts well. But I pushed myself to just say something anyway.

Consultant: That’s an important step! Challenging those negative thoughts is crucial for overcoming anxiety. Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that your classmates might judge you unfavorably?

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have strong evidence. Most of them seem friendly, and they did respond positively. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like there’s room to reframe that thought about judgment. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to view the situation differently?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes, and what matters is sharing their perspective. That feedback is usually constructive rather than critical.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Remembering that others are often supportive can help reduce your anxiety. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to embrace this supportive environment more fully?

User: I think I could feel less pressure. Maybe I would express myself more freely without fearing judgment.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive mindset to cultivate. Based on that, let’s make a plan. How about trying to reflect on every class interaction you have, noting what went well and what you’d like to improve?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! Writing it down might help me see my progress more clearly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping a record can help reinforce your positive experiences and identify areas you want to work on. How will you remind yourself to do this after each class?

User: Maybe I can set a reminder on my phone for after class to prompt me to write it down.

Consultant: Great idea! Setting a reminder will keep you accountable. As you reflect, try to focus on the positive aspects first, like what you did well. Can you think of some specific moments where you felt proud of yourself recently?

User: I remember speaking up in a group discussion about a project. I shared my ideas, and a few classmates thanked me for my input afterward.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! Acknowledging those successes is vital for building confidence. Do you feel you’ve developed any new skills in expressing yourself during these discussions?

User: I think I’m getting better at organizing my thoughts before I speak. It helps me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a significant development! Organizing your thoughts can reduce anxiety. What other strategies might help you prepare for future class interactions?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say before class. Just run through my ideas in my head.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is an excellent strategy. It can make you feel more prepared and less anxious. Let's keep discussing how this practice makes you feel in our next session. 

User: Sure! I’ll definitely do that and reflect afterward.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences! As we wrap up today, let’s review the progress you’ve made. What do you believe is your biggest accomplishment since we started our sessions?

User: I think my biggest accomplishment is feeling more comfortable speaking up in class and receiving positive feedback. 

Consultant: That’s a huge accomplishment, A-jing! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but you’ve shown resilience in pushing through. How can you maintain this progress moving forward?

User: I’ll continue practicing and reflecting. I want to keep this momentum going!

Consultant: That’s a great plan! I believe in your ability to continue growing. If you ever find yourself feeling anxious again, remember the supportive mindset we've discussed. It’s been wonderful working with you today. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m excited to continue working on this.
###################
Consultant: Hello, A-jing! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better lately. I’ve been more open to social activities and even made some new friends at the club I joined. It’s been nice to experience the joy of connecting with others.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're finding joy in social interactions. Can you share more about what you enjoyed during the club activities?

User: I loved the teamwork and sharing ideas with others. It felt really fulfilling to contribute and see everyone having a good time together.

Consultant: It sounds like you found the collaboration and connection with others very rewarding. How did that experience make you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel more confident. I realized I can engage with others and contribute positively. I even received compliments from some peers, which was surprising.

Consultant: That's fantastic, A-jing! Receiving compliments can really boost our self-image. How do you think these recent experiences will affect your social interactions in the future?

User: I think I’ll be more willing to participate in activities and not hold myself back. I want to keep building this positive momentum.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! To further support this growth, let’s practice some role-playing today. We can simulate different social situations. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I could use some practice, especially with approaching new people.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with a scenario where you meet a group of new students. What would you say or do in that situation?

User: I guess I would introduce myself and ask them about their interests. Maybe I could mention what I like too to find common ground.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Finding common interests often sparks good conversations. Let's role-play this. I'll be a student, and you can start.

User: Okay! *clears throat* Hi there! I’m A-jing. What are you studying?

Consultant: Hi A-jing! I’m studying psychology. What about you? 

User: Oh, I’m in education! I really enjoy it. I’m especially interested in how people learn.

Consultant: That’s really interesting! It's important to understand different learning styles. What inspired you to choose that field?

User: I have always liked helping others, and I think education is a powerful way to do that. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful motivation! You clearly have a passion for making a difference. How does it feel to express your interests?

User: It feels good! I realize it makes me more relatable and opens up the conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Expressing your interests not only showcases who you are but also invites others to share as well. How did this practice make you feel?

User: I feel more confident already! The more I practice, the easier it feels.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing in a safe setting helps build your confidence. Let’s explore another scenario. How about discussing networking at a school event? 

User: Sure! I find those kinds of situations a bit daunting, but I’d like to practice.

Consultant: Understandable! Let’s dive in. I’ll be a faculty member. Ready to approach me?

User: Yes. *approaches* Hello! I’m A-jing, a first-year student. I wanted to introduce myself and express my interest in the education program.

Consultant: Nice to meet you, A-jing! It’s great to see students actively engaging. What specifically interests you in the education field?

User: I’m passionate about inclusive education and making learning accessible for everyone.

Consultant: That’s an admirable goal! Have you been involved in any projects or activities related to that?

User: Not yet, but I’d love to start something in that area. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re ready to take action! Embracing your interests can lead to opportunities. How are you feeling about approaching a faculty member now?

User: It feels less intimidating. I think I can do it if I prepare myself!

Consultant: That's the spirit! Preparation often eases anxiety. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on your progress. What have you learned about yourself through our role-playing?

User: I've learned that I can engage positively with others and that I really enjoy talking about my interests. It makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful revelation, A-jing! Confidence can greatly enhance your social interactions. Looking ahead, how will you continue building on this confidence?

User: I’ll keep practicing and remind myself of these positive experiences. I want to be more proactive in social situations.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Remember, each positive interaction reinforces your confidence. I’m proud of your progress, and I look forward to our next session to discuss your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped now. I really appreciate your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome, A-jing. Keep believing in yourself, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A-Jing! I'm so glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more confident lately, especially after organizing the class event. It went really well, and I received a lot of positive feedback.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you really stepped up and showcased your leadership skills. How does that make you feel about your abilities moving forward?

User: It feels great! I’ve realized that I do have strengths I wasn’t fully aware of before. It has motivated me to take on more responsibilities.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re recognizing your strengths. What specific areas do you feel most excited to explore further or take on new challenges?

User: I think I would like to become more involved in student activities and maybe even start planning more events. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Getting involved can not only help you build more confidence but also expand your social network. What kind of event do you have in mind?

User: I was thinking about organizing a study group or a workshop to help first-year students transition easier. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Helping others can reinforce your own skills and knowledge. With what you've learned so far, how do you think you’ll approach planning this event?

User: I want to focus on making it interactive and supportive, providing a space for students to share concerns and tips.

Consultant: That approach is very thoughtful! Creating an interactive environment can really foster connections among students. Have you thought about any particular challenges you might face in executing this plan?

User: I guess one challenge could be getting enough people to participate, especially since some people are shy about sharing their problems.

Consultant: That's understandable. It can be tough to get people to open up. How might you encourage participation and create a comfortable atmosphere for them?

User: Maybe I could offer some icebreaker activities at the beginning or provide snacks to make it feel more casual.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Icebreakers can help ease the tension, and snacks do create a welcoming environment. How do you feel about presenting this idea to your classmates?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous about their reactions. What if they don’t find it useful?

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way. Remember, you’re offering something you believe will help them. What’s one way you can frame your presentation to emphasize its benefits?

User: I could share my own experience of struggling and how a supportive environment made a difference for me. 

Consultant: Sharing personal experiences can certainly resonate with others. It shows vulnerability and relatability. What steps will you take to prepare for this presentation?

User: I plan to outline what I want to say and maybe even practice with friends beforehand for feedback.

Consultant: That’s a smart move! Practicing with friends can definitely help you feel more comfortable. What will you do if you feel any anxiety before or during the presentation?

User: I think I will take a few deep breaths and remind myself of the positive feedback I received from last time.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique, and recalling positive experiences can really help boost your confidence. How do you feel about our discussion today regarding your growth and future plans?

User: I feel really positive and motivated! It’s nice to have a plan and see where I can go from here.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress, and it's clear you have a bright path ahead. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I have the ability to lead and help others while also continuing to grow myself. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That insight is incredibly empowering. Remember, if you ever feel unsure or challenged, you can always revisit those strengths. How would you like to continue your growth from here?

User: I want to keep setting small goals and seeking out more opportunities to lead or support others.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Continue to reflect on your experiences as you move forward, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need guidance. I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! This session has really helped me feel more confident about the future.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth. Remember, it’s okay to seek help whenever you need. Wishing you the best in your endeavors! 

User: Thank you again. I’ll keep all of this in mind. 

Consultant: You’re doing great, A-Jing. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
