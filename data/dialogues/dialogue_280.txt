Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately with all the pressure from school?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious, especially with the recent exams. I feel like I'm under so much pressure to perform well, especially since my last test scores were lower than I expected.

Consultant: I understand how stressful that must feel. It's tough when there are high expectations, especially from parents. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about your upcoming exams?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, my parents will be disappointed in me. It feels like their hopes are resting on my shoulders, and that makes me really anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you carry a heavy burden of responsibility and fear of disappointing your parents. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "I must not disappoint my parents," how does that affect your feelings and actions?

User: It makes me feel really overwhelmed. Sometimes I can't focus at all because I keep worrying about the results. I dread sitting down to study, and then I end up procrastinating.

Consultant: Procrastination can sometimes be a way of coping with that overwhelming anxiety. What would it look like for you to study in a way that feels more manageable and less pressured? 

User: I guess I would like to feel a bit more relaxed while studying instead of being scared all the time. Maybe setting a small goal each day could help me feel better.

Consultant: Setting small, attainable goals is a great strategy! It can help break down the overwhelming feeling into manageable pieces. Can we talk about a specific goal you could set for your study sessions?

User: I think I could start with studying just one subject a day for an hour. If I could feel accomplished with that, it might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! An hour focused on one subject can help reduce anxiety while allowing you to feel a sense of achievement. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel a bit relieved. It seems doable compared to trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That sense of relief is important. As you start implementing this plan, how do you think your feelings about studying might change?

User: I hope I can feel more in control and maybe even enjoy studying a bit. It would be nice to not dread it so much.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective. Enjoying the process could definitely ease the pressure. Let's also consider how you cope with anxiety right before the exams. What strategies have you used so far when you feel that anxiety kicking in?

User: I usually just try to ignore it or distract myself, but that doesn't really work. 

Consultant: Ignoring feelings can often lead to them building up even more. How about we discuss some relaxation techniques you could use when you start feeling anxious about exams?

User: That would be great. I could really use some help with that.

Consultant: One simple technique is deep breathing. It can help calm your mind and body. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise now together?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? Inhale... hold... and exhale. How do you feel after that?

User: I do feel a little calmer. It's nice to focus on my breathing for a moment instead of my worries.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a useful anchor during stressful times. You can use that before your exams to help ground yourself. How comfortable do you feel trying it before studying or taking a test?

User: I think I could definitely try that. I like the idea of using it to calm down before I start studying.

Consultant: That's a positive step forward! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. What three actions can you take to better manage your study sessions and anxiety?

User: I will set a goal to study one hour each day for one subject, practice deep breathing before those study sessions, and remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Those are wonderful actions, Xiaoyue! You've shown a willingness to adapt and find strategies that work for you. How do you feel about your capacity to implement these changes?

User: I feel hopeful. Even though I'm still a bit nervous about my exams, I think I have some tools now to help me.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Remember, it's normal to feel a bit anxious. You’re doing a great job by seeking strategies and being open to change. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with your studies and exams coming up?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious. My recent exam scores have dropped, and I can't shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. I worry that my mother will be disappointed in me, and I just can't sleep well at night.

Consultant: I can imagine how tough that must be for you, especially with your mother's expectations. It sounds like this pressure is really weighing on you. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your recent scores?

User: I keep telling myself that if I don't do well, it means I’m not smart enough. It's like this voice inside my head just won’t stop! 

Consultant: That voice sounds very critical. Let’s try to explore it further. What emotions do you experience when you have this thought about not being smart enough?

User: I feel frustrated and sad, and sometimes I even feel hopeless. It feels like the more I study, the less confident I am.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. So, when you study hard but still feel hopeless, it sounds really discouraging. Have you noticed if there are specific situations that trigger these feelings of inadequacy?

User: Definitely. For instance, when I sit down to study, I often think about how I need to get everything perfect, and if something feels hard, I just want to give up.

Consultant: That sounds like a lot of pressure you're placing on yourself. It's common to feel overwhelmed by the need for perfection. If a friend were to express such thoughts of inadequacy, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that nobody is perfect and that it's fine to make mistakes. But when it's me, I find it hard to believe that.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate perspective. It seems like you recognize that making mistakes is part of learning, yet you struggle to apply that to yourself. Let's think about that thought of needing to be perfect. How much evidence do you have to support that you must perform flawlessly to be valued?

User: I guess not much. I know that my parents love me regardless of my grades, but I just feel the pressure to live up to their expectations.

Consultant: It’s important to remind yourself that your worth isn’t based solely on your academic performance. Can we perhaps work on some alternative thoughts that might feel more supportive? For instance, what if we try to focus on the learning process itself rather than just the results?

User: That sounds good. I suppose I can remind myself that as long as I'm trying my best, that counts for something.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your effort and growth is a great strategy. How about we create a manageable study plan that allows you to take breaks and feel accomplished, rather than just fixating on the outcome?

User: That would be helpful! I often lose track of time and end up cramming. I need to learn how to break things down better.

Consultant: Great! Let’s work on that together. We can break your study material into smaller chunks and set specific times for each session. This way, you can maintain a balance and prevent burnout. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense! I think that will help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Along with that plan, how do you think you can use positive affirmations to counter those negative thoughts we discussed earlier?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I'm doing my best and that it's okay to not have all the answers right away.

Consultant: Exactly! Those affirmations can really help shift your mindset. Keeping a journal to record your thoughts and progress could also be beneficial. Do you think you'd like to try that?

User: Yes! Writing things down might help me see how far I've come, which is reassuring.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As we move forward, let’s also talk about strategies for managing your anxiety during study sessions or when preparing for exams. How have you been coping when you start to feel anxious?

User: I usually just try to push through, but it often doesn't work, and I feel more anxious afterward.

Consultant: Pushing through can be tough on you. Instead of forcing yourself, we could incorporate some mindfulness techniques or short breaks to help alleviate that anxiety. Are you open to trying those?

User: Yes! I’ve heard about mindfulness but haven’t tried it yet.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be very grounding. We can start with simple breathing exercises during your study breaks. How about we practice one together now?

User: That sounds good! I’d love to try it out.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale for four. Let’s repeat that a few times. How do you feel after the exercise?

User: I feel a bit calmer. I think this could help me during my breaks.

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing that can really help you manage anxiety in those moments of stress. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. What are some goals you’d like to set for this upcoming week regarding your studies and emotional well-being?

User: I want to try my study plan and at least do one or two mindfulness exercises each day. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Xiaoyue! Focusing on that plan and practicing mindfulness will support your progress. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've taken away from our discussion?

User: I feel like I have some strategies that might really help me out. It's more comforting to remember that I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re definitely not alone, and I’m proud of you for being open to change. Remember that it's a journey, and each step you take matters. If you have any concerns before our next session, please don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyue. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad you’re here today. I remember you’ve been feeling anxious about your studies and have been working hard to improve. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply the strategies we discussed, and while I feel like I've made some progress, it's still pretty unstable. I feel anxious and sometimes even doubt myself when I don't achieve what I expect.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some ups and downs. It's completely normal given the pressure you’re under. Can you share more about what specifically has caused you to feel anxious recently?

User: Well, I had a recent monthly exam and my grades weren't what I hoped for. My mom has really high expectations for me, and I just feel the weight of that sometimes.

Consultant: That must be really challenging for you, feeling that pressure alongside your own goals. What did those grades make you think or feel about yourself?

User: I felt really disappointed in myself. I thought I was doing better, but then my results showed otherwise. It makes me wonder if I can actually meet my mom's expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like you're grappling with some negative thoughts about your abilities. Have you had any thoughts like "I'm not good enough" or "I will never improve"? 

User: Yes, definitely! I sometimes think that maybe I’m just not cut out for this or that I’m not working hard enough, even when I try my best.

Consultant: These thoughts can feel overwhelming. You've been trying so hard, and it's important to recognize that effort. Can we explore together how much evidence supports the idea that you're not good enough? 

User: Well, I do put in a lot of time studying. Sometimes I just get stuck and can't remember things, which really frustrates me.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re dedicating time! It’s normal to hit blocks in learning. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their worth and abilities?

User: I’d probably tell them that they are trying their best and that everyone has struggles. I guess I just don't follow my own advice.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective. It sounds like you have compassion for others but may not extend the same kindness to yourself. Would you be willing to challenge those negative thoughts by treating yourself like how you would treat a friend?

User: I think I could try that. It’s just hard to shake off those negative feelings.

Consultant: Understandably so. Let’s start with something small. What is one area in your studies where you feel you've made progress, even a little?

User: I think my math has improved a bit. I got a few more questions right on the last practice test.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement, Xiaoyue! Celebrating small victories like that can help shift your focus. How can you remind yourself of this progress during tougher times?

User: Maybe I could write down my successes or keep track of what I’ve learned each week. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Keeping a record can really help reinforce your progress. Let’s also talk about balancing study with activities you enjoy. What types of activities have you been doing recently?

User: I haven’t really done much outside of studying. I used to enjoy painting, but I haven’t had time for that lately.

Consultant: Engaging in hobbies, like painting, can provide a healthy break and boost your mood. How about setting aside a little time each week just for painting? 

User: I think that could help. I’d really like to incorporate that back into my routine.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's set a small goal for this week for your painting time. How about starting with just 30 minutes?

User: That sounds doable! I’ll try to start with 30 minutes a few times this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaoyue! Balancing study with things you love can help ease your anxiety. As we explore this, what do you anticipate might be difficult, and how could you overcome that?

User: I might feel guilty about not studying during that time. But I guess I could remind myself that taking breaks can help me study better overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaks are essential. It’s fantastic that you recognize the need for balance. How will you reward yourself after this week of painting and studying?

User: I could treat myself to some ice cream or something I enjoy after a few sessions of painting!

Consultant: That sounds like a delightful reward! Focusing on your growth while enjoying some ice cream is a wonderful way to reinforce those positive changes. What emotions are you feeling about trying this new approach?

User: I feel a bit relieved to think about having fun while studying. I hope it works.

Consultant: That relief is a good sign! A positive approach can make a significant difference. What would you say is the most important takeaway from today’s session for you?

User: I think it’s that it’s okay to take breaks and that I need to be kinder to myself. It feels like I have a bit more control over my emotions.

Consultant: That’s powerful insight, Xiaoyue. Remember, being kind to yourself and recognizing your achievements are essential for your well-being. As we wrap up today, I want you to feel optimistic about the steps you can take.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my anxiety and making time for my interests.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made great strides today. Remember, balance is key. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it, too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yue! I'm really glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, I think. I started to focus on the extracurricular activities more, which has been fun. But I still feel anxious about my studies, especially with the recent drop in my exam scores.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you've found some joy in the extracurricular activities. Balancing those with your studies can be tricky. What specifically about your studies has been causing you anxiety lately?

User: I guess it's the pressure from my mom to do well. She has really high expectations for me, and I always feel like I need to meet them. It makes me nervous when I don't.

Consultant: That sounds tough, especially when the expectations feel overwhelming. How do you think this pressure affects your ability to study or focus?

User: I find it hard to sit down and actually start studying. I feel so much pressure that I just want to avoid it. Sometimes I just end up scrolling through my phone instead.

Consultant: I understand your feelings about wanting to avoid the stress of studying. What do you think would happen if you were a bit kinder to yourself when the pressure starts to feel really high?

User: I think I would probably feel more relaxed and maybe even want to study more. But it just feels difficult to change that mindset.

Consultant: It sounds like a shift in mindset could really help you find more enjoyment in your studies. What strategies do you think we could explore to tackle that pressure together?

User: Maybe I could set smaller goals for myself instead of just focusing on the final exam scores? That way I wouldn't get so overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting smaller goals can break down that pressure and make studying feel more manageable. Can you think of a few small goals that would feel realistic for you?

User: I could aim to study a subject for just 30 minutes a day and then take a break. Also, I might reward myself by participating in some fun activities afterward.

Consultant: I love that plan! Balancing study time with rewards sounds like a great way to motivate yourself. What activities do you enjoy that could serve as those rewards?

User: I really enjoy drawing and hanging out with my friends. Maybe after I study, I could spend some time doing one of those things.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful rewards! Engaging in activities you love can help relieve stress. How do you think you can incorporate those rewarding moments into your weekly schedule?

User: I guess I could plan something fun with friends on the weekends and set aside like half an hour each evening for drawing after I study.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Xiao Yue! Balancing study and leisure can provide you with a sense of control over your schedule. How do you feel about this new approach?

User: I feel much better about it! I think having the drawing time to look forward to will definitely help me stay on track.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you're feeling a bit more hopeful. Let's talk about the anxiety you mentioned before—has your relationship with it begun to shift at all now that you have some plans in place?

User: Yes, I think it has. I feel less anxious knowing I have a way to cope with the pressure, especially since I’m making time for things I enjoy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Remember to remind yourself of these positive changes, especially when you feel anxiety creeping back in. What’s one thing you can say to yourself during those tough moments?

User: I can tell myself that it’s okay to take breaks and enjoy life, and that my worth isn’t just based on my grades.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Xiao Yue. Acknowledging your worth beyond your grades is really important. How do you feel about your ability to utilize this affirmation moving forward?

User: I feel confident about it! I think I’ll definitely remind myself of that whenever I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Awesome! Just keep practicing that self-compassion as you move forward. As we wrap up our session, what are some key takeaways you’re leaving with today?

User: I’m leaving with a plan to set smaller study goals and to reward myself, which feels more balanced. I also feel more hopeful about tackling my anxiety.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiao Yue! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. If you ever need to revisit these strategies or share new feelings, I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and guidance today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I’m really glad to see you again today. I remember that we talked about your recent experiences with anxiety related to your studies and how involved you are with the art club. Can you share how you’ve been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I actually feel a bit more relaxed. Participating in the art club has been fun, and it helps me take my mind off the stress of studying. But I still sometimes worry about my grades because I know my mom is expecting a lot from me.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re finding joy in the art club! Balancing your passion with academic pressures can be challenging. Can you tell me more about how those feelings of pressure show up for you while you’re studying or when you’re creating art?

User: When I'm studying, I sometimes feel overwhelmed and can't concentrate. I think about how my mom will react if my grades aren't good, which adds to my anxiety. But when I'm in art practice, I forget about all that for a while.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with two different experiences—one that feels heavy with expectations, and another that allows you to express yourself freely. Let’s explore that pressure for a moment. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you feel overwhelmed by studying?

User: I often think, "If I don’t get good grades, my mom will be disappointed." And sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough, like everyone else is doing better than me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough and very common. Those thoughts can create a loop of anxiety. How do these thoughts impact your feelings and actions when it comes to studying or participating in other activities?

User: When I think I’m not good enough, I feel anxious and then I just want to avoid studying altogether. But during art practice, I feel much more confident and inspired. 

Consultant: It’s interesting how you feel more confident in your art. Let’s try to challenge that "not good enough" thought you mentioned. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief about yourself when it comes to your studies?

User: I guess I have always done well in school before, and I still participate in class and help others. But when I don’t do great on tests, it’s like all that good stuff disappears from my mind.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It seems like there’s a conflict between your past achievements and how you view your current situation. If a friend came to you feeling the way you do about their grades, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that one test doesn’t define their worth and that they have other strengths too.

Consultant: Exactly! You already know that one test doesn’t define you. Let’s try to apply that same logic to yourself. What if you reminded yourself of your strengths and past successes when you feel anxious about your grades?

User: That could help. I think I need to remind myself of my art and the support I get from friends. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Focusing on your strengths and support system can really help shift your mindset. Now, can we brainstorm some ways to incorporate reminders of your strengths into your study routine? 

User: Maybe I could create a visual board with my achievements and art, so I see it every time I study.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Visual reminders can be very powerful. How do you think setting up this board might influence your study sessions or your mindset toward your grades?

User: I think it would help me feel more positive and less anxious when studying. I could remember that I’m capable of more than just my grades.

Consultant: Exactly! Maintaining that perspective is key. As we talk about balancing studying and your passion for art, have you thought about scheduling dedicated times for both, ensuring you’re giving importance to both aspects of your life?

User: I haven't really planned it out yet. I mainly focus on studying, but I would like to find time for art too.

Consultant: Creating a schedule sounds like a productive step! How about you create a weekly plan that includes both study sessions and art practice? This can help ensure you're giving yourself time for things that bring you joy as well.

User: That makes sense! I think if I put it in my planner, it would help me stick to it and avoid feeling guilty about taking breaks.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Taking breaks for things you enjoy can actually enhance your studying efficiency. Now, as we prepare to wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies we've discussed and your progress in these areas?

User: I feel more confident about approaching my studies with a new mindset. The visual board and scheduling time for art seem like good ideas.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re making great progress. Remember, it’s about balance, and allowing yourself to enjoy the things that inspire you is just as important as studying. How do you plan to implement these strategies this week?

User: I’ll start by making the visual board this weekend and create a study schedule that includes art practice. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we close today’s session, I encourage you to keep reflecting on both your academic achievements and your growth in art. If you encounter any challenges, you can always remind yourself of your strengths. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I feel more at ease.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyue! I’m glad you’re feeling more at ease. Remember, you’re capable of navigating both challenges and joys in your life. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyue! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've made some progress since our last session. Can you tell me how you're feeling today?

User: Hi! I feel much better actually. I’ve been balancing my studies and my art activities, and it has helped me feel more energized and focused.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve found a good mix of activities that work for you. How do you feel about your studies now compared to before?

User: I still find some subjects challenging, but not as overwhelming as I did before. When I spend time on art, I feel more motivated to study later.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really support your motivation. Have your recent art experiences had any impact on your study habits?

User: Yes! I’ve noticed that I can sit down and concentrate better after I work on my art. It sort of refreshes my mind.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s great that you’ve found a strategy that helps your focus. Are there any areas of your studies where you still feel pressure, or is it mainly about the subjects that don’t come easily to you?

User: I think it’s mainly my parents’ expectations. They really want me to do well, especially my mom. I sometimes worry about disappointing them, which adds pressure.

Consultant: I hear you. Parental expectations can be tough to manage. It's good that you're aware of how it affects you. How do you cope with that pressure when studying?

User: I try to remind myself that I’m doing my best. I also talk to my friends, and sometimes they help me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: It’s great that you reach out to friends for support. Social connections can really lighten the load. What strategies do you think could help you cope better with your parents’ expectations?

User: Maybe I should communicate more with them about how I feel. I haven't done that because I didn't want to upset them.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable approach. Open communication can help them understand your perspective. Would you consider having a conversation with them about your feelings regarding their expectations?

User: Yes, I think I could try to talk to my mom about it. Maybe I can explain how I feel when I study under pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive plan. It's important they know how you're experiencing this. Would you like to brainstorm ways to frame this conversation so you feel comfortable?

User: Sure! I could start by sharing my recent improvements and how I appreciate their support but also express my need for a bit more understanding.

Consultant: That's a great starting point! Focusing on your successes first can set a positive tone. How do you feel about setting some personal academic goals too, aside from their expectations?

User: I’d really like that. It would feel good to have my own targets that are more achievable without feeling so stressed.

Consultant: Absolutely! What kind of personal goals do you think would be beneficial for you right now?

User: Maybe setting aside more specific time for study sessions and for art. I could also aim to improve in the subjects I struggle with gradually.

Consultant: Those sound like realistic and balanced goals. Balancing both study and leisure will help maintain your energy levels. How will you track your progress towards these goals?

User: I could use a planner to schedule my study and art time. I think keeping track will help me stay accountable.

Consultant: A planner is a great idea! It not only keeps you organized but also lets you visually see your achievements. How are you feeling about the balance you’re creating in your life right now?

User: I feel more in control. I think I’m learning to prioritize better, and it lowers my anxiety about studying.

Consultant: That's an excellent realization! Prioritizing can really transform your approach to both studies and personal interests. As we wrap up today, what strategies are you most excited to implement moving forward?

User: I'm excited to communicate with my mom and start using my planner. I think these will help me feel more balanced.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. If ever you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again. It’s been great to see your progress, and I believe you will continue to thrive.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more optimistic about everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyue! Keep nurturing that positive mindset. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: I will! Thank you, see you next time!
