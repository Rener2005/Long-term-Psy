Consultant: Hello, Yuan Yuan! I'm glad you're here today. I know things have been tough for you lately, especially with the pressure from school. Can we start by discussing how you've been feeling about your studies and your responsibilities?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious and feeling overwhelmed. As the math class representative, I feel this huge pressure to perform well. My recent math exam didn't go as I expected, and it's really making me second guess myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're under a lot of stress, especially with the expectations on you. When you say you feel overwhelmed, can you tell me more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you're studying or when you think about your responsibilities?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is counting on me to do well, and if I don't, I'll let them down. It feels like all eyes are on me. 

Consultant: That must be really heavy to carry, feeling like so much depends on your performance. Let's explore that a bit. When you think about disappointing others, what emotions come up for you?

User: I feel anxious and it's like this knot in my stomach. Sometimes I even think about how I wish I could just disappear because of the pressure. 

Consultant: I can see how that pressure is really impacting you. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you feel like everyone is watching you. Can we delve into what you believe might happen if you don’t meet those expectations? What do you imagine that would look like?

User: I guess I worry that my parents will be disappointed in me, and that my friends might think I'm not good enough. I have this fear of being judged.

Consultant: It's tough to feel like you could be judged by people you care about. It's a common fear. Would you say that this fear influences how you study or approach your responsibilities in school?

User: Yes, definitely! Sometimes I struggle to focus because I'm so scared of failing. I just freeze up and don't know where to start. 

Consultant: That’s a very common response to fear. When we're anxious, our mind can feel cloudy, which makes it hard to concentrate. What if we tried to challenge some of those thoughts? You mentioned about letting others down; is there any evidence that they would react negatively towards you?

User: Well, I don’t know for sure. My parents have always been supportive, and I think my friends would be understanding too. But I can’t shake off that feeling.

Consultant: It's great that you have supportive people around you. Let’s consider if there could be a different way to perceive the situation. If a friend of yours felt the same pressure and fear, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay not to be perfect and that everyone struggles sometimes.

Consultant: That’s really wise advice, Yuan Yuan. It sounds like you’re already recognizing that it's okay to be human and have challenges. What if you tried to speak to yourself like you would to a friend when you start feeling that pressure? 

User: I think that could help. I should remind myself that it’s okay to not always succeed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Promoting positive self-talk can really change how you face challenges. In addition to that, could we look into some practical strategies for managing your time and setting achievable goals? This might help you feel more in control.

User: Yes, I would really like that. I often feel lost when trying to organize my study time.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with your study schedule. How about we break your tasks down into smaller, manageable chunks? Can you think of one subject you want to work on this week?

User: I think I should focus on math, especially since I feel so behind.

Consultant: That makes sense. Let’s set specific goals for your math study this week. How much time can you dedicate each day to studying math?

User: I could probably study for about an hour after school each day.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, think about what specific topics you want to cover in that hour. Breaking your study into focused topics can help. What will be the first one?

User: I want to start by reviewing the equations we learned in class. 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! As you plan your study time, it might also help to incorporate short breaks. Taking a five-minute break every 25 minutes can actually increase your focus. How does that sound?

User: I think that could work for me. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let's also introduce some relaxation techniques to help when you feel anxiety creeping in. Have you tried any breathing exercises before?

User: I’ve heard of them, but I don’t really know how to do them.

Consultant: No problem! Let me guide you through a simple technique. When you feel anxious, try breathing in slowly through your nose for a count of four, holding it for four counts, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for four counts. 

User: That sounds easy enough. I think I could remember to do that!

Consultant: Wonderful! Practicing that can really help calm your mind when the pressure builds. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I've realized that it's okay to ask for help and that I can manage my studies better if I set smaller goals.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, you have the support around you. If you keep practicing those positive self-dialogues and the breathing techniques, you’ll find it easier to handle pressure. 

User: Thank you! I feel hopeful about making progress now. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Yuan Yuan! Remember, this is a journey, and you're taking steps in the right direction. If you need to talk again, I'm here for you. 

User: I will, thank you so much!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Yuan Yuan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've still been feeling really anxious about English. The upcoming test is making me a bit panicky. My legs shake and my heart races just thinking about it.

Consultant: It sounds like the anticipation of the test is really overwhelming for you. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about the English test?

User: I keep thinking that I won't do well, and that the teacher will be disappointed in me again. It’s like I’m afraid of being criticized.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like the fear of criticism is quite strong for you. How does that fear affect your ability to prepare for the test?

User: When I think about studying, I feel frozen and can’t concentrate at all. I just want to avoid it.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common response when we feel anxious. Let’s try to identify any specific negative thoughts that appear when you’re facing this fear. What goes through your mind during those moments?

User: I think that I’m just not good enough at English, and that I’ll embarrass myself again. 

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry. Let’s challenge this idea together. What evidence do you have that supports this belief of not being good enough at English?

User: Well, I failed the last quiz, and the teacher said she was disappointed. 

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd focus on that experience. But can you think of any moments when you felt successful in English, even if they were small?

User: I guess I understood a part of the lesson last week, and I was able to answer a question. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! Those small victories are significant. What if we focused more on those positive moments rather than the negative ones as we prepare for the test? How does that idea feel to you?

User: I think that could help. It just feels hard to stay positive.

Consultant: It can be challenging, but with practice, it can become easier. How about we create a little plan together? We could start with some small steps to make English feel less daunting.

User: That sounds okay. What kind of steps?

Consultant: We could start by looking at one simple English exercise a day. For example, read a short paragraph and summarize it in your own words. How does that sound?

User: That seems manageable. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! And remember, it's not about getting it perfect. It's about building that confidence little by little. If you find it too hard, we can adjust the plan. What do you think?

User: I like that. Knowing I can adjust makes me feel a bit better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you engage with these exercises, notice any thoughts that come up, especially negative ones. Write them down, and we can discuss them together in our next session. 

User: Okay, I can do that. I usually don’t think about the thoughts themselves.

Consultant: That awareness can help you understand your feelings more clearly. Now, let’s also think about what you can do to reward yourself after you complete these small tasks. What might that look like?

User: Maybe I can give myself a break to watch my favorite show after studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Treating yourself can reinforce the positive experience. So, do you feel more empowered to start this plan for English?

User: Yes, I feel like I have a small roadmap now.

Consultant: Excellent! I'm proud of you for taking this step. Remember, it’s okay to still have some anxiety; what matters is how you handle it. Keep practicing those positive thoughts, and we’ll explore them more in our next session. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it and feel a bit lighter already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Keep up the great work, and remember to be kind to yourself. I’ll see you next time!

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Yuan Yuan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my English learning. Joining the English corner made me feel more in control, but I still have some doubts.

Consultant: That's a great step forward! It's important to recognize the progress you’ve made. What aspects of participating in the English corner did you enjoy the most?

User: I liked that everyone was so supportive, and I found it easier to speak in front of classmates. But sometimes, when the teacher is around, I still get really nervous.

Consultant: It sounds like the supportive environment helped you feel more comfortable, which is wonderful. But the nerves around authority figures, like your teacher, are understandable. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you feel nervous around your teacher?

User: I keep thinking that I'll mess up or that they’ll be disappointed in me, just like before when my English teacher scolded me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It’s common to worry about disappointing others, especially if you’ve faced criticism before. How does thinking that way make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really anxious, and sometimes I just want to avoid speaking at all.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Yuan Yuan. It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety and avoidance. Let's explore ways to challenge those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that your teacher would be disappointed in you this time?

User: Well, I don't really have any proof. The teacher has been nice recently... it’s just a fear I can’t shake off.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have fears, especially when past experiences linger. If a friend were feeling this way about speaking in front of a teacher, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is there to learn, not to judge.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. What if you tried to apply that same mindset to yourself? How might this shift in thinking affect your feelings when you speak in front of your teacher?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that making mistakes is part of learning, and that my teacher is there to help me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing the idea that mistakes are a part of growth can really help reduce some of that anxiety. Let’s also think about what proactive steps you can take to build confidence in your interactions with your teacher. What do you think you could start doing?

User: Maybe I could try to ask questions more often or participate in discussions, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging more in class can help you gradually build your confidence. What do you think might help you prepare for those moments when you feel nervous?

User: I could practice some phrases or questions I want to ask ahead of time. 

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing in advance can empower you to feel more prepared. Let’s set a small goal for this week—perhaps participate in one discussion where you share your thoughts or ask a question. What do you think?

User: That sounds doable! I’ll try to participate more in the next class.

Consultant: That's excellent, Yuan Yuan! Remember, each small step you take counts as progress. After that class, we can discuss how it went. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel excited but still a little nervous. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel both excited and nervous! Embracing those feelings means you’re challenging yourself. Let's also plan to celebrate your efforts, regardless of the outcome. What would be a good way to reward yourself afterwards?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some ice cream or watch a movie I like.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice reward! Celebrating your efforts will help reinforce the positive changes you’re making. Let's talk about how you're adjusting in the English corner. With your growing comfort, are there any roles you’d like to take on during the sessions?

User: I think I’d like to try leading a small group discussion sometime. That seems challenging, but I want to give it a try.

Consultant: Leading a discussion is a great goal! It shows a lot of initiative. What steps could you take to prepare yourself for that? 

User: I could maybe prepare some topics to discuss and practice how I would lead the conversation.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Preparing in advance can alleviate some of the pressure. How can we together ensure you feel supported as you take on this new role?

User: Maybe we could come up with some strategies for leading, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Next session, we can work on some specific strategies and techniques for leading a discussion. Remember, building confidence is a process, and you’re making wonderful strides. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more motivated and definitely less alone in this. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open and willing to take these steps. Before we finish today, what will you take away from this session?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that I can learn from mistakes and that I’m getting better at English. I’ll definitely try to participate in class and prepare for leading the discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you have the ability to grow and succeed. See you soon!

User: See you! Thank you for everything!

Consultant: Hello, Yuanyuan! I'm glad you've joined me for this session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus on my studies, but I still feel a bit anxious, especially when it comes to interacting with teachers. I’ve been doing better with my friends, though.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your relationships with your friends are improving! That support can really make a difference. Can you tell me more about the anxiety you feel when interacting with teachers?

User: Whenever I'm in class, I feel really nervous, especially when I have to speak up. I worry about saying something wrong or disappointing them.

Consultant: It sounds like that pressure is quite overwhelming. What thoughts go through your mind in those moments that make you feel anxious?

User: I often think that everyone will judge me if I make a mistake, and I feel like I can't breathe sometimes.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense. Let's explore them a bit. Do you think there’s any evidence to support the idea that everyone will judge you if you make a mistake?

User: I don't know. Maybe it's just my assumption? But I remember when I spoke in front of the class last time, and some classmates giggled, which made me feel really embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough experience. It's understandable that it would stick with you. However, do you think that your classmates' reactions are a reflection of their overall opinion of you? 

User: Maybe not entirely, but it felt like they were laughing at me.

Consultant: It’s normal to interpret reactions in a way that relates to our feelings. However, can we consider the possibility that they might have been laughing at something unrelated? What would you say to a friend feeling the same way?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that they shouldn’t focus too much on what others think.

Consultant: That's a very kind perspective! Let's try using that same mindset for yourself. What if you could view mistakes as opportunities to learn instead of something to fear?

User: That does sound better. I guess I could try to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and it's part of learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! Learning to reframe your thoughts is powerful. Now, let’s talk about ways we can practice facing authority figures, like teachers, in a safe environment. Would you feel comfortable role-playing a situation where you ask a teacher a question?

User: I think I’d be okay with that. It might help to practice.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you have a question about a homework assignment. How would you start that conversation with your teacher?

User: I would probably say, "Excuse me, I have a question about our homework."

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! It’s clear and polite. What do you think might happen next?

User: I guess the teacher would respond, and I would feel anxious about their reaction.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a common feeling. But remember, you have practiced this. How will you remind yourself to stay calm during the response?

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath before I speak. That might help me focus.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Deep breaths can help ground you in those moments. Let's think about a real situation you could practice in. Do you have any school events or opportunities coming up where you can interact with teachers?

User: Yes, there’s a parent-teacher meeting next week, and I could potentially speak to my teachers there.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful opportunity! It might be a supportive environment, and you already have that connection with your friends. How do you feel about using this situation to practice what we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also kind of excited. I want to try it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Yuanyuan! Feeling nervous is completely normal, but your excitement shows you're ready to take this step. Let’s talk about support—perhaps you can bring a friend along for encouragement.

User: Yes, I could definitely ask one of my friends to come with me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a friend can make the experience feel more comfortable. What’s your plan for the conversation at the meeting?

User: I might ask my teacher for tips on improving in English since I struggle with that.

Consultant: That’s a great topic to bring up! It shows your interest and willingness to improve. How can you remind yourself to be confident when you approach the teacher?

User: I think I’ll tell myself it’s okay to ask for help and that teachers want to support us.

Consultant: Exactly! Seeing teachers as allies can really shift your viewpoint. When you think about this meeting, how do you want to feel afterward?

User: I want to feel like I did well and that I actually spoke up for myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! After our session today, let’s plan for you to reflect on your experience during the meeting and how you handled the interactions. It’s important to acknowledge your progress.

User: Yes, I’ll definitely keep track of how it goes!

Consultant: Perfect! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've learned and what steps you plan to take. How do you feel you’ve progressed since we started our conversations?

User: I feel more confident about speaking with teachers and more prepared to manage my fears.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for recognizing that growth, Yuanyuan. Now you have strategies to cope with anxiety and create a supportive environment for yourself. Would you like to discuss how to maintain this confidence moving forward?

User: Yes, I’d like to have a plan for that!

Consultant: Great! As we prepare to finish, remember that feeling confident can take practice. Reinforcing the positive experiences and continuing to work with your friends can help you maintain this mindset. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel good. I’m excited to see how this week goes!

Consultant: That's exciting to hear! I'm confident that you’ll do wonderfully. Remember, I'm here if you need guidance in the future. You have the skills to manage this and more. Thank you for sharing today, Yuanyuan, and I wish you lots of success at the meeting!

Consultant: Hello, Yuyuan! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling surprisingly good. I managed to end the semester on a high note, and I even received a motivational award from school!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Congratulations on your award! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. How do you feel about your achievements?

User: I feel really proud of myself. It’s nice to see some of my hard work recognized.

Consultant: That pride is important! Let’s take a moment to reflect on everything you did to earn that award. What specific actions or changes do you think contributed to your success?

User: I definitely studied more consistently than before, and I tried to ask questions when I didn’t understand something. I felt more confident speaking up in class.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! By studying consistently and engaging more in class, you’ve built a strong foundation for your learning. How has this increased confidence impacted your feelings about the upcoming school year?

User: I feel more excited than nervous about starting again. I really hope to keep up this momentum.

Consultant: That enthusiasm is fantastic! It’s great to hear you’re feeling excited. What steps do you think you could take to maintain this positive mindset as you move into the new year?

User: I think setting small, achievable goals for myself might help. Like maybe aiming to improve my grades in certain subjects.

Consultant: Setting those small goals sounds like a smart plan. Considering your recent achievements, it could boost your self-efficacy. What specific subjects are you hoping to focus on?

User: I want to work on my math skills because I’ve always found it a bit challenging compared to other subjects.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! It’s important to identify areas for growth. How can you structure your study time to tackle math more effectively?

User: I think I could dedicate specific days for math practice, maybe work through problems a bit every day instead of cramming.

Consultant: That sounds very effective, Yuyuan! Gradual practice can definitely help strengthen your math skills. How would you feel if you encountered challenges along the way? 

User: I guess I would feel frustrated, but I’m willing to work through it. I have to remind myself that it’s okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: It’s absolutely okay to feel that way, and acknowledging those feelings is a great step forward. What strategies could you use to cope with frustration if it arises?

User: Maybe I could take short breaks or talk to someone if I’m feeling stuck. It might help to express what I’m going through.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking breaks and reaching out can indeed relieve stress. How do you currently feel about sharing your struggles with others?

User: I feel a bit hesitant, but I know that opening up could help. I just worry about burdening my friends.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but true friends usually want to support each other. How might you approach this with your friends to make it feel more comfortable?

User: I could share my feelings when we’re just hanging out casually, not making it a big deal. Just mention it if the topic comes up.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Making it casual may ease the pressure. Remember, true friendships involve sharing both struggles and successes. How do you think this openness could influence your relationships?

User: It might strengthen them. If I share more, I think my friends would understand me better, and maybe they’d feel comfortable sharing too.

Consultant: Exactly! Building that trust can create a supportive environment. As we move towards the end of our session, is there anything specific you feel you’d like to take away from today’s conversation?

User: I’d like to keep reminding myself of my accomplishments and build a real plan to tackle my goals.

Consultant: That’s a solid takeaway! Recognizing your achievements and having a clear action plan can really empower you moving forward. How about we summarize some of your goals today?

User: Sure! I want to focus on math by studying regularly, set small goals, and keep sharing my feelings with friends.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals for the new year! I'm confident that with this mindset and plan, you will continue to thrive. Remember, I’m here for support whenever you might need. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel ready for the new challenges! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yuyuan! Keep up the fantastic work, and remember to celebrate your progress. See you next time!
