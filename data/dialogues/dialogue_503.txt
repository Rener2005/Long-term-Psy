Consultant: Hello, Z! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been anxious, especially with how people might judge my stuttering. I feel like it's getting worse, and I don’t know what to do. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Z. It’s understandable to feel anxious about how others perceive you. Can you share more about what specifically worries you when you think about interacting with your classmates? 

User: I keep worrying that they will laugh at me or think I'm not smart because of my stuttering. It makes me want to avoid talking to them altogether. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're really worried about negative judgments from your classmates. Let's explore that a bit. What thoughts go through your mind right before you interact with them? 

User: I often think, "What if I embarrass myself?" or "They'll see me as different." It's hard to shake those thoughts off. 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite distressing. It’s also possible that they are adding to your stuttering anxiety. Can we reflect on the evidence for those thoughts? Is there any proof that your classmates would react negatively? 

User: Not really. I guess they haven’t actually laughed at me, but I just feel it’s what they’re thinking. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially since anxiety can distort our perceptions. Have there been any moments when your classmates have acted supportive or friendly toward you? 

User: Yes, there have been a few times when they were nice, but I just couldn’t focus on that in those moments. 

Consultant: Recognizing those supportive moments can be a helpful start. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts. What would you say to a friend if they were worried about being judged like you? 

User: I’d probably tell them that most people are understanding and may not notice their speech at all. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you’ve identified a more compassionate perspective. What if you tried to apply that same understanding to yourself? 

User: It makes sense—maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on myself. 

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Let’s also talk about some coping strategies you can use before engaging in social interactions. What do you think about practicing some relaxation techniques? 

User: I think that could help. I usually just get overwhelmed and freeze up. 

Consultant: One technique we can try is deep breathing. It can help calm your nerves. Would you like to practice a quick deep breathing exercise together? 

User: Sure, I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4... and hold it for four... 1, 2, 3, 4... now gently breathe out for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you? 

User: I felt a bit calmer after that. I think I could use this before class. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this can help create a sense of control before engaging in conversations. Remember, it’s okay to take a moment for yourself. 

User: I'll definitely try to remember that. It feels good to have a plan. 

Consultant: Yes, having a plan is empowering! Let’s also think about a small step you can take this week to practice speaking, maybe with a close friend or family member? 

User: I could try talking to my roommate about a topic we both like. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Just remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect. Focus more on the conversation and less on how you’re speaking. 

User: I'll try to keep that in mind. I really hope it goes well. 

Consultant: We'll take it one step at a time. If you start feeling anxious, remember to use the breathing technique we practiced, and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. 

User: Yeah, I think I can do that. It helps to have your support. 

Consultant: I’m here for you, Z. Let’s recap what we’ve achieved today. You’ve started to identify your negative thoughts and learned some techniques to begin reducing anxiety. How do you feel about your progress? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to see things a little differently. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep practicing those skills and remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. For our next session, we can continue working on your experiences and the progress you make with your conversations. 

User: I’m looking forward to it! Thank you for your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Z! Remember, you’re making positive strides. I believe in your ability to handle this. See you next time! 

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Z! I'm glad to see you again. Last time we talked about your classroom experiences and how your stutter has affected your confidence. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty anxious again, especially after that incident in class where I stumbled over my words. It makes me reluctant to speak up.

Consultant: I can sense that you're feeling a bit defeated and anxious after that experience. It’s completely normal to feel that way. Can you tell me more about what you thought during that moment when you stumbled?

User: I kept thinking everyone was laughing at me. I really felt embarrassed and wished I could just disappear. After that, I didn’t want to raise my hand anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience had a significant impact on you. You mentioned feeling embarrassed and thinking that others were laughing. It seems like those thoughts really amplified your anxiety. How do you think those thoughts affected your feelings during class?

User: I think they made me even more nervous. I ended up focusing too much on what I might say wrong instead of just speaking.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Z. It seems like the focus on potential mistakes is creating a cycle of anxiety. Let's explore that further. When you think, "Everyone is laughing at me," can you identify any other thoughts that come to mind?

User: Sometimes I think that maybe I shouldn’t even try to speak at all if I’m just going to embarrass myself. 

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to contend with. It’s understandable that you would want to avoid feeling embarrassed. But let’s consider this—if a friend were in your position, what would you say to them? Would you advise them to hold back from speaking?

User: I would probably encourage them to speak up and not worry too much about what others think. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would want to support your friend. Now let’s see if we can apply that same support to you. What if we challenged the thought of “I shouldn’t try to speak”? What evidence do we have that speaking up can lead to embarrassment every time?

User: Well, I know there were times where I spoke up and nothing bad happened. Like when I answered a question correctly a while ago.

Consultant: That's a great reminder! Clearly, not every speaking opportunity ends badly. Let’s focus on those positive experiences. How about we practice some techniques that you can use in class to build your confidence? Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would like to try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! One effective technique is to practice speaking slowly. This can help ease your anxiety and make it easier for you to articulate your thoughts. Would you feel comfortable giving it a shot with me right now? 

User: Sure! I’ll try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple sentence. Try saying, “I enjoy learning new things” but do it slowly, pausing between each word. 

User: I… enjoy… learning… new… things.

Consultant: That was excellent, Z! You did a fantastic job at pacing yourself. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt okay. It was different to speak that way, but I felt a little less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! The more you practice this, the more natural it will become. How about we create a plan for when you’re in class? For example, before answering a question, you can remind yourself to take a deep breath and speak slowly. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful. I think I can try that next time.

Consultant: I believe you can do it! Also, let’s think about how you can encourage yourself on days when you feel nervous about speaking up. What’s one way you can remind yourself to be confident next time?

User: Maybe I could write a little reminder on my desk or in my notebook?

Consultant: That's a great idea! A visual reminder can be very effective. You could even write something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes.” How do you feel about using that reminder?

User: I like that idea, it feels reassuring.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As you continue to practice these techniques, it will help build your confidence. Is there another area in your life or any other situation where you feel similar anxiety about speaking or expressing yourself?

User: Yes, I often feel anxious in group settings, like when I try to make new friends.

Consultant: That’s another important area to explore. Social interactions can be tricky. What thoughts do you have when you’re in those situations?

User: I usually worry that I won’t know what to say or that I will mess up like I do in class.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those worries, but just like in class, it’s crucial to challenge those thoughts. What if we considered the possibility that you can also make strong connections with peers, even if it doesn’t always go perfectly?

User: That could be true. I guess not every conversation needs to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! Making new friends can involve missteps, and that’s perfectly normal. What’s one small step you can take to engage in those social situations, like initiating a conversation?

User: Maybe I could try asking someone about their favorite classes or hobbies?

Consultant: That's a fantastic start! Engaging in light conversation can help ease your anxiety. How about setting a small goal for yourself to try this out in the next week?

User: I will definitely try to talk to someone about their hobbies. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Remember that every conversation is an opportunity to learn about others and yourself. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what we’ve worked on. What do you feel are your biggest takeaways from our session today?

User: I feel like I can speak slower and that I’ll try to remind myself it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Those are significant takeaways, Z! I’m proud of you for your willingness to try these new strategies. Before we conclude, is there anything you’d like to discuss or address before our next session?

User: No, I think I’m okay for now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember to practice your speaking techniques and take those small steps towards engaging with others. I'm here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, Z!

Consultant: Hello, Z! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit down. I tried to join some conversations in the dorm, but I ended up stuttering and felt left out. I just want to avoid any more embarrassment.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Z. It sounds like you're feeling disappointed and helpless in social situations. It's understandable to want to avoid those feelings. Can you tell me more about what happened during those conversations?

User: Well, I tried to jump in when my classmates were talking, but every time I opened my mouth, I just couldn't get the words out properly. They interrupted me, and I felt like I didn't belong.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Being interrupted can be discouraging, especially when you’re already feeling insecure. It’s normal to worry about acceptance among peers, but let’s explore this together. What emotions did you feel after being interrupted?

User: I felt embarrassed and sad. I just wanted to connect with them, but instead, I just sat back and let them continue talking.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel sad after trying to connect and feeling rejected. Have you noticed any thoughts that run through your mind when you think about these social interactions?

User: I often think that they will laugh at me for my stuttering. I worry that they will see me as awkward and not want to be friends.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Let’s look at this together—how much evidence do you have that your classmates would laugh at you or see you as awkward? Is it possible they might not judge you as harshly as you think?

User: I guess I don't really know. Maybe they wouldn’t react that way, but I still feel scared.

Consultant: Fear can often cloud our judgment. When you think of a friend experiencing the same situation, what would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay and that everyone has little quirks. But when it’s me, I just feel so nervous.

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective, Z. It seems like you can recognize that it’s okay to have quirks. Let's take a moment to challenge that fear. What if we set a small goal for you to try expressing yourself in a safe way? 

User: I'm not sure. It sounds scary, but I know I need to try.

Consultant: How about this: what if you aimed to contribute just one sentence during your next dorm activity? It doesn’t have to be perfect; just a simple statement. How does that sound?

User: That sounds a bit less intimidating, I guess. I can try.

Consultant: Great! And if you feel comfortable, let’s brainstorm some simple sentences you might like to use. We could role-play these interactions, so you’ll feel more prepared when the moment arises. 

User: Okay, that could help me practice. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s try a role-play now. Imagine we’re in your dorm, and there’s a discussion about a recent movie. What might you say to join in?

User: Um, maybe I could say, “I really liked the ending of that movie!”

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! Let’s practice saying it together. Remember, it’s about expressing yourself, not about being perfect.

User: (Nervously) I really liked the ending of that movie!

Consultant: That was great, Z! See how simple it can be? Each time you practice, it becomes a little easier. 

User: Yes, I can see that. I still feel nervous, but I think I can try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Acknowledging your feelings is a big part of this process. Let’s plan for the next time you have a chance to speak up. How do you feel about that?

User: I think I’m willing to give it a shot next time. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Remember, facing these situations gradually can help lessen the anxiety you feel about them. We can also discuss coping strategies to manage those feelings if they come up.

User: I’d like that. I need some ways to calm myself down when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing techniques or grounding exercises can help. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, that sounds nice.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat that a few times. How does that feel?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed doing this.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Z! You now have a strategy to use whenever you feel those anxious thoughts creeping in. Would you like to discuss how to keep this momentum going in the future?

User: Yes! I want to continue working on being more confident.

Consultant: Great! Let’s summarize what we've talked about today. You’re ready to try contributing in social settings, you’ve practiced some sentences, and you have a relaxation technique to use when anxiety hits. 

User: Yes, that makes sense. I feel a little more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, every little step counts, and you’re not alone in this journey. How about we set a time for our next session to check on your progress?

User: I’d like that. I want to keep up with this.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need more support in the meantime. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate this.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Z! You've taken some significant steps today. I'm confident in your ability to navigate your social environment. Have a great day!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Z! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a little better, actually. The support from my teacher during class made me feel more encouraged. But I still find it hard to engage with my classmates.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt supported by your teacher! That’s a positive step. Can you tell me more about what you felt when your teacher gave you that support?

User: I felt happy and relieved, like someone actually noticed me. But then I started worrying again about speaking in front of others.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel both happy and anxious. You are beginning to notice the positive moments, which is an important step. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about speaking in front of others?

User: I keep thinking that I will mess up my words and everyone will laugh at me. It makes me want to avoid talking altogether.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s clear that those thoughts make you anxious. Let’s challenge those thoughts a little. Do you think there's any chance that your classmates are more understanding than you assume?

User: Maybe... I guess some of them might be nice. But then I also remember a time when someone joked about my stuttering.

Consultant: That experience must have been hurtful for you. It’s understandable to feel scared after something like that. However, is it possible that most people would not react that way? What would you say to a friend who fears being teased for something similar?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much, that it's okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s very kind advice! Now, how can you apply that same understanding to your own situation? 

User: I guess I could try to be nicer to myself and not jump to conclusions that everyone will judge me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s really important to treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend. Let's think about some moments when you’ve interacted positively with others lately. Can you recall any recent social experiences, even small ones?

User: Last week, I helped a classmate with her homework. I felt good about that, but again, I didn’t talk much otherwise.

Consultant: Helping your classmate is a wonderful interaction! Recognizing that good moment can help increase your confidence. How did you feel after that interaction?

User: I felt proud of myself for helping, but the other interactions still make me anxious.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you felt proud. Let’s build on that! How about we develop a plan where you can record these positive experiences? You could note down any small interactions, like the one you had helping your classmate, and reflect on how they made you feel.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could also think about what went well each time.

Consultant: Yes! This is a great way to reinforce the positive feelings. Additionally, we can introduce some mindfulness techniques to help you feel more grounded when you’re in social situations. Would you be open to that?

User: Sure. I’m willing to try anything that could help me feel calmer.

Consultant: Fantastic! Simple techniques like deep breathing or focusing on the present moment can be very helpful. Let's practice a short breathing exercise together now. Would you like to try it?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. How does it feel?

User: It feels nice. I feel a bit more relaxed now.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Implementing this technique right before you engage in social situations can help calm your nerves. How do you feel about using this in your daily life?

User: I feel more confident using it in school now that I’ve tried it.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for being open to this! As you practice this, also remember to acknowledge each positive moment and interaction, no matter how small. This will help build your confidence even more.

User: I will try to remember that! I think I should be more aware of all the good interactions I have.

Consultant: Absolutely! Understanding and reinforcing those positives is key. And as we continue, it’s important to recognize that building confidence takes time. How do you envision the next steps for yourself?

User: I hope to talk to more classmates, maybe join a group or club where I can meet people.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Joining a group can provide more opportunities for interaction in a supportive setting. What kind of group or activity interests you the most?

User: I’m thinking about joining the art club since I love drawing.

Consultant: The art club could be a perfect fit for you! It’s a relaxed environment where you might be able to connect with others over shared interests. Would you be excited to explore this new opportunity?

User: Yes, definitely. It sounds fun and less pressure compared to just talking.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Embracing new opportunities can really help build connections. Let’s agree to check in about how that goes in our next session. 

User: Sounds good! I can’t wait to share my experiences.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing all about them. You’ve made some great strides today, Z! Remember, take things one step at a time, and be proud of every bit of progress. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful after talking.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Z! It's great to see you again. I'm excited to hear how your experiences have been since our last session, especially with the drama club. How have you been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really proud of myself for participating in the drama club. I managed to speak in front of others without panicking, which is a big step for me. But I still worry about my stuttering when I'm around people.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Z! It sounds like participating in the drama club has given you a significant boost in confidence. Can you tell me more about how you felt when you spoke in front of everyone?

User: I felt really excited and nervous at the same time. But once I got through my lines, the applause made me feel appreciated. It was nice to receive positive feedback from my peers. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Receiving applause and appreciation can be very uplifting, especially after facing a challenge. What do you think contributed to your ability to speak confidently in that moment?

User: I think it was mostly about being prepared and knowing my lines well. Also, everyone was really supportive, which helped me relax a bit. 

Consultant: It sounds like preparation and support from your peers played crucial roles. That’s a valuable lesson for future situations! Have you noticed any changes in how you approach social situations since participating in the drama club?

User: Definitely! I’ve started to feel a bit more open to talking to others. I even had a few conversations with classmates I normally wouldn’t approach. But I still feel anxious about my stuttering.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've taken steps to engage with classmates! That’s a significant progress. Let’s delve into that anxiety you feel about stuttering. Can you share more about when you notice this anxiety affecting you?

User: I usually feel anxious when I’m in a group or have to introduce myself. It’s like I freeze up and the words get stuck. I’m worried they’ll judge me or make fun of me.

Consultant: I understand that fear; it’s common to worry about being judged, especially in social settings. What thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel that anxiety in those moments?

User: I think things like, “What if I mess up?” or “They will think I’m weird.” Sometimes I even imagine them laughing at me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, where you imagine negative outcomes. What would it look like if you challenged those thoughts? For example, what evidence do you have that people would judge you harshly?

User: Well, I don’t really have any strong evidence... All my friends were supportive during the play. They actually complimented me afterwards, so maybe it's not so bad. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Your friends' support is a strong indicator that the reality might not be as frightening as your thoughts suggest. If a friend of yours felt the way you do, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that everyone has their own quirks, and it’s okay to be nervous. I would encourage them to just be themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to offer kindness and encouragement to others. Now, how can you turn that same kindness inward towards yourself? What might be a more supportive thought to replace those anxious ones?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's alright to be a little nervous. Everyone understands that people have different communication styles, and they won’t judge me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in perspective, Z. Practicing those supportive thoughts could help reduce your anxiety in social situations. What are some specific actions you could take next time you find yourself in a social setting?

User: I could practice my introductions beforehand and tell myself those supportive thoughts if I start to feel anxious. Perhaps I could even ask a friend to join me and help ease my nerves.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Having a friend with you and practicing beforehand will definitely strengthen your confidence. How does it feel to have those plans in place?

User: It feels reassuring! I feel like I have some control over my anxiety now. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Having a plan can be very empowering. Is there a specific social situation coming up where you could try out these strategies?

User: Yes! There’s a school event next week where I need to introduce myself to new students. I think it’s the perfect opportunity to practice.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity to put what you’ve learned into action! How do you feel about approaching this event now that you have a plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I really want to make new friends and show them my personality.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit nervous, but you have the skills to handle it. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and solidify your next steps. What do you feel are your biggest achievements from our sessions?

User: I’ve learned to recognize my negative thoughts and replace them with supportive ones. I’m also taking more steps to engage socially, which feels great!

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are significant achievements. As you move forward, embracing that newfound confidence is key. What will you focus on to maintain this growth in your social interactions?

User: I will make sure to practice my supportive thoughts and try to engage in more activities where I can meet people. I want to keep building my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Z. Just remember, you have the tools to navigate social situations, and it’s okay to take it step by step. If you ever need support again, you know where to find me. Take care until next time!

User: Thank you! I feel much better about everything. I really appreciate your guidance!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, I'm really glad to see you again! How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling much better lately. My confidence has improved a lot, especially after the project I worked on with my classmates. I was able to communicate effectively, and it made a big difference in how I feel about myself.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the project had a positive impact on your confidence and your relationships with your classmates. Can you tell me more about how you felt during that project?

User: Sure! I was nervous at first, but as we worked together, I felt more comfortable expressing my ideas. I actually enjoyed collaborating and realized that my contributions were valued. That made me feel more connected to my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a great experience working as a team! Building connections like that can be really important for your social development. What do you think contributed to making you feel more comfortable this time?

User: I think it was knowing that we all had a common goal. Plus, my classmates were really supportive, which helped me relax and focus on the project instead of worrying about my speech.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! Having supportive people around can make a huge difference. Given your progress, what would you like to focus on today to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I want to make sure I keep this confidence up, especially now that I'm thinking about how to be more social in the future. I don't want to slip back into feeling anxious or afraid to talk.

Consultant: Great goal! It's important to have plans to sustain your growth. What specific social situations do you think you may want to engage in moving forward?

User: I'm considering joining a club or participating in more group activities, maybe even a volunteer project. But I worry a bit about how to approach people in those settings.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Joining clubs or volunteer activities can give you lots of opportunities to meet new people. Let's explore how you can approach these situations. What worries you the most about initiating conversations?

User: I guess I'm just scared that I might stutter or they'll think I'm not good enough to talk to. I still have those fears creeping in sometimes.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Many people have similar concerns when meeting new people. Let's challenge that thinking. What evidence do you have that supports your ability to connect with others despite your stutter?

User: Well, I did communicate well during the project, and my classmates responded positively. They actually seemed to appreciate what I had to say.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve already proven that you can communicate effectively. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their ability to engage with others?

User: I would probably say that everyone has their own challenges, and it’s okay to be themselves. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s more important to try than to worry about being perfect.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective to hold! Now, how can we apply that mindset to your future social interactions? What action steps can you take to blend confidence with a willingness to engage?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to introduce myself to at least one new person at club meetings or events. That way, I can practice in smaller steps without overwhelming myself. 

Consultant: That sounds like a practical and manageable plan! Breaking it down into smaller steps will help ease anxiety. How do you feel about creating a checklist for these interactions to track your progress?

User: I like that idea! It would help to see my progress and remind me of my goals. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As you keep track of your experiences, it may also be helpful to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you plan to reward yourself for achieving those goals?

User: I think I’d treat myself to something I enjoy, like a movie night or a nice dessert after I make progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun and positive way to acknowledge your efforts! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to continue moving forward. 

User: I learned that I can leverage my past success in communication and that it's okay to be myself. Setting realistic goals and tracking my interactions can help me stay confident. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You’ve made so much progress, and I believe you have the tools to keep these positive changes going. If any challenges come up, remember that you can always reach out for support. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel much more confident about my social plans, and I appreciate your help in getting here.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your growth, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes. Remember, you’re capable of great things!

User: I will, thanks again! I’m excited to keep working on this.

Consultant: Take care, and I wish you all the best! Don't hesitate to come back if you need more support in the future.
