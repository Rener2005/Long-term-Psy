Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my past lately and it’s been pretty overwhelming. I still feel this heavy shame about the things I did when I was in the hospital. 

Consultant: I hear you. It's understandable to have those feelings about your past experiences. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you share what specific memories or thoughts have been weighing on you?

User: I keep remembering the times when I would just shut myself off from everyone. I feel so embarrassed about having those moments and not being able to reach out for help.

Consultant: It sounds like those memories are really painful for you. Feeling embarrassed can be quite heavy to carry. What do you think these memories say about how you view yourself now?

User: I think they make me feel like I'm still that person who needed help all the time, and that I’m not good enough to be around others.

Consultant: So, it seems like you're associating those past actions with a sense of unworthiness. Let’s try to clarify that. Is there anything positive happening in your life now that shows a different side of you?

User: I have been doing better in school and reconnecting with some friends. But I still hold onto the idea that I’m broken because of my past.

Consultant: That’s an important recognition. You are making progress and creating new experiences. Let’s talk about the idea of being "broken." What evidence do you have that supports that belief?

User: Well, when I think about my past, I can't help but feel that those experiences define who I am. I guess I just can’t seem to shake that off.

Consultant: It’s common to feel defined by past experiences, but I want to challenge that. If a friend were in your shoes, feeling the same way about their past, what might you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that they’re not defined by their mistakes; everyone has struggles and it doesn’t make them less deserving of happiness.

Consultant: Exactly! You would remind them of their worth irrespective of their past. Now, how can you apply that same compassion towards yourself?

User: I suppose I need to be kinder to myself. It just feels difficult sometimes to look past my past actions.

Consultant: Acknowledging that difficulty is also a part of self-compassion. Let's start with small steps. What’s one thing you could tell yourself when you have those feelings of shame about your past?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’m working hard to overcome it and that it’s okay to have made mistakes.

Consultant: That sounds like a great affirmation! Affirmations can help reframe those negative thoughts. How does saying that to yourself make you feel?

User: It actually feels a bit lighter. I think it’s a step towards not carrying this burden all the time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Lighter is a great sign. Let’s take it further. Is there a specific time in the day you can remind yourself of this affirmation?

User: I think in the mornings would be a good time, right before I start my classes.

Consultant: That's a perfect plan. Starting your day with a positive affirmation can set a nice tone for your day. Along with this, what activities or interactions can we incorporate that might encourage a sense of acceptance and connection?

User: Maybe I could reach out to my friends more often and join some campus events to meet new people.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging with others could help counter those feelings of shame. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about reaching out or participating?

User: I feel nervous about it, wondering if they’ll judge my past. But I also want to connect with them. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about that. Let’s examine this fear. What evidence do you have that they would judge you negatively?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. It’s just a fear based on my insecurities.

Consultant: That’s a key insight! Fears can often stem from insecurities rather than reality. How might you challenge that fear when you consider reaching out?

User: I could remind myself that my friends care about me and my past doesn’t have to dictate our friendship.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! As you navigate these feelings, remember to be gentle with yourself. Reflecting on the progress you've made is important. Shall we outline a few specific steps for you to take before our next session?

User: Sure! I’ll work on my morning affirmations, reach out to a friend, and try to attend one campus event this week.

Consultant: Those sound like constructive steps! I’m glad to hear you’re setting these intentions. How do you feel about all this as we wrap up today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, I guess. It’s still hard, but I think I’m beginning to see a way forward.

Consultant: Hope is a wonderful feeling to hold onto. Each step you take is progress. Before we finish, let's reflect on what you've learned about yourself today. How would you summarize your experience in our session?

User: I realized that my past doesn't have to define my worth, and that being kind to myself is really important.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Emphasizing self-kindness is an essential part of healing. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone in this. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the journey you’ve been on and to see how you’re feeling now. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve really been struggling with my self-acceptance. Sometimes I feel like I can’t shake off the shame from my past actions. It really weighs me down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden of shame related to your past experiences. This can be incredibly challenging. Can you tell me more about the feelings that come up when you think about your past?

User: Whenever I reflect on my previous behavior, I feel a deep sense of guilt. It’s like I can't forgive myself for what I've done, which makes it hard to move forward.

Consultant: I hear you. Holding onto guilt can certainly make it difficult to progress. What would it mean for you to forgive yourself or to let go of that weight?

User: I think it would allow me to feel more free, to focus on my present and really start living again, not just existing.

Consultant: That’s a powerful aspiration. It seems like freeing yourself from this guilt could open up new possibilities for your life. Let’s explore this further. What specific thoughts come to mind when you’re feeling guilty about your past?

User: I often think that I’ve disappointed everyone, including myself. I keep replaying those moments and judging myself harshly.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when we hold ourselves to high standards. Let’s examine those thoughts. How realistic do you think it is that you’ve disappointed everyone? 

User: I guess I tend to exaggerate the impact of my actions. Not everyone is as affected as I think they are. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Recognizing that not everyone sees your past the same way you do can be liberating. How do you think reframing that thought would change the way you feel?

User: I think it might help me feel less alone in this. It could lessen the weight of guilt, knowing that people can move on from mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! People often grow from their experiences. Now, let’s consider the idea of self-forgiveness. What would self-forgiveness look like for you?

User: It would mean acknowledging that I made mistakes but understanding that I’m not defined by them. I’d like to be able to treat myself with kindness instead of judgment.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful goal. Self-kindness can be a powerful tool for healing. What might be a first step you can take toward being kinder to yourself?

User: Maybe I could start by writing down my thoughts when I feel guilty and then counteracting them with positive affirmations about who I am now.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. Writing can be very cathartic, and countering negative thoughts helps in reshaping your narrative. How would you feel about sharing some of those affirmations with me next time?

User: I think that would be helpful! It would hold me accountable and also give me something to look forward to.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Now, while you’re working on that, what are some activities that help lift your mood and reinforce your sense of self-worth?

User: I enjoy playing music and spending time with friends. Those moments help me forget some of the darker thoughts.

Consultant: Those are wonderful outlets! Engaging with music and friends can remind us of the joy in life. How can we incorporate more of those activities into your routine to help counterbalance the guilt?

User: I could set aside specific times each week to get together with friends and play music. I think having that scheduled would help me stick to it.

Consultant: Scheduling those moments can certainly help reinforce their importance. Let’s aim for a gentle balance, where you still prioritize self-compassion while enjoying what you love. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect. I feel like I’m starting to see a way out of this shame spiral.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, this is a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. As we continue our sessions, we’ll keep building on this momentum. Do you have any lingering thoughts or feelings from today that you’d like to discuss?

User: I think I just want to make sure I’m not rushing this process. I know it takes time to heal.

Consultant: Absolutely! Healing is indeed a process, and it’s perfectly normal to take your time. I’m here to support you every step of the way. You’re making progress, and that’s what matters. 

User: Thank you for that reassurance. It really helps to know that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you’re not alone, and it’s okay to lean on others for support, including me. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on next week?

User: I think revisiting the idea of self-kindness and sharing those affirmations I write down would be really insightful for our next session.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect focus for our next session. I’m looking forward to hearing about your reflections and affirmations. Let’s continue to build on this foundation of self-acceptance. 

User: I appreciate that. This feels like a good beginning toward stability in how I see myself.

Consultant: I’m glad we’re on this journey together. Keep being kind to yourself, and I’ll see you next time with those affirmations! 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel okay, but then I suddenly get this overwhelming shame about my past. It's really affecting how I see myself and how I act in daily life.

Consultant: I can understand how those feelings of shame can create instability in your self-image. It’s important that you feel supported while we work through this. Could you tell me more about those moments when the shame creeps in? What thoughts go through your mind during those times?

User: Usually, I think about the mistakes I made and how I embarrassed myself. I feel like I shouldn't even be trying to get my life back on track. It makes me doubt everything I've accomplished since coming out of the hospital.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite intense and impactful for you. A pattern of thinking like this can be very difficult to navigate. Have you considered how these negative thoughts might be affecting your feelings and behaviors, especially when it comes to your confidence and interactions with others?

User: Yes, I sometimes avoid social situations because I fear being judged or that people will remember my past mistakes. It’s like I’m always on edge, worrying about what others think of me.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It seems like there's a connection between how you view your past and how it influences your present actions. Let’s try to identify some of those automatic thoughts when you feel shame. Can you recall a specific recent incident where you felt this way?

User: Well, just last week, I ran into an old friend. I felt this wave of shame about my past actions, and I ended up making excuses to leave the conversation. I realized afterward that I missed a chance to reconnect.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that experience. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind when you chose to leave the conversation? 

User: I thought that they would judge me for what I have been through. I kept thinking they would see me as flawed or broken.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy. Let’s challenge those beliefs a bit. What evidence do you have that your friend perceives you that way? Is it possible they may be more understanding than you think?

User: I guess I don’t really know what they were thinking. They could have been genuinely happy to see me, but I was too wrapped up in my own fears.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. Sometimes our fears can cloud our judgment about what others think of us. How do you think your perception of that situation might change if you focused on the possibility that your friend was supportive instead?

User: Maybe I would feel a lot less anxious about talking to people. I could remind myself that they are probably just happy to see me, not judging me.

Consultant: Exactly! By reframing your thoughts, you can start to relieve some of that pressure and shame. Have you found any helpful techniques to practice self-affirmation and build your self-esteem since we last spoke?

User: I’ve tried to list some things I like about myself each day. But it sometimes feels difficult to believe those positive traits when I feel so ashamed.

Consultant: That's a great start! It’s completely normal to struggle with self-affirmations, especially during challenging times. Let's explore how we can strengthen that practice. How about we create a list of characteristics and achievements that you're proud of? 

User: Sure, that sounds like a good idea. I think I'm good at being supportive of friends, and I really enjoy learning new things in class.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! Being supportive and dedicated to your studies shows resilience, and those are traits to celebrate. How can you remind yourself of these strengths when you feel shame creeping in?

User: I could put the list somewhere visible, I guess. Or even practice saying it to myself when I feel down. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Remember, it takes time and repetition to change those deep-seated beliefs. Over time, those affirmations will feel more believable. How do you feel about focusing on this strategy moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful. Having tangible reminders might help. But I still worry about those feelings of shame from the past resurfacing unexpectedly.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to have those concerns. Let’s work on developing coping strategies together for those moments. What would you like to do when those feelings resurface in the future?

User: Maybe I can talk to a friend about it or write in my journal. I think expressing it could help.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Writing can be a powerful way to process feelings, and leaning on a friend reflects your support system. Remember, it’s about gradually enhancing your ability to handle these emotions. 

User: Yes, I really want to build my resilience over time. I want to feel strong enough to face my past without it taking over my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a strong motivation! Each small step you take builds that strength. With practice, you will enhance your ability to face those thoughts and feelings. It’s a journey, and you won’t be alone in it. 

User: I appreciate that. I’m feeling more in control now, even if it’s just a little.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Your journey of rebuilding self-esteem is ongoing, and it's okay to have ups and downs. As we wrap up our session today, what key takeaway do you have that you’d like to focus on until we meet again?

User: I think I'll focus on reminding myself of my strengths and facing those shameful thoughts with more kindness.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! Remember, progress takes time, and being kind to yourself is essential. I'm proud of the steps you're taking. If you need any support along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here for you. Looking forward to our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to stay positive, especially with focusing on my studies. But sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed by everything that's happened in the past. It's tough.

Consultant: I completely understand. It’s great to hear that you’re making an effort to stay positive. Can you share with me some specific moments recently when you felt overwhelmed?

User: Sure. The other day, I was at a study group, and I felt really anxious. I kept thinking about how far I had fallen behind compared to others. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s normal to feel anxious in comparison situations. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "I will never catch up," and "Everyone else is doing better than me." Those thoughts just spiraled and made my anxiety worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to carry a lot of weight. How did they make you feel emotionally when you were thinking that way?

User: I felt quite defeated and frustrated. It made me want to withdraw from the group.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts could lead to feelings of defeat, especially in social settings like that. Let’s try and examine those thoughts for a moment. What evidence do you have that supports the thought that “you will never catch up”?

User: Well, I have fallen behind in a few classes, and I see my peers progressing faster. 

Consultant: Falling behind can feel discouraging. But is there any evidence that suggests you can’t catch up? What alternatives could there be?

User: I guess I have been making some progress, even if it’s slow. Maybe I just need to focus on my own pace instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier perspective. Focusing on your own progress could be a key to alleviating some of that pressure. If you were to give advice to a friend in a similar situation, what would you suggest they do?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone moves at their own pace and that they shouldn’t compare themselves to others.

Consultant: That’s wonderful advice! It’s often easier to extend kindness to others than to ourselves. Now, how can we apply that kindness to your own situation? What steps can we take to challenge those negative thoughts when they arise?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of my progress and try to set small goals instead of focusing on what others are doing.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach. Setting small, achievable goals can indeed help you build confidence. How about we plan some specific goals for your studies together?

User: Yes, I think that would help! I’d like to start with a weekly study plan.

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s identify a few subjects you want to focus on this week. What do you think is manageable for you right now?

User: I can handle two subjects this week. I’ll focus on the ones I find the most challenging.

Consultant: Excellent choice! By tackling the challenging subjects, you’ll also be building your confidence. After setting this plan, how will you check in with those feelings of anxiety?

User: Maybe I can take a few moments each day to assess how I’m feeling and reflect on my progress.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful strategy! Taking time to reflect can really help you stay grounded. How do you feel about reaching out to that study group for support if you begin to feel overwhelmed again?

User: I think I could do that. I’ll just need to remind myself that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking for support is a sign of strength. Let’s talk about how you might feel when you do reach out for help. 

User: I might feel scared at first, but I think it would be reassuring to know I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Feeling scared is normal, but recognizing that you're not alone can really shift the dynamic. How can you reinforce that feeling of support in your daily life?

User: I could plan regular catch-ups with friends or join more study sessions. It sounds like a good way to stay connected.

Consultant: Wonderful! Connecting with others through shared activities can significantly enhance your support system. How does this make you feel about your journey moving forward?

User: It feels a bit more hopeful now. I think I can manage my studies better and rely on my friends.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift in your mindset! Remember to celebrate those small victories along the way. As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to rely on others and take things at my own pace. I shouldn’t be too hard on myself.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Embracing your own pace and acknowledging your support network are essential steps. How are you feeling about our next session?

User: I’m looking forward to it! I want to keep building on this progress.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it as well! Remember, you're doing remarkable work by addressing these feelings. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the meantime. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you decided to come in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a little more positive, actually. Participating in that group activity with friends helped. But I worry that I might not sustain this feeling.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt positive about the group activity! It sounds like it had a good impact on you. Can you tell me more about why you think you might not be able to sustain this feeling?

User: I guess I’m just worried that I might revert to my old self and struggle to connect with people again. Those fears can make me hesitate to join new activities.

Consultant: It’s entirely normal to have those worries, especially after making progress. Let's explore those fears a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about joining new activities?

User: I often think that I’ll embarrass myself or that people won’t like me. Those thoughts really discourage me from putting myself out there.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts, but they can be quite limiting. Have you considered how valid those thoughts are in relation to your recent experiences with group activities?

User: Not really, I just assumed they are true because that's how I used to feel. I’m still learning to trust myself.

Consultant: It can take time to adjust your thinking patterns. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that people wouldn’t like you, especially considering your recent positive interactions?

User: I suppose I don’t have solid evidence. The group activity went well, and I felt accepted. Maybe I'm just fearing the worst without actual reason.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization! It sounds like your fears might be exaggerating the situation. How might you reframe those negative thoughts about new social situations?

User: Maybe I could think of it as an opportunity to meet new people instead of something to fear. That might make it less daunting.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on the opportunities can help shift your mindset. What’s one small step you could take to put this new perspective into action?

User: I think I could try attending a new club at the university next week. It sounds interesting, and I might meet some new friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Attending that club could be a fantastic way to expand your social circle while focusing on something you enjoy. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It's a mix of feelings, I guess. I really want to try it.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel a mix of emotions when trying something new. We can prepare a bit for that nervousness. What strategies can we brainstorm that might help you manage those feelings when you're at the club?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's about meeting new people, not just impressing anyone. I could also bring a friend along for support.

Consultant: Bringing a friend for support sounds like an excellent idea! It can help alleviate some of that anxiety. Additionally, reminding yourself to focus on meeting people rather than impressing them is a valuable perspective. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds reassuring. I think I can manage that!

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s all about gradual exposure to help you grow more comfortable. After the club, we can discuss how it went and what you learned. What are your hopes for that experience?

User: I hope to make at least one new connection, even if it’s just a casual conversation. That would be a positive outcome.

Consultant: That’s a very achievable and positive goal! Remember, every small connection counts. How can you acknowledge and celebrate those small victories?

User: I could keep a journal to note down any positive interactions I have, no matter how tiny. It would help remind me of my progress.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent strategy! It allows you to reflect on your experiences and appreciate your growth. What other activities can you engage in to build on this progress in your social life?

User: I’d like to try more group outings—maybe joining a study group or attending social events. 

Consultant: That’s a great way to actively engage with others! Each new experience will help reinforce your social skills and confidence. Remember, progress is about consistency and taking small steps. 

User: I guess I just need to keep pushing myself a little. It’s comforting to have these strategies.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about building a foundation of confidence and resilience. Let’s plan to meet again after your club visit to reflect on your experiences. Does that work for you?

User: Yes, that sounds great! I feel more encouraged to take the plunge now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small, because it truly matters. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Me too! I’ll see you next time! 

Consultant: Take care, and best of luck with your new adventure! See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing quite well overall. I feel like I'm more in control of my emotions lately. But sometimes, I still have moments of uncertainty about my future. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’ve been feeling more in control. Feeling uncertain about the future is completely normal, especially during a period of transition. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing this uncertainty for you?

User: I guess it’s mostly about my studies and whether I’ll be able to cope with the pressure. I want to do well, but there are days when I doubt myself.

Consultant: I understand that pressure can be a significant source of stress, especially with your academic goals. Let’s explore those doubts a bit more. What specific thoughts or worries go through your mind on those days?

User: Sometimes, I think about whether I’m really cut out for my program. I compare myself to my peers, and it’s hard not to feel inadequate.

Consultant: It sounds like comparing yourself to your peers is adding to your feelings of doubt. Can you identify any particular thoughts you tell yourself when you feel inadequate?

User: I often think, “I’ll never be as good as them.” It makes me feel like I’m falling behind, which really affects my motivation.

Consultant: That thought seems quite harsh and negative. Have you noticed how this thought makes you feel in those moments?

User: Yeah, it makes me feel anxious and demotivated. It’s like a cycle—I feel bad about my performance, which makes me want to avoid studying.

Consultant: That’s a tough cycle to be in. Let’s question that thought. What evidence do you have that you won’t be successful in your program compared to your peers?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s more of a feeling I have when I’m overwhelmed. 

Consultant: It's understandable that feelings of overwhelm can heighten your sense of inadequacy. If you were to approach this differently, what might you tell a friend who was experiencing the same doubts?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own pace and that they shouldn't compare themselves so harshly to others. 

Consultant: That’s very insightful! It seems that you recognize that comparison isn’t helpful. How might you apply that advice to your own situation moving forward?

User: I think I could try to focus more on my progress rather than how I measure up to others. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift! Focusing on your own journey can help alleviate some of that pressure. Could we design a few small steps for you to practice this approach?

User: Sure! Maybe I could keep a journal of my achievements, no matter how small. It might help to see my own growth.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your achievements is a powerful way to reinforce your self-esteem. How often do you think you could write in your journal?

User: I could try to write in it a few times a week. Maybe after each class or study session?

Consultant: That sounds manageable! It will help you create a habit of self-reflection. Is there anything else that you think could support you during this process?

User: I think talking about my feelings more openly with friends could help. They’ve been supportive before.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings can foster good connections and allow you to feel less isolated. Would you like to set a goal for reaching out to them this week?

User: Yes, I’ll try to initiate a conversation with a close friend this week about how I’ve been feeling. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It will help you feel supported as you navigate your emotions. How do you feel about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel optimistic. Having a plan makes me feel more in control and less anxious about my future.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. If you ever need to revisit these strategies or talk about anything new, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate the support. It’s comforting to know that I can talk about these feelings openly.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you're making. Let's continue to work together on these strategies. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.

User: Take care, and see you next time!
