Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session, Xiao Mo. Before we dive in, I’d love to hear how you've been feeling lately and if there have been any specific events on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been really anxious and upset. Things at home have been messy ever since my mom started moving us. I just don't know how to cope with all these feelings, and I keep acting out in class.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and discomfort due to the changes in your home. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in school, especially those moments when you felt the urge to act out?

User: Well, during class, I keep interrupting and moving around a lot. I just can't stay still, and it seems like my classmates don’t like me much because of it. There was this time in gym class when I missed a shot and got mad at my friend. I didn’t mean to, but I just lost it.

Consultant: It seems like your emotions are really intense right now, especially when it comes to school and your friends. I appreciate you sharing that. What were you thinking at that moment when you got angry at your friend?

User: I don’t know, I just felt embarrassed because everyone was watching. I thought everyone would think I'm a failure. Then I took it out on him, which was really unfair. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you felt ashamed and that triggered a strong reaction. It’s okay to feel embarrassed, but let’s explore those thoughts together. What did you tell yourself in that moment about missing the shot?

User: I thought that if I missed, I must be terrible at basketball and everyone would judge me. It felt like the worst thing ever.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry. It's important to acknowledge those feelings. Sometimes, our minds can exaggerate situations. If a friend were in your shoes, how do you think you would respond to him about missing a shot?

User: I guess I’d tell him it’s okay and that it happens to everyone. It’s just a game after all.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a kinder perspective to have. It might be helpful to remind yourself of that when things go wrong. What do you think about trying to replace the harsh thoughts with that kinder thinking?

User: It sounds like it could help a little. I just feel so overwhelmed sometimes, especially when I think about home.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with all the changes at home. Can you share how you think the changes at home might be affecting your feelings at school?

User: Well, my parents are always fighting, and now with my mom moving, it just feels like everything is falling apart. I’m worried about what’s going to happen next.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Mo. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainties. Let's think about how you can express these feelings instead of acting out. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that. I want to learn how to handle my emotions better.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. One way to start is by recognizing when you're feeling a strong emotion. Can you think of a way to catch yourself when you're starting to feel angry or upset?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths? I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Yes, deep breathing is an excellent strategy! It can help calm your mind and body. How about we practice that together now? 

User: Okay, let’s try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times. 

(They practice deep breathing together.)

User: That feels nice. I feel a bit calmer now.

Consultant: Good job, Xiao Mo! This technique can be very useful when you start to notice those intense feelings. We can also explore other strategies, like expressing your feelings. Did you ever think about talking to your mom about how you feel?

User: I haven’t really because I’m afraid she’s too stressed. But I think I should.

Consultant: Absolutely! Speaking to her could be a great step. It might even help her understand your feelings better. What might you say to her?

User: I could tell her that I feel sad and confused about everything happening at home. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Being honest about your emotions can lead to better understanding. How would you feel about trying this after our session?

User: I think I can do it. I really want to improve things at home and at school.

Consultant: Fantastic, Xiao Mo! You're making progress already. Lastly, let’s recap what you’ve learned today. You practiced deep breathing, recognized your feelings, and thought about expressing them to your mom. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels good. I feel like I have some tools to help me now.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for help when you need it. You’ve done great work today. Our sessions will continue to build on this. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?

User: Just that I’m feeling a little more hopeful now. I’m glad I talked to you.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Mo! You're not alone in this journey. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little Mo! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really frustrated. At school, I'm having trouble with my music class. I can’t control my feelings, and I keep disrupting the class and even talking back to the teacher.

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through a tough time, especially in music class. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel so frustrated during those moments?

User: I don't know... It just feels like everything is too much. Sometimes I get really anxious because of my mom's job. She’s always busy, and my dad isn't around much either. It all makes me upset, and then I just snap.

Consultant: That's a lot for a young person to handle. It sounds like your mom's work situation and your dad being away are adding to your stress. When you feel that anger bubbling up, what thoughts are usually going through your mind?

User: I feel like nobody cares about me. And when the teacher gets mad at me, I just think “Why should I listen? No one listens to me anyway!”

Consultant: I understand that feeling of not being heard can be really tough. It seems like that thought makes you feel even more defiant in those moments. How do you think that thought impacts your relationships with your classmates and teachers?

User: Well, I guess I push them away. I want to say things to get them to notice me, but I just end up feeling more alone.

Consultant: That makes sense, Little Mo. It’s a way to get attention, but it’s not the kind you really want. What if we worked together to explore some different ways to express what you're feeling? 

User: Like what? I just feel so overwhelmed sometimes.

Consultant: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. We can try some simple techniques, like deep breathing or visualizing a calm place. Would you like to give that a try right now?

User: Okay, I can try. I've heard about deep breathing before.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and let it out through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels a little better. I think I can also feel my heart slowing down.

Consultant: That’s good to hear! Breathing can help you calm down when you're feeling angry or frustrated. Next time you feel like snapping at someone, you can take a moment to breathe before responding. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can do that. I just need to remember to stop and breathe.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating a little space between what you feel and how you react. Can you recall a recent situation in class where you felt like you might react strongly?

User: Yes, just last week, my teacher corrected me, and I wanted to yell at him. 

Consultant: Let’s think about that moment. What specific thoughts went through your mind right before you felt that urge to yell?

User: I thought it was unfair and that he was always picking on me.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Little Mo. When you feel like someone is being unfair, it can make you defensive. But what if we challenge that thought? Is it possible that your teacher corrects you to help you learn?

User: I guess. Maybe he just wants me to do better. 

Consultant: Exactly! Challenge that thought next time you feel the urge to snap. Instead of thinking, “It’s unfair,” you can try thinking, “He’s trying to help me.” How do you think that might change your reaction?

User: Maybe I wouldn’t feel so angry and would just listen to him instead.

Consultant: Yes! It could change everything about how you respond. Now, let’s think about your interactions with your classmates. What do you think makes you act out with them?

User: I don’t like feeling ignored, so I think I overreact when they don’t pay attention to me.

Consultant: That makes sense. You want to be noticed. Instead of acting out, how about trying to express your feelings calmly next time?

User: I can try. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Consultant: One way could be to say something like, “Hey, I really want to share something—I hope you’re listening.” This way, you ask for their attention rather than demanding it through frustration. How does that sound?

User: I could do that! I just have to remember to use my words instead of getting mad.

Consultant: That’s right! You’ll be communicating your needs without the anger attached. Let’s also think about how to manage those feelings when they arise. Have you thought about any activities that help you feel better?

User: Sometimes I like listening to music or drawing, but I haven’t done them much lately.

Consultant: Those are fantastic outlets! Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you release some of that pent-up energy and frustration. Can we set a small goal for you to spend some time each week doing those things?

User: Yes! I could try to draw or listen to music for a bit when I feel upset. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember, it’s all about finding ways to express and manage your feelings. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today?

User: I think I’ve shared a lot. It’s really helped me to talk about what I feel.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Little Mo! You've made great steps today. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about to make sure you feel confident going forward. 

User: Okay! I feel lighter thinking about it all.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Remember, you can return to deep breathing and use positive thoughts to challenge negative ones. You’re doing a great job learning how to express yourself in healthier ways.  

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, Little Mo. Don't hesitate to come back whenever you need to talk or explore more strategies.

Consultant: Hello, little Mo! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit weird. Sometimes I forget my books and don’t finish my homework. I’ve even been crawling around the classroom sometimes!

Consultant: That sounds difficult. It seems like you're feeling a little lost with your schoolwork. Can you tell me more about what happens when you forget your books or when you don’t get your homework done?

User: I get really upset! And then I don’t want to sit at my desk, so I just crawl around instead. I think it’s silly, but I can't help it.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments make you feel frustrated, and you cope by acting in a way that feels more comforting to you, like crawling. Why do you think you choose to do that instead of trying to focus on your work?

User: I don’t know! It just feels easier sometimes. When I crawl, I feel less stressed.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to want to escape from stress. But we can find ways to feel calm while working. What do you think could help you feel more comfortable sitting at your desk?

User: Maybe if I had some rewards for finishing my homework, I could focus better?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea, Mo! Setting up a reward system can be very motivating. What rewards do you think you would like for completing your homework?

User: I really like video games! Maybe I could earn some game time for finishing my assignments.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun reward! We can create a plan where you earn some time for each task you complete. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s write down some steps for your plan, and we can check in about how it’s going in our next session. Now, are there any moments at school when you feel particularly anxious or distracted besides missing your books?

User: Sometimes I feel really nervous during class or when I have to speak in front of everyone. It’s scary!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in those situations. Let’s think about ways you can ease that anxiety. Have you ever tried taking deep breaths or thinking positive thoughts before speaking?

User: No, I’ve never thought about that. I usually just try to avoid talking.

Consultant: Avoiding talking is a common reaction. But what if we practice some deep breathing together right now? It might help you feel more relaxed when you do need to talk in class.

User: Okay, I can try.

Consultant: Alright, let's take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth. Good job! How did that feel?

User: It felt nice! I think I can use that when I’m nervous.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Breathing can really help calm our minds. Aside from the classroom, are there any events at home that have been bothering you?

User: Well, my parents argue a lot. It makes me feel uneasy. I wish they would just stop.

Consultant: It’s understandable that their arguments would make you feel worried. It can be really tough living in a situation like that. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how this affects you?

User: Not really. I feel like it’s not my place to say anything.

Consultant: Your feelings are important, Mo. You have every right to express them. Maybe we could think about some safe ways to communicate about how you feel regarding your family situation?

User: I guess I could write down my feelings and share them with someone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing can be a great way to express yourself. Would you feel comfortable sharing those feelings with someone you trust, like a teacher or a friend?

User: Yeah, I think I could try that.

Consultant: That sounds promising, Mo! It's good to find someone to share your feelings with. Our time is almost up for today, but I want you to remember you’re doing a great job working through these challenges. 

User: Thanks! This feels a lot better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s make a plan. This week, try using the reward system for your homework and practice the deep breathing for your nerves. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’ll try my best.

Consultant: I believe in you, Mo! Remember, it's okay to ask for support. We’ll talk about how it went in our next session. Take care until then!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, 小莫! I’m glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to adjust to everything, but sometimes I still feel worried about my family. It’s tough with my parents being apart.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Adjusting to changes in family dynamics can be challenging. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you regarding your parents’ separation?

User: I often think about whether they will get back together. It makes me anxious when they argue, even if it's not happening right now.

Consultant: It's natural to have concerns about your parents' relationship and how it might affect you. Have those feelings impacted your daily life or your interactions with others at school?

User: Sometimes, I get really upset and can’t focus on my schoolwork. I feel like I’m more sensitive to things, and I react strongly when things go wrong.

Consultant: Being sensitive to your surroundings, especially during family turmoil, is quite common. You mentioned that you’ve been working on your relationships with friends. How has that been going for you?

User: I’ve been hanging out with my friends more, which helps a little. They make me feel less alone, but I still have a lot on my mind.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve been spending time with friends. That can be an important source of support. What sorts of things do you enjoy doing when you’re with them?

User: We play games and talk about random stuff. It feels good to laugh and forget about everything for a bit.

Consultant: Laughter and shared experiences can be very healing. It sounds like those moments bring you some relief. When you’re feeling worried at home, what do you usually do to cope?

User: I usually just try to distract myself, like watching TV or playing video games. But it doesn’t always work. Sometimes, I just feel sad again.

Consultant: Distraction can be a temporary solution, but it seems like those feelings of sadness often return. Let’s explore what happens when you feel sad. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind during those moments?

User: I think about how things used to be when my parents were together. I miss that. It feels unfair that they can’t get along.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re mourning a sense of stability and connection. It’s entirely normal to grieve for the past. If you could express your feelings to your parents about this change, what would you want to say?

User: I would tell them I want them to be happy, but I also want to feel secure and not worry about fights.

Consultant: That’s a really important thing to communicate. Finding a way to express your needs is a big step. Let's consider ways you could approach that conversation. What support do you think you would need to talk to your parents about how you feel?

User: I guess I would need to feel calm before talking to them, so I don’t get too emotional.

Consultant: That's a wise thought. Finding a calm moment might help you articulate your feelings better. What could you do to prepare yourself emotionally before such a conversation?

User: Maybe I could write down my feelings or practice what I want to say with a friend.

Consultant: Writing down your feelings is a great strategy! It helps clarify your thoughts and can ease some anxiety. Would you like to role-play how you might start that conversation with your parents?

User: Sure, that could help. I just want to say it in a way that they understand.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine the scene. You’re sitting with your parents, and you start by saying, “I’ve been feeling worried about…”

User: “I’ve been feeling worried about you two fighting and how it affects me. I want us to be okay, but sometimes I feel really insecure.”

Consultant: That sounds very heartfelt and honest. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I hope they would listen, but sometimes I feel like they don't understand me.

Consultant: It’s possible they might not fully get it right away. It’s important to stay open to their responses. If they seem unsure, you can guide them back to how their actions affect you. How does that make you feel, thinking about sharing your feelings?

User: I feel a bit nervous but relieved at the same time. At least it feels like I’m doing something.

Consultant: That relief is a positive sign. Taking action, even in small steps, can empower you. As we wrap up today, what do you think your biggest takeaway from our conversation has been?

User: I think talking about my feelings is important, and I need to find ways to cope better with my emotions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing the importance of expressing your feelings and developing coping strategies is a great step forward. Remember, it’s okay to feel a range of emotions, and you’re not alone in this. Whenever you need to talk, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after this conversation.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, 小莫! I’m glad to hear that. Keep practicing those strategies, and we can explore more next time. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomo! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling okay, I guess. I think I'm getting used to my mom working more and not being home so often. But sometimes I still feel a bit sad about it.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're starting to adjust to your mom's work routine. Feeling sad about the changes in your family is completely normal. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel sad sometimes?

User: Well, I miss spending time with her. Sometimes I hear my friends talking about their family time, and I feel a bit jealous. I wish things were the way they used to be.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really missing those moments with your mom. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you see your friends having different experiences. What do you think might help you feel more connected to her, even when she's busy?

User: I think if I could talk to her more when she’s home, that would help. But sometimes, I don't even know what to talk about.

Consultant: Communicating can be tough, especially after things have changed. How about we think of some topics or questions you could ask her when she is around? What do you think you'd like to share with her?

User: Maybe I could tell her about school and ask what she does while she's away. But I also feel nervous about bringing it up.

Consultant: That’s a good start! You mentioned feeling nervous. Can you share what makes you feel nervous about talking to her?

User: I guess I worry that she'll be too busy or that she won’t want to talk. I don't want to bother her after a long day at work.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that, but remember that sharing your feelings is important for both of you. What if you framed it in a way that shows you care about her too? For example, asking about her day might open up the conversation.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could ask about her work and then lead into how school has been for me.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! This can help you feel more connected. Let's practice this together. Pretend I’m your mom, and you can start the conversation. What would you say?

User: Um, maybe I could say, “Hi Mom! How was work today? I want to tell you about what we did in school.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to start the conversation! It shows interest in her life and opens the door for you to share your experiences too. How does it feel to practice this way?

User: It feels okay. I’m still a little nervous, but it helps to say it out loud.

Consultant: I'm glad it feels okay! It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Let’s think about what you can do if you feel that way when it’s time to talk to her. What strategy might help you stay calm?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath before talking or remind myself that she loves me no matter what.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Taking a deep breath can really help calm your nerves, and remembering your mom's love can bring comfort. How about thinking of a little plan for when she comes home next?

User: Yeah! I could make a list of things I want to talk about, and then I won’t forget anything.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Xiaomo! Having a list can help you feel more organized and confident in sharing. Let’s work on that list together. What’s the first thing you’d want to write down?

User: I think I want to write down “ask about her work,” then I can talk about my school. 

Consultant: Perfect! You’re planning wisely. What else could you add to the list?

User: Maybe I could write down how I feel about her being away and that I miss spending time with her.

Consultant: That’s very brave of you, Xiaomo. Sharing your feelings is important for strengthening your relationship. How do you think she might respond to your feelings?

User: I think she would understand. I hope she would try to spend more time with me if I tell her.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you believe she would understand. Expressing your feelings can create opportunities for more family time, which you miss. How do you feel about discussing your feelings with her now, after thinking through this plan?

User: I feel a bit more confident! I think I can do it if I follow my plan.

Consultant: I’m so proud of you! You’ve made great progress today. As we wrap up our session, let's reflect on the steps you've taken. What would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our time together?

User: I think it’s that I can talk to my mom about how I feel, and it might make things better between us.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiaomo! You've taken a significant step towards understanding and communicating with your mom. Keep practicing those strategies, and when you feel ready, give it a try. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I’m excited to start talking to her more.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’re making great strides in understanding your feelings and relationships. Don't forget, if you need more support, I'm here for you. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I’ll let you know how it goes.
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaomo! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've been working on some positive changes recently. How have you been feeling about your family and school since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better, actually. My relationship with my mom has improved a lot, and I’ve been more involved in school activities. It feels nice to be part of the class.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your connection with your mom and your involvement in school have brought you some happiness. What specific moments or events stand out to you that contribute to this improvement?

User: Well, we started talking more, and she even came to see my school play. I felt proud to show her what I’ve been doing. Also, I made a few new friends while working on the class project.

Consultant: Those are great achievements! It’s wonderful that your mom was able to support you and watch you perform. Building friendships is also a significant part of feeling connected. How do you feel about these relationships at school now?

User: I feel a lot more comfortable. I used to worry about saying the wrong thing or not being liked, but now I just try to be myself. It’s really fun to hang out with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy attitude! Embracing who you are can lead to stronger connections. Can you tell me about any challenges you’ve faced recently, even with these improved relationships?

User: Sometimes I still get worried when I think about my grades. Even if I’m doing okay, I feel like I have to always be perfect. I’m scared that if I don’t do well, everyone will be disappointed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure, especially when you care about doing well. Let’s explore that belief together. What evidence do you have that your friends or family would be disappointed if you didn’t achieve perfection?

User: Well, my mom used to say that I should always try my best. I guess I just feel like if I don’t meet those expectations, it means I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially when people encourage you to do your best. But remember, everyone makes mistakes and has ups and downs. What would you say to a friend in your position, facing similar thoughts about their performance?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to not be perfect and that everyone has their struggles. I’d want them to know that it doesn’t define who they are.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! If you can extend that compassion to a friend, it’s something you can offer to yourself too. Let’s consider a situation where you don’t meet your expectations. How might you respond to yourself in a kinder way?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I should focus on what I learned instead. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframe! Focusing on growth instead of perfection can help reduce anxiety. Are there any specific strategies you think might help you remember to be kinder to yourself?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to write down my feelings and remind myself of my successes, even the small ones.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a perfect idea! Reflecting on your feelings and successes can be empowering. Do you want to set a specific goal for how often you’ll write in your journal?

User: I think I’d like to write in it every week, so I can keep track of what’s going well.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Writing weekly will help you keep your progress in mind and reinforce those positive thoughts. How do you feel about sharing your journal entries with someone, like your mom or a trusted friend, if you feel comfortable?

User: I think that could help! If I let my mom read it, she might understand more about what I’m going through.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Xiaomo! Sharing your thoughts could help strengthen your relationship even more. As we near the end of our sessions, let's reflect on everything you've accomplished. How do you feel about the changes we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel proud of myself for making progress and having some strategies to deal with my worries. I think I’m getting better at accepting myself.

Consultant: You should be proud! You have worked hard to improve your self-acceptance and communication. As we wrap up, what strategies do you plan to use to maintain these positive changes in the future?

User: I’ll keep journaling, talk more with my mom, and try to join in on more activities at school. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies, Xiaomo! Keep nurturing those habits, and remember, it’s okay to ask for help if you need it. This session has been productive, and I believe you’re equipped to manage your emotions moving forward. If you ever want to revisit our sessions or need assistance, you are always welcome to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate everything. It’s been really helpful having this space to talk. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you found our sessions helpful. Best of luck on your continued journey, and take care!
