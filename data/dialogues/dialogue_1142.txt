Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you could join me today. I understand that you've been feeling anxious about your relationships with your classmates and the pressure of preparing for your exams. Can you share a bit more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really stressed lately. It seems like my classmates are ignoring me, and I feel so lonely. I'm trying to prepare for my graduate school exams, but this tension is making everything harder.

Consultant: I see. It sounds tough to feel isolated during a challenging time like this. When you mention that your classmates are ignoring you, how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It really makes me feel worthless. I keep thinking maybe they don't like me or don’t want to include me in their study groups. It just amplifies my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds very painful, especially when you're trying to focus on your studies. It seems like this situation has led to some negative thoughts about yourself. What kinds of thoughts come up for you when you feel this way?

User: I think, "What if I'm just not good enough?" or "Maybe they're right to exclude me; maybe I don't fit in." Those thoughts keep spinning in my mind.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound heavy and quite critical. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your emotions or actions in social situations with your classmates?

User: Yes, I feel even more anxious and end up avoiding them altogether. I don't want to embarrass myself further.

Consultant: Avoidance can feel like a safe choice in the moment, but it often makes the situation worse in the long run. Let’s explore together: what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you don’t fit in or aren’t good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have solid proof; it's just how I feel. I see them laughing and talking, and I feel like an outsider.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you're observing interactions from the outside. But let's think about it
—would you say that you sometimes may interpret their behavior in a way that might not reflect reality? 

User: I can see that. I might be assuming things without knowing what they really think.

Consultant: Exactly. Sometimes our feelings can cloud our perception of reality. If a friend of yours was in a similar situation, what would you tell her about her worth and fitting in?

User: I would tell her that everyone has their insecurities and that she is valuable just by being herself.

Consultant: That's a nurturing thought! Now, how might you start to treat yourself with the same kindness? 

User: Maybe I should remind myself that I'm doing my best and that it's okay not to be part of every conversation.

Consultant: That's a huge step toward self-compassion! Let’s also consider actionable steps. What if you tried initiating a small conversation with a classmate next time? How would that feel for you?

User: I feel scared just thinking about it. What if they respond negatively?

Consultant: It's natural to feel scared, especially when you're feeling vulnerable. But remember, each small step can build your confidence. Perhaps even preparing a simple question or comment in advance could make it easier. What do you think?

User: I could try that... maybe asking about a class assignment or something related to our studies.

Consultant: That sounds great! It provides a natural opening for interaction. How might you feel if you receive a positive response from them?

User: I think that could really boost my confidence and make me feel more connected.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on those potential positive outcomes can help reframe your mindset. What's one thing you can do this week to take a step toward that goal of connecting with your classmates?

User: I think I’ll try to ask someone about a study group to see if they'd want to include me.

Consultant: Excellent choice, Xiaoyu! Remember, it's okay to feel a little anxious about it; what matters is that you're willing to take that step. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. It’s nice to have a plan instead of just feeling lost.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've already made significant progress just by recognizing your feelings and setting a goal. Let's check back and see how that conversation goes next time. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: No matter the outcome, remember this is a practice, and each attempt helps build your confidence. You've shown great courage in facing this situation. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It helps to talk about it.

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Xiaoyu. We’ll continue to explore your feelings and use our sessions to provide you with tools to navigate these challenges. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I'm looking forward to trying out what we talked about!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear. Before we end today’s session, let's summarize what you’ll work on until we meet again. You’ll prepare a question for your classmate and practice reaching out.

User: Yes, I’ll write it down to remember.

Consultant: Perfect! And as you practice self-compassion, remind yourself that you are worthy of connection. I'm confident you’ll do great. Until next time, Xiaoyu!

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more open and friendly with my roommates, but I feel even more lost and unconfident because I'm not getting the responses I hoped for.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're putting in effort to connect with your roommates, but it's not leading to the positive interactions you were hoping for. Can you tell me more about those interactions and how they made you feel?

User: Well, I tried to start conversations and share some of my thoughts, but they just seem disinterested. It really makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: It sounds quite frustrating and disheartening when you’re making an effort, yet it doesn’t get the feedback you expected. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think maybe I'm not interesting enough or that they don’t actually care about what I say. It makes me withdraw even more.

Consultant: I see. So, these thoughts lead you to withdraw further from your roommates. Let's explore this a bit more. How accurate do you think those negative thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports them?

User: I guess I can't say for sure. Maybe they just seem busy or preoccupied. But it’s hard to shake the feeling that I'm not valuable to them.

Consultant: That’s a very important insight, Xiaoyu. Often, when we feel anxious or rejected, we jump to conclusions. What if we challenge those thoughts? If a friend were in your shoes, what might you tell her about feeling unvalued in the situation?

User: I would probably tell her that it doesn't mean she isn't valued. People can have their reasons for not engaging.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to recognize that their behavior might not be a reflection of your worth. What could you try to remind yourself of your own value in social situations?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of positive interactions, no matter how small, to remind myself that I can connect with others.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping track of positive experiences can help shift your focus from negative interpretations to positive interactions. How do you feel about starting this practice in the coming week?

User: I feel hopeful; that sounds doable. I just need to remember to do it consistently.

Consultant: Great! Consistency will help reinforce the positive aspects of your social interactions. Is there any specific interaction this week that you could reflect on for your journal?

User: I think I can try to join my roommates for dinner and share a bit about my day. I’ll see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember to focus on the experience itself, regardless of how they respond. After the dinner, how about reflecting on how it made you feel, both during and after?

User: Yes, that’s a good idea. I’ll try to gather my feelings and thoughts afterward.

Consultant: Perfect! By doing this, you’re actively engaging and ensuring to validate your own experiences. How are you feeling about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit more confident, like I have a plan. I hope it helps ease my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Taking proactive steps can indeed reduce anxiety. Remember, you’re learning and growing in this process. Are there any concerns you have about this approach? 

User: I worry that I’ll still feel rejected if it doesn’t go well. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s okay to feel that way. But let's think about it this way: even if the outcome isn’t as positive as you hope, every experience is a learning opportunity. What can you tell yourself to help manage those feelings of rejection if they arise?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it doesn’t define my worth and that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your effort and inherent worth regardless of external validation is key. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to hold onto for the week ahead?

User: I want to remember that my efforts to connect are valuable, and that I shouldn’t let negative thoughts take over.

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway, Xiaoyu. You’re building a healthier mindset and social skills, and that takes time. I believe you can accomplish this. If you need further guidance, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more encouraged to try again.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you're taking, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care, Xiaoyu! 

User: Take care, thank you!

Consultant: Hello, little fish! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your interactions with your classmates lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious about it. I realized that I don't participate much in group activities, and during the last event, I felt really distant from everyone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected and unsure in social situations. What specific moments made you feel this way during the event?

User: Well, I noticed that when others were discussing ideas, I hesitated to share my thoughts. I couldn't find the right moment to jump in, and I just felt overlooked.

Consultant: That must have been really frustrating for you. It's common to feel anxious about speaking up, especially in group settings. What do you think holds you back from sharing your thoughts?

User: I guess I worry that my ideas won't be good enough or that people won't be interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those concerns. Let's explore this a bit more. When you think about expressing your ideas, what emotions come up for you?

User: I feel nervous and sometimes a little embarrassed. It's just hard for me to be assertive around others.

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is a great first step! Let’s try to reframe how you view sharing your thoughts. What if, instead of focusing on proving yourself, you thought of it as sharing your perspective and contributing to the discussion?

User: I never thought of it that way. That sounds less intimidating. But I still struggle to find the courage to speak up.

Consultant: Finding the courage can take practice. How about we discuss some small social tasks you could try to gradually increase your comfort in sharing?

User: That would help! I want to feel more confident in participating.

Consultant: Excellent! One idea could be setting a goal to make one comment or ask a question in your next group discussion. How does that sound to you?

User: That seems manageable! I think I could try to contribute at least once.

Consultant: Great! Let's also practice how you might introduce your thoughts. Can you share an opinion or idea on a recent topic you discussed with your classmates?

User: Well, recently we talked about current events, and I have some opinions on climate change that I'd like to share.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s role-play a scenario—imagine you’re in that group discussion. How would you start sharing your opinion on climate change?

User: I would say something like, “I recently read an article that made me think about climate change in a different way. I believe…” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It's concise and opens up the conversation. How do you feel about that introduction?

User: It feels better when I frame it like that. But I still worry about how others will respond.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern. Instead of focusing on their reactions, try to concentrate on expressing your thoughts. What's the worst that could happen if they disagree?

User: I guess they might just have a different opinion, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world.

Consultant: Exactly! Disagreements can lead to enriching discussions. Would it help to remind yourself of this perspective before speaking up in the group?

User: Yes, I think it would help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, remember to take a deep breath before you speak; it can help calm your nerves. How do you feel about these strategies for your next group interaction?

User: I feel more prepared. I’ll definitely try them out!

Consultant: That's great to hear! I'll encourage you to treat each interaction as a learning experience. What do you think you might learn from trying these new approaches?

User: I guess I’ll learn if my contributions are valuable and if I can express myself better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each time you participate, you’re gaining experience and confidence. We can check back next time on what worked and where you might want to improve.

User: Yes, I look forward to it! I hope to feel less anxious and maybe even a bit proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, progress takes time, and every small step counts. I'm here to support you along the way. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, little fish, and have a great week! 

User: Thanks! I appreciate it.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! It's great to see you in today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to engage more with my classmates during group studies, but I still feel pretty anxious about starting conversations. It's hard for me to figure out what to say.

Consultant: I can see how challenging it must be to navigate those social interactions. Let’s explore that a bit. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you’re in those group study sessions?

User: I often worry that I might say something silly or that my classmates won't be interested in what I have to say. It makes me hesitate to speak up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like these thoughts are holding you back from engaging fully. What kind of emotions do these thoughts create for you?

User: Mostly anxiety and frustration. I really want to be part of the discussions, but I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in social situations, especially when you want to make a good impression. Have you noticed any specific situations where you felt more at ease, or perhaps tried to initiate a conversation?

User: Well, in one of the sessions, I managed to ask a question about the study material, and it felt good, but I quickly lost my confidence afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great step! Asking a question is a powerful way to connect with others. What mindset did you have just before you asked the question?

User: I was just thinking about how it would help clarify things for me, but then I started worrying about how they would perceive me after.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like there’s a part of you that recognizes the value of participating, but another part that creates doubt. Let’s challenge that doubt. What evidence do you have that your classmates might not want to hear what you have to say?

User: I guess I don't really have any concrete evidence. It’s more from my own fears about being judged.

Consultant: Exactly. Sometimes our fears can distort our view of reality. What would you tell a friend if they were feeling the same way about contributing to a group?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and that everyone has something valuable to add.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective. You’re telling your friend to embrace their voice, and you deserve to do the same. How can you apply that advice to yourself in your next group study session?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that my thoughts are valuable too and just go for it, rather than overthinking.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful strategy! As you prepare for your next session, what would help you feel more confident in starting conversations?

User: I suppose I could prepare a few questions or topics beforehand to make it easier to jump into discussions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Preparing in advance can really reduce anxiety. Would you like to brainstorm some topics or questions right now that you could use?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I could ask about how they’re studying or discuss the challenges we’re all facing with the material.

Consultant: Great choices! Those topics invite conversation and let others share their experiences too. What do you think might happen if you initiate with those questions?

User: I think it might open up a dialogue… maybe they’ll appreciate my effort and respond positively.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, building connections takes practice, and every step counts. How do you feel about using this approach moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It helps to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, it’s all about small steps. How do you see yourself reflecting on your experiences after your next group study session?

User: I’ll probably try to take note of what worked and what didn’t. That way, I can learn and adjust for next time.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting will help solidify what you’re learning. It’s also about celebrating those small victories, so don’t forget to acknowledge your efforts along the way.

User: Yes, I definitely want to do that! I realize it’s a process.

Consultant: Exactly, Xiao Yu! Every interaction is an opportunity for growth. As we approach the end of our session, what’s your main takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I feel encouraged to take small steps in conversations and remind myself that it’s okay to be anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! You've done a great job recognizing your feelings and developing strategies. How do you plan to keep this momentum going in the coming weeks?

User: I’ll focus on trying out my new strategies in group studies and keep a journal to track my experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I'm so proud of the steps you're taking. If you find yourself needing support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. I feel a lot more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care, Xiao Yu, and embrace your journey ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I hope you’ve had a moment to reflect on our previous session. How are you feeling now?

User: Hello! I’ve been feeling a bit better since our last talk. That positive feedback during the academic discussion really encouraged me, but I’m still worried that I won’t be able to keep that momentum going.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you felt encouraged! It’s completely normal to have concerns about maintaining positive interactions. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?

User: I guess I just fear that those good feelings might fade away, and I won't be able to share my thoughts openly again. It was nice to feel accepted for a moment.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling hopeful yet anxious about future interactions. It’s important to recognize those good feelings and how they positively affect you. What do you think would help you sustain that sense of acceptance in your interactions with classmates?

User: Maybe if I shared more often or reached out to them, it could help. But I hesitate because I don’t want to come off as too pushy or intrusive.

Consultant: That makes sense. Sharing more often sounds like a good strategy! What if we explore some ways you could approach your classmates that feel comfortable for you?

User: Sure! I think starting small might be good, like making casual conversation before or after class without putting too much pressure on it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Casual conversations can help build a more comfortable rapport. What topics do you think you could bring up to initiate those small talks?

User: Maybe discussing our classes or upcoming projects? That could open the door to more conversations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are great topics that everyone likely has thoughts on. How would it feel to initiate a conversation like that?

User: It feels a bit intimidating, but also exciting. I want to see how it goes.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel both excitement and anxiety. How about we identify a specific situation where you could try this approach in the coming days?

User: There’s a group study session this weekend. I could try to chat with them about what we’ll be studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! What would be a way to ease yourself into the conversation during that session?

User: I might start by asking what everyone is focusing on for their studies. That feels like a neutral way to begin.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Starting with something neutral can make the conversation flow more naturally. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself during that study session?

User: I think I could aim to speak to at least two classmates before diving into the study material. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfectly attainable goal! Checking in with two classmates could build your confidence. How would you feel afterward if you successfully initiated those conversations?

User: I think I’d feel proud and more motivated to keep talking to them. It could help break the ice.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small victories is key to building confidence. What can you do to remind yourself to celebrate those moments after the study session?

User: I could write down my feelings afterward or share my experience with a friend to process it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling your thoughts can really help reinforce your positive experiences. How do you envision your feelings changing as you practice these interactions more?

User: I hope to feel less anxious and more confident. Maybe I’ll see these interactions as opportunities instead of challenges.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset shift! Viewing interactions as opportunities can significantly reduce anxiety. What steps can you take to remind yourself of this positive perspective?

User: I might create a small reminder note with some supportive phrases I can read before socializing. 

Consultant: That sounds like a practical tool! Having those reminders can really encourage you. As we approach the end of our session, let's reflect on all the progress you’ve made today. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel more equipped to reach out to my classmates and maintain those connections. I also realized I can focus on celebrating small wins along the way.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization! Remember, building and maintaining relationships takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps. How are you feeling about your social interactions moving forward?

User: I feel more optimistic! I think I can apply what we talked about and see some positive changes.

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that! As you continue to explore these strategies and make connections, remember to be kind to yourself as well. If you encounter challenges, we can always address them together.  

User: Thank you! I’m really looking forward to testing these ideas out. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to talk again. Good luck with your social interactions, and I can’t wait to hear how it goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, dear! I’m glad to see you again today. Last time, we talked about some improvements in your relationships with your friends. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit lighter after talking about it. I’ve been able to share more with my friends. But sometimes, I still feel anxious about how to interact with my classmates, especially since I'm preparing for the graduate entrance exam.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in your friendships, which is wonderful! However, it's understandable to feel anxious about interactions with classmates, especially during such a stressful time. Can you share what specific situations or thoughts make you feel anxious in those interactions?

User: I think it’s mostly when I need to participate in discussions or group projects. I worry that my input won’t be valued or that I might say something wrong. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern, and it’s great that you’re recognizing it. How does that worry affect you emotionally when you’re in those situations?

User: I usually feel nervous and might avoid talking altogether. I don't like feeling that way, but I just freeze up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel nervous in those moments; many people experience something similar. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. When you freeze up, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think, “What if they judge me?” or “I’ll look silly if I don’t know the answer.” 

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts seem quite detrimental and can create a cycle of anxiety for you. Have you considered whether there’s any basis for these worries? 

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence that they would judge me, but I just feel it strongly in the moment. 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! Sometimes, our feelings can amplify our fears, even when the evidence doesn't support them. What if we explored what you'd tell a friend in a similar situation? 

User: I would probably tell them to relax and that everyone makes mistakes. But it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! It shows you have a compassionate side. Let’s try to apply that same logic to how you view your own contributions. When you feel anxious, what would you like to say to yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect and that my thoughts are just as valid as anyone else's.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Practicing self-compassion can really help ease that anxiety. How do you think incorporating that thought might change your experience when interacting with classmates?

User: I think it would help me feel more at ease and maybe even engage more in conversations, which is what I want.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging more can help you build confidence. Let's think about some specific strategies you can use to remind yourself of this affirmation during class interactions. How about setting small goals for participation?

User: That could work. Like aiming to share at least one thought per class or join discussions more actively.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Small, manageable goals can really boost your confidence. What do you think you can do to celebrate your successes, no matter how small?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to track my participation and feel accomplished when I look back on it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can help you see your progress over time and reinforce positive thoughts. How do you feel about initiating conversations with your classmates as you prepare for the exams? 

User: I think if I could practice that, it might ease my tension. Maybe we can form study groups.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant way to combine socializing with studying! Preparing together can help you feel more supported. Would you like to set a goal for reaching out to a classmate this week?

User: Yes, I could message someone and suggest forming a study group. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Wonderful! This step is a great way to enhance both your academic and social life. As we wrap our session today, I’d love to revisit what we’ve covered. What do you feel are your key takeaways?

User: I’ve learned to be kinder to myself about my thoughts, and I have a plan to engage more actively with my classmates.

Consultant: That's a huge achievement! I’m proud of you for recognizing the importance of self-kindness and taking proactive steps in your interactions. How will you maintain this mindset going forward?

User: I think by recalling my affirmations and tracking my participation in a journal, I can remind myself to be proud of my efforts.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have the tools to create lasting change. If challenges arise, remember you can always refer back to these strategies. It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Do you have any final thoughts before we conclude?

User: Just that I feel much more hopeful about interacting with my classmates now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m delighted to hear that. Keep up the great work, and remember, you can always come back if you need support. Take care!
