Consultant: Hello, Qiqi! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been going through a tough time with your roommates, feeling isolated and misunderstood. Let's start by discussing what you've been experiencing lately.

User: Hi. Yeah, I really feel like I've been left out. My roommates act as if I'm not even there, and it makes me feel so lonely and a bit angry. I don't understand why they treat me like this.

Consultant: It sounds really painful to feel ignored and to be in a situation that makes you feel isolated. Can you share more about what specific interactions or moments have triggered these feelings for you?

User: Well, there have been times when they've been laughing and having fun, and I try to join in, but they just look right past me. It's like I'm invisible. I start to think that maybe they really don't want me around.

Consultant: Those moments must feel incredibly hurtful, and it’s understandable to feel that way. What thoughts come to your mind when those situations happen? 

User: I think that I'm just not as interesting as them or that there's something wrong with me. It's like I don't belong there. 

Consultant: It’s really tough to have those thoughts. Let’s explore them a bit. When you think “I don’t belong,” what emotions do you notice within yourself?

User: I feel really sad and frustrated. Sometimes I even feel a bit angry at them for treating me this way. 

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel sad and frustrated when you're experiencing such rejection. It's important to recognize those emotions. Have you noticed if these thoughts affect your behavior with your roommates?

User: I tend to just stay quiet and avoid them more. I don't want to feel more hurt, so I just keep to myself. 

Consultant: I see, so avoiding them seems to be your way of coping right now. But it sounds lonely. What do you think would happen if you tried reaching out to them, even just a little?

User: I’m afraid they’d just ignore me again, and that would hurt even more. 

Consultant: That’s a valid fear, but it’s also worth considering what could happen if they respond positively. Would you be open to discussing how we can frame a small step toward reconnecting with them? 

User: I guess I could try to talk to them about something small, but I’m scared they’ll think I’m weird. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous about that. Perhaps starting with something light, like asking about a show or their plans for the weekend, could open the door a bit. How do you think that would feel for you?

User: I might be okay with that, but what if they brush me off?

Consultant: That’s a fear worth addressing. Remember, their reaction is not a reflection of your worth. We can also prepare some positive affirmations to remind you of your value. How does that sound?

User: That could help. I want to feel more confident, but it’s hard. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Qiqi. We can work on building that confidence together. Let’s list a few affirmations you can remind yourself of when you feel uncertain or anxious.

User: Okay, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s start with something simple like “I am worthy of connection” or “My feelings are valid.” How does that resonate with you?

User: Those sound nice. I think I can try saying them to myself when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Practicing these affirmations can help shift your mindset. How about we set a small goal for you to practice talking to your roommates this week? What feels manageable?

User: Maybe just saying hi when I see them in the common room. That doesn’t sound too scary.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect first step! Saying hi is a great way to break the ice. How do you feel about setting that as your goal for the week?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude, Qiqi! It’s normal to feel anxious about change, but facing it step by step is how we move forward. How about we check in on your feelings and progress in our next session?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I hope I can share some positive experiences.

Consultant: I believe you can! It’s a journey, and each small step counts. Remember to be gentle with yourself, no matter the outcome. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. It makes me feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Let’s revisit this next time we meet, and keep practicing those affirmations. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqi. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty low, to be honest. I still find it hard to connect with my roommate, and it makes me feel even more lonely.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like the situation with your roommate is weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening?

User: I tried to reach out and talk to her, but it didn’t go well. She seemed distracted and didn't really engage with me. I ended up feeling more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds frustrating to feel like your efforts aren’t being met with the response you hoped for. What emotions did that experience bring up for you?

User: I felt really rejected and alone. It made me question if there’s something wrong with me. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It's tough when our attempts at connection don’t turn out as we wish. You mentioned feeling like there's something wrong with you. Can you explore this thought a bit more? 

User: I guess I just feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Maybe it's me who doesn't know how to connect with others.

Consultant: It’s easy to jump to conclusions about ourselves during tough times. What evidence do you have that supports this belief? Have you had any positive interactions with others recently?

User: Well, I do have a few friends from class whom I can talk to. But I still feel that it’s different when it comes to living with someone.

Consultant: It's great to hear you have connections in your classes. The roommate situation feels more intense because you live together, which can amplify feelings of isolation. Let’s think about your beliefs regarding fitting in. Are there times when you felt you did connect with someone?

User: Sometimes when I'm with my classmates, I do feel more comfortable, but it’s not the same at home. 

Consultant: It sounds like there’s potential for connection with friends outside of your living situation. How do you think you might transfer some of that comfort you feel in class to your interactions at home?

User: Maybe if I approach my roommate with the same openness as I do in class, it could help. But I still worry about how she might respond.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about responses, but practice can help ease that anxiety. Would you like to try role-playing a conversation with your roommate? It could be a safe space to explore how you might communicate differently.

User: That sounds interesting! I think I could give it a try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re approaching her. How would you start that conversation? 

User: I guess I could say something like, "Hey, I’ve noticed we haven’t talked much. Do you feel okay?" 

Consultant: That’s a good start—it shows you care about her feelings and opens the door for conversation. How would you feel saying that?

User: I’d feel a bit nervous but also relieved to finally say it. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel nervous; that’s a totally normal response. What if you took a small step this week by trying that? How do you think it might affect your feelings about the situation?

User: I think just trying could help me feel more proactive, and I might feel a little less lonely. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that initiative can empower you. It’s important to acknowledge that small steps can lead to change. How about we explore some more strategies or ways to cope with your feelings of loneliness?

User: Yes, that would be great. I want to feel more confident.

Consultant: One way to build confidence is to reflect on past successes, no matter how small. Can you recall a time when you successfully connected with someone?

User: I remember chatting with a friend about a project, and it felt good to share ideas together.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! Let’s remember that feeling of connection. You can remind yourself that you have the ability to create positive interactions, even if it feels challenging right now.

User: I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Keep focusing on those successes. Over time, you’ll build your confidence in these social situations. How do you feel about your progress so far today? 

User: I feel a bit hopeful after discussing all of this. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoqi. Hope is a powerful motivator. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to hold onto until our next session?

User: I want to remember that I can approach my roommate and that I have friends who support me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I look forward to hearing about your experience next time. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate this. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqi! It's great to see you again. I’d love to hear how you've been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since we last talked. But I still have worries about the atmosphere in my dorm. I sometimes feel anxious about interactions with my roommates.

Consultant: I understand, it’s positive that you’re feeling a bit better, but it’s understandable to still have some concerns. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your dorm relationships?

User: Well, sometimes I feel like my roommates don't really understand me, and I fear they think I'm too shy or distant. It makes me anxious to initiate conversations.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s tough to feel misunderstood, especially in a living situation where you need to interact regularly. Have there been moments that made you feel accepted or supported by your classmates lately?

User: Yes, I've had good conversations with a couple of classmates. They seem to understand me better, which is nice. But then I think about how different it is in the dorm, and I worry it won't change.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’ve found some understanding friends! It’s normal to feel anxious about the dorm dynamics, especially if you’ve had a good experience elsewhere. How do you think you could bring some of that positive interaction from your classes into the dorm?

User: I guess I could try to speak up more or invite my roommates to do things together. But what if they don’t respond well?

Consultant: It’s completely valid to worry about their reactions. But remember, you might be pleasantly surprised! Sometimes taking that first step can lead to better connections. What kind of activities do you think could encourage some bonding with your roommates?

User: Maybe we could watch a movie together or have a small dinner. I think I could suggest it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Watching a movie or sharing a meal can create a relaxed environment for everyone. How would you feel about suggesting this to them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. I just need to find the right moment.

Consultant: Finding the right moment is a good plan. Remember, it’s just about sharing time together and getting to know each other better. What thoughts do you have about how to approach them when the time feels right?

User: I think I could just say something like, “Hey, would you like to watch a movie together this weekend?” It sounds simple, but I’m worried they might say no.

Consultant: That’s a clear and straightforward way to invite them. If they say no, it’s not a reflection of you—it might be due to their plans or preferences. How might you feel if that happens?

User: I guess I would feel disappointed, but I need to remind myself it’s okay. I shouldn’t take it personally.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping that perspective can help. Each time you try reaching out, you’re making an effort to connect. What if you prepare a few other options to suggest if they aren't interested in the first idea?

User: That could work! I could also suggest some board games or a study session if they don't want to watch a movie. 

Consultant: Those are excellent alternatives! It demonstrates flexibility while giving you more chances to interact. Before we wrap up today, what are you planning to do to move forward with this idea?

User: I’ll think about what I want to say and keep an eye out for a good time to suggest it. I really want to make things better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaoqi! You’re taking important steps toward fostering those relationships. Remember, focusing on the positive moments you’ve had can give you the confidence you need. What will you do to remind yourself of those positive experiences before approaching your roommates?

User: Maybe I can jot down the good interactions I’ve had with my classmates. That would help me remember I can connect with people.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Reflecting on those positive experiences can help boost your confidence. As we prepare to end our session, what final thoughts or feelings would you like to share today?

User: I feel hopeful about trying to connect with my roommates now. I think I can handle this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You've made great progress, and I believe you have the tools to create more positive interactions. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you've got this!

Consultant: Hello, Qiqi! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. Being part of the mental health group has helped me a lot. I feel more understood and accepted.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're starting to feel more supported and connected. Can you share some specific moments from the group that made you feel this way?

User: Well, I remember when I shared about my struggles with anxiety, and everyone listened without judgment. It felt good not to be the only one going through these feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful experience, Qiqi. Feeling heard and accepted can really help foster a sense of belonging. How do you think you can carry that sense of support into other social situations?

User: I’m not sure. Sometimes I still feel anxious in larger groups or when meeting new people. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious in new social settings, especially after just starting to share in a supportive environment. What strategies do you think you could use to ease that anxiety when meeting new people?

User: Maybe if I remind myself of the positive experiences I had in the group. It helps to think that others might be understanding, too.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Reflecting on those positive experiences can boost your confidence. Can you think of a specific social situation coming up where you can practice this?

User: I have a friend's birthday party next week. I’m nervous about it, but I want to go.

Consultant: Attending that party sounds like a good opportunity to practice your new skills. What are some small steps you could take to prepare for the party?

User: I could think of a few topics to talk about with others or maybe even remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: Preparing topics to discuss is an excellent tactic! It helps to ease the pressure of coming up with things to say on the spot. How do you feel about using a few positive affirmations before you go?

User: I like that idea! I often tell myself to "just be yourself," but I think I can be more specific with my affirmations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being specific can make them more effective. What affirmations can you create for yourself that align with your experiences in the mental health group?

User: I could say something like, “I am capable of connecting with others, just like I did in the group,” or “I deserve to feel accepted and included.”

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations, Qiqi! Repeating those before the party can help ground you. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself at the party, perhaps to engage with a certain number of new people?

User: That sounds like a good idea! Maybe aiming to talk to three new people would be manageable for me.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s a realistic goal that lets you gradually build your comfort level. Let’s also discuss how you might reflect on the interactions afterward. How could you capture those experiences?

User: I could keep a little journal where I write about the conversations I had and how I felt during them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Journaling can help you analyze your interactions and reinforce your positive feelings. How likely do you think you’ll be able to stick to this plan?

User: I think I can manage that. Knowing I have a way to reflect on my experiences makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Confidence often comes from preparation and reflection. As we prepare to wrap up, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from today's session?

User: I feel like I now have some concrete steps to follow, and I really believe I can apply what I learned in the group to other situations.

Consultant: That's a huge accomplishment, Qiqi! You're transitioning towards feeling more confident socially. Can you share how you plan to maintain this progress moving forward?

User: I will continue to remind myself of the support I feel in the group, and I’ll keep journaling to track my growth.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Keeping a record of your thoughts and experiences will be invaluable. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that you have the tools and support from the group to rely on. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more at ease about the party now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep practicing those skills, and I look forward to hearing about how the party goes in our next session!

User: I will! Talk to you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqi! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. I’ve been meeting new friends through campus activities. It’s helping me feel a sense of belonging, but I still struggle sometimes with my anxiety in social situations.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're meeting new friends! It sounds like you're making positive progress. Can you tell me more about when you experience anxiety during these social interactions?

User: Well, sometimes I overthink what to say or worry if people like me. It makes me hesitate to join conversations, even if I want to engage.

Consultant: That's understandable, Xiaoqi. It can be tough when negative thoughts like that creep in. What kind of thoughts do you notice coming up in those moments?

User: I often think that what I say will be boring, or that people will judge me. It makes me feel really anxious, and sometimes I just stay quiet instead.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts make you feel more anxious and hesitant to engage. Let’s take a closer look at one of those thoughts. For example, you mentioned worrying that what you say will be boring. How true do you think that is, based on your experiences?

User: I suppose I don't really know if that's true. People have been friendly when I do speak up. 

Consultant: That's an important insight. It seems like there may be evidence against that thought. What if we challenged that thinking together? How might you view the situation differently if you were to consider that people enjoy hearing from you?

User: I think I’d feel more confident to share my thoughts. It could help to remind myself that I have interesting things to say.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of your unique voice can help reduce that anxiety. What can you do this week to practice sharing your thoughts more freely in social situations?

User: Maybe I can set a goal to contribute at least once in every conversation I join. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting small, achievable goals can really help build your confidence. How do you feel about that goal?

User: I feel a bit excited! but also nervous, what if I don’t know what to say?

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way. Let’s prepare for those moments. What are some topics or questions you could have ready in your mind to help you engage when you feel stuck?

User: I could ask about their classes or share funny things that happened in mine. 

Consultant: Great ideas! Those can be excellent icebreakers. Practicing those questions may help ease your anxiety when the moment arises. How do you feel about using these strategies?

User: I think they will be helpful! Just talking about it makes me feel a bit less anxious already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Maintaining this positive momentum is key. Let’s check in on how you can reinforce this new habit. What will keep you motivated to engage with your friends more?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of the fun I’ve had when I’ve connected with others. It feels nice to share laughter and stories.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positive experiences can be very motivating. If you start feeling anxious, you can use those memories to remind yourself of the joy that connection brings. How about we set a time to review how this week goes?

User: Yes! I’d love that. I think reflecting on it will help me process everything.

Consultant: Perfect! You can share your experiences and feelings about those interactions. We can assess how your strategies worked and make adjustments if needed. Remember, it's all about the journey of personal growth.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. It really helps to talk through these things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoqi. You're doing fantastic work on yourself! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've committed to. What are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I’ll try to share something in every conversation, keep some topics ready to discuss, and remind myself of the good experiences when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! I admire your commitment to push past your comfort zone. I believe you can continue to build on your social confidence. Before we conclude, is there anything else you want to explore today?

User: No, I think that covers everything. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Me too! I'm eager to hear about your progress. Remember, you have the potential to create meaningful connections, and I’m here to support you along the way. Have a great week ahead!

User: Thank you! You too!

Consultant: Hello Xiaoqi! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling okay, but sometimes I still worry about how I manage my time and tasks. 

Consultant: I’m glad you’re here to share. It’s normal to have concerns about managing everything, especially with school commitments. Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind regarding your tasks?

User: Well, I feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes, especially with deadlines coming up. But I also notice I’m not as anxious as before, which is good.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that your anxiety has decreased! It sounds like you're making progress. Even so, feeling overwhelmed is still a challenge. What does feeling overwhelmed look like for you?

User: I start to doubt myself, thinking I won’t finish everything on time. Sometimes it prevents me from starting my assignments.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would be discouraging. It sounds like there might be some automatic thoughts coming up when you feel overwhelmed. Can you recall any specific thoughts that pop into your mind during those moments?

User: Yes, I often think things like "I will never get this done" or "I’m going to fail." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel pretty heavy and daunting. Let’s explore them a bit. How do those thoughts make you feel when you think about them?

User: They make me feel really anxious and unmotivated. It’s hard to concentrate on anything when I feel that way.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Let’s consider that thought, “I’m going to fail.” What do you think is the evidence supporting that thought? Is there a possibility that it might not be entirely accurate?

User: I guess there are times when I’ve done okay in my assignments, but I still worry. 

Consultant: It sounds like there are some successes to reflect on. If a friend of yours was in this situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I would probably tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that they’ve done well before.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective! It seems you can recognize that there’s a part of you that knows you’re capable. How could you apply that same kindness to yourself when those negative thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself about my past successes and breathe deeply when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Using deep breathing and positive reminders can help shift your mindset. Let’s think about practical ways to implement these strategies. How about creating a study schedule that includes breaks and moments to reflect on your progress?

User: That sounds helpful! I think having a plan would ease some of my anxiety because I’d have a clearer path to follow.

Consultant: Great insight! A structured plan can definitely help you feel more in control. Would you like to brainstorm some specific activities you could include in your study schedule?

User: Yes! I think I should include short breaks and maybe a bit of time to reward myself after completing tasks.

Consultant: I love that idea! Rewards can be a strong motivator. What are some small rewards you could use to celebrate your progress along the way?

User: Maybe it could be something like a favorite snack or a break to watch a short show.

Consultant: Those sound like great rewards! They’re simple yet effective. How do you feel about writing out your study schedule along with these rewards to create a visual reminder for yourself?

User: I think that would really help! Having it written down would make it more real and I could see my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeing your progress can reinforce your motivation. As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on the tools we’ve discussed today. How do you feel about your ability to manage your tasks now?

User: I feel more confident. I think with a plan and the reminder of my successes, I can handle my assignments better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift! You’ve shown great growth, Xiaoqi. Remember that you have the tools to manage those anxious thoughts and empower yourself. As we conclude our session today, what’s one takeaway you want to keep in mind for the future?

User: I want to remember that I can be kinder to myself and that I have done well before. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! I believe in your ability to continue this journey of personal growth. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Xiaoqi!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.
