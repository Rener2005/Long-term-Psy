Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm feeling quite overwhelmed. I thought I could manage my phone usage better, but it hasn't really improved. I feel frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're really struggling with controlling your phone usage, and that frustration must be hard to cope with. Can you share more about what specific moments or triggers have led you to use your phone more than you'd like?

User: Well, when I'm studying, I often get distracted. It's like I can't help but reach for my phone during breaks, and before I know it, I've wasted hours scrolling.

Consultant: It seems like studying is a key trigger for you. Can you describe how you feel before you grab your phone? What thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I feel stressed or bored while studying. I just want a break, and my phone is the easiest way to escape those feelings. But then I end up feeling guilty afterwards.

Consultant: It sounds like you're using your phone as a way to alleviate stress and boredom, but it’s leading to feelings of guilt after. Let's explore this together. What do you think might be a healthier way to take a break that wouldn't lead to those negative feelings afterwards?

User: I'm not sure. I guess I could try going for a quick walk or listening to music instead, but those options don’t feel as satisfying.

Consultant: It makes sense that your phone feels more satisfying because it’s so immediate and engaging. However, those other activities could provide you with a healthier break. How about we try creating a plan for incorporating those alternatives? 

User: That might help. But I feel like I want to reach for my phone no matter what.

Consultant: That's normal! Change takes time, and recognizing that urge is an important first step. How about we set specific short breaks for those activities, maybe starting with 5-10 minutes of a walk after a study session? 

User: That sounds doable. I can try that. But what if I still reach for my phone?

Consultant: If you find yourself still reaching for your phone, it can be helpful to pause and ask yourself what you're really feeling in that moment. Is it boredom, anxiety, or something else? This brings awareness to the trigger, allowing you to address it directly.

User: I think acknowledging the feeling could make a difference. Sometimes I feel anxious about not being connected to my friends.

Consultant: Absolutely, that connection is important. What if we also set aside specific times for socializing with friends on your phone, so you can enjoy that connection without it intruding on your study time?

User: That might work! If I know I have a time to connect, it could help me focus better when I’m studying.

Consultant: It's great that you're open to trying that. Let’s write down your plan for both study breaks with physical activity and scheduled connection times. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, I think writing it down will help me stick to it.

Consultant: Perfect! You could also keep a phone usage log to track how much time you spend on your phone and the activities you do instead. This could provide clarity on patterns and help you make adjustments.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I can see where I might be wasting time.

Consultant: Exactly! By becoming more aware of your usage, you can make informed choices about how to spend your time. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.

User: I just wish I could see results faster. I feel anxious about not improving quickly enough.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Change is often gradual. What steps can we incorporate into your plan to help manage that anxiety about progress? 

User: Maybe I could set small goals and celebrate when I achieve them? 

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Setting small, achievable goals can help motivate you and make progress feel more tangible. What would be a small goal you could start with?

User: I could aim to use my phone for social media only twice a day.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable goal! Would it help to schedule these times in your phone so you have reminders about your plan?

User: Yes, reminders would definitely keep me accountable.

Consultant: Great! It’s all about creating a structure that supports your goals. As we move forward, continue to reflect on how these changes make you feel. 

User: I will. I guess checking in with myself is important too.

Consultant: Definitely! Acknowledging your feelings and evaluating how certain behaviors align with your goals is crucial. It sounds like you’re building a clearer plan for yourself, which is a great step forward.

User: Thanks. I feel a bit more hopeful about managing this now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's a journey, and you're taking important steps toward improvement. For our next session, let’s review your phone usage log and discuss how the new plan is working for you. 

User: That sounds great! I look forward to it.

Consultant: Me too! You’re doing really well by taking these steps. Take care until we meet again, Xiaomei! 

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious honestly. I’ve been trying to track my phone usage, but it’s still hard to stick to my goals. I keep going back to scrolling on my phone even when I want to study or do something else.

Consultant: It seems like you’re struggling with managing your phone usage, which is causing you some anxiety. Let’s explore what specifically is challenging about this for you. Can you describe how you feel when you find yourself using your phone instead of focusing on your studies?

User: I often feel frustrated with myself. I tell myself that I’ll only check my phone for five minutes, but then I end up losing track of time. It makes me anxious about falling behind in my studies.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel frustrated when your intentions don’t align with your actions. Let’s think about the moments when you find it hardest to resist your phone. What tends to trigger that urge for you?

User: Usually, it happens when I'm bored or feeling overwhelmed with my studies. It feels like an easy way to escape those feelings, but then I regret it afterwards.

Consultant: So, boredom and feeling overwhelmed are key triggers for you. It's very common to seek distractions during those times. Would you be open to discussing some alternative activities that could help you cope with those feelings instead of turning to your phone?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I have thought about reading more or going for a walk, but I often just end up reaching for my phone.

Consultant: Those are great alternatives! It sounds like you find it challenging to make that switch. How about we try to connect those activities with specific times during the day when you usually feel overwhelmed? 

User: That makes sense. I often feel overwhelmed right after classes. Maybe I could plan to read or take a walk then instead of scrolling on my phone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Establishing a routine can be really helpful. What if we set up a plan where you use a technique like the Pomodoro method to create structured breaks? You could use a timer to focus on studying for a certain period and then reward yourself with a break to read or walk.

User: I’ve heard of the Pomodoro technique! I think that could work for me. I just need to remember to stick to it.

Consultant: It's all about creating that habit and reinforcing it. How do you feel about starting this week by setting specific study sessions using the Pomodoro technique, along with scheduled breaks for activities you enjoy?

User: That sounds like a plan! I think having those breaks scheduled will help me stay on track. 

Consultant: Great! It’s important to be kind to yourself during this process. If you do find yourself slipping into old habits, try not to be too hard on yourself. Reflecting on what led to that moment can provide valuable insights. How do you feel about managing the expectations you have for yourself during this time?

User: I guess I need to remind myself that change takes time. I often expect to see immediate results and that stresses me out even more.

Consultant: That's a very insightful observation! Maybe we can focus on creating small, manageable goals that lead up to your larger aim of reducing phone usage. Would that help you feel more comfortable with the process?

User: Yes, I think so. If I break it down into smaller steps, it might feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: Exactly! In our next session, we can discuss your progress with this plan and any challenges you may encounter. Remember to celebrate small victories along the way. What else do you think might help you maintain this change?

User: I think sharing my goals with a friend could help. They could check in with me and keep me accountable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having support can make a significant difference. How about we draft a simple message you could share with your friend to explain your goals and ask for their support?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to make sure they understand what I’m trying to do.

Consultant: Let’s outline it together! You can explain that you’re working on reducing your phone usage to improve your focus and that you would appreciate their encouragement and accountability. 

User: That sounds perfect! I feel more positive about tackling this now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Would you like to schedule our next appointment to follow up on your progress?

User: Yes, let’s do that! I look forward to sharing my progress.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience as well. Before we end today, can you reflect on what you hope to achieve by the end of this week with the new strategies we've discussed?

User: By the end of the week, I hope to have successfully implemented the Pomodoro technique and spent less time on my phone, especially during those overwhelming moments.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re capable of achieving this, Xiaomei. Let’s check in on this next time. Take care, and remember to give yourself some grace during the process!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I have been trying to go to the study group and join club activities, but sometimes I feel anxious about it. I still find myself reaching for my phone a lot, and I’m worried about falling back into old habits.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious when facing new challenges. You've taken some great steps to reduce your phone use and socialize more. Can you tell me more about how those activities have been for you?

User: Well, joining the study group has been okay. I enjoy studying with others, but I still get distracted by my phone sometimes. The club activities are fun, but I'm not always sure how to interact with new people.

Consultant: It sounds like you're enjoying the new interactions but also facing some challenges with distractions and socializing. Let's explore that a bit—what thoughts or feelings come up for you when you feel the urge to check your phone during these activities?

User: I think I feel a bit anxious about not knowing what to say to others, so I instinctively look at my phone. It makes me feel a bit better at the moment, but I know it’s not helping me connect with people.

Consultant: That makes sense. Using your phone might feel like a comfort in those moments of anxiety. Can you try to detail how looking at your phone affects your feelings afterward?

User: After I look at my phone, I often feel a mix of relief and guilt. I’m relieved because it distracts me, but then I feel guilty for not being present or engaging with others. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It's a difficult cycle to be in. Let's try to challenge that thought for a moment. What if you told yourself that it’s okay to be anxious, and we can work on strategies to manage those feelings without reaching for your phone?

User: I guess that might help. If I could remind myself that my feelings are valid, it might take some pressure off.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing and validating your feelings is a key step. What are some healthier ways you could cope with that anxiety when it arises in social situations?

User: Maybe I could focus on taking deep breaths or remind myself that it’s okay to have a pause in the conversation. I could also try to ask questions or listen more to others.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies, Xiaomei! Breathing and being present can definitely help you feel more grounded. Would you be willing to practice this during your next club meeting?

User: Yes, I think I can try that. I’ll remind myself to stay in the moment.

Consultant: Great! Now let’s talk about solidifying your goals around phone use. Since you’re actively engaging in these activities, how about setting specific targets on when to limit phone use while you’re at the study group or club?

User: I think setting a rule to keep my phone away during those times could work. Maybe I can check it only after the activity ends.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan! Limiting phone access during those activities will help you focus more on the experience. Should we create a small reward for when you accomplish this?

User: How about treating myself to a little snack or being able to watch an episode of my favorite show afterward?

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Treating yourself afterward can reinforce your goal to engage more fully. Let’s make a commitment to this plan—does that feel manageable for you?

User: Yes! I feel excited about this approach. I want to see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about progress and learning. If things don't go perfectly, we can adjust the plan together. How do you think you could handle it if you do feel the urge to check your phone during your next activity?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of my reward and the reasons I want to stay focused. It would help me refocus.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy, and I believe in your ability to implement it. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your achievements so far. What do you feel has been your biggest victory in this process?

User: I think just being aware of my phone use and actively trying to change it is a big win for me. I'm proud of myself for joining activities and making new friends.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Xiaomei. You've shown great commitment to making positive changes. Moving forward, how can you maintain this awareness so it becomes a part of your routine?

User: I think I need to keep reminding myself of the benefits of being present and staying engaged. I can also check in with myself regularly about my phone habits.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Regular self-checks can be very effective. Remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to have some ups and downs along the way. We can always come back to this in future sessions.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit more motivated and clear about what to do next.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and successes in our next session. Remember, you're doing great!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Mei! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session about your smartphone use?

User: Hi! I guess I've been okay, but I've noticed that on weekends, I really struggle with my phone usage again. It’s like I revert to my old habits, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like the weekends are particularly challenging for you. You’re feeling anxious about slipping back into old habits. Can you share more about what happens on weekends that triggers this?

User: Well, when I have free time, I just find myself scrolling endlessly on social media. It feels like a way to relax, but then I regret it afterward. 

Consultant: I understand. It feels like a double-edged sword; while it provides some relaxation, it also leads to regret afterward. How does it impact your studying and daily life when this happens?

User: When I spend too much time on my phone, I end up neglecting my study schedule. I can’t focus, and it disrupts my sleep too. I miss out on time with friends as well because I’m glued to the screen.

Consultant: It sounds like your phone usage is affecting several important areas of your life, from your studies to your social interactions. Let’s explore your feelings about this. When you realize you're spending too much time on your phone, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I think about all the things I could have accomplished instead, and I feel disappointed in myself. Sometimes I question why I can’t control it better.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that disappointment, especially when you’re aware of the consequences. When those thoughts arise, how do they affect your emotions?

User: They make me feel anxious and even a bit hopeless sometimes, like I’m going back to being addicted to my phone.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiao Mei. It’s understandable to feel hopeless when faced with a challenge like this. Let’s try to pinpoint these thoughts and feelings. Can you identify a specific situation from last weekend that illustrates this struggle?

User: Sure, on Saturday night, I planned to study, but instead, I ended up scrolling through my phone for hours. I intended to study for an exam, but I just lost track of time.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. In that moment, what thoughts were going through your mind before you started scrolling?

User: I thought a little scrolling wouldn't hurt, and I could always catch up later. But then it turned into a few hours.

Consultant: It’s very common to think that a little bit won’t hurt, but it can lead to more time than intended. Let’s analyze this thought—what evidence do you have that suggests this is true, or could there be another way to look at it?

User: I guess I don’t really have evidence. It just feels like it’s okay in the moment, but then I regret it. 

Consultant: It seems like this thought is more based on feelings than facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them about balancing their phone use with studying?

User: I’d tell them to set a timer or schedule specific breaks. That way, they know when to stop.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Setting boundaries can definitely help create a healthier balance. Let’s consider implementing that. How would you feel about setting specific times for phone use, perhaps using a timer?

User: That sounds reasonable. I think having a limited time might help me control it better.

Consultant: It sounds promising! Alongside that, we could also incorporate some relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises. Have you ever tried any techniques like deep breathing or meditation?

User: I’ve heard about meditation but haven’t really done it. I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: Starting can be simple! We can practice a short breathing exercise together now. It can help you feel more in control and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try it?

User: Yes, I’d like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to find a comfortable position. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a couple more times. Now, how do you feel after that exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed, actually. It’s nice to take a moment for myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Relaxation techniques like this can be very beneficial during moments of anxiety or when you feel the urge to reach for your phone again. Can you see this as a potential strategy to incorporate into your routine?

User: Yes, I think I can definitely start doing that!

Consultant: Perfect! As we move forward, let’s make a plan that includes these techniques and a structured schedule for phone use. We’ll check in regularly about how they’re working for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like a solid plan! I feel more optimistic about handling this now.

Consultant: It's wonderful to see that optimism, Xiao Mei! Let’s review and summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’re becoming aware of your triggers, you’ve identified some unhelpful thoughts, and we’ve outlined strategies to manage your phone usage. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think realizing that my thoughts can be misleading was really important. Setting boundaries and practicing relaxation sounds doable and important for me.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Keeping those boundaries and practicing relaxation will definitely provide you with more control. As we wrap up today, let’s think about how you can maintain these positive changes. What will help you stick to your plan?

User: I can keep a journal to track my feelings and usage. I think sharing my progress with friends might also help.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent approach! Keeping a journal can really support your self-reflection. I'm proud of your progress today! Always remember that change takes time, and you’re on the right path. If ever you feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling much better about everything now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Mei! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Keep practicing those strategies and take care. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye! Thank you for all your help!

Consultant: Hello Xiaomei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling really good. I’ve managed to significantly cut down my smartphone usage, and I feel more satisfied with my life. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some great strides. Can you share more about how reducing your smartphone usage has impacted your daily life?

User: Sure! I’ve been sleeping better and focusing more on my studies. I also have more time to meet with friends and enjoy activities that I used to neglect.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems like reducing screen time has enhanced not only your studies but also your social life. What strategies did you use to achieve this reduction in smartphone usage?

User: I set specific time limits for myself and started using apps that track my screen time. I also replaced some phone time with reading and exercising.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It sounds like you found healthy alternatives that keep you engaged. As we summarize your progress today, what do you think has been your biggest accomplishment in this journey?

User: I think the biggest accomplishment is definitely having better control over my time and activities. I feel like I'm in charge of my life again.

Consultant: That's a meaningful realization! Being in control can lead to a more fulfilling life. How do you envision maintaining this positive change moving forward?

User: I want to stick to my limits and continue developing my interests outside of my phone. Maybe create a weekly plan to balance my studies and leisure activities.

Consultant: A weekly plan sounds like an excellent approach! How about we work together to develop a structure for that plan? What activities do you think you would like to include?

User: I’d like to include more reading, some fitness routines, and also time to hang out with friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a well-balanced plan! Let's break it down. How many days a week do you want to dedicate to reading, fitness, and social activities?

User: I could read four times a week, go to the gym three times, and plan one day each week for socializing.

Consultant: Perfect! With your current goals, this schedule seems manageable. How do you feel about including some flexibility in your plan for those weeks when things might get busier with classes or assignments?

User: That makes sense. I think allowing myself to adjust depending on my workload will help reduce any potential pressure.

Consultant: Great insight! It’s important to be kind to yourself and allow for those adjustments. Looking ahead, what challenges do you anticipate that could impact your smartphone usage or your new activities?

User: I think the main challenge might be the stress of upcoming exams or projects. I tend to drift back to my phone when I’m overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We can address that by creating coping strategies for managing stress. Have you considered any specific methods to help keep you away from your phone during those busy times?

User: I could try using time-blocking for my study sessions and add breaks during which I engage in other activities.

Consultant: Time-blocking is an effective technique! This could help keep you focused and allow for short breaks without getting sucked into your phone. How do you feel about trying this out at the start of the new semester?

User: I feel motivated! I really want to make this work.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As we prepare for the end of our session, let’s summarize your action plan. You’ll reduce screen time by sticking to scheduled limits, develop a weekly activity plan, and implement time-blocking for studying. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel like I have a solid plan now. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Xiaomei! You've made impressive progress, and I believe you have the tools to maintain these positive changes. Remember, it's okay to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed in the future.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It has been a pleasure working with you. Today marks the last session for now, but feel free to reach out if you ever need more support. Keep up the great work!

User: I will! Thank you again!
