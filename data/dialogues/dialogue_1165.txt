Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's good to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious lately, especially with swimming class approaching. I'm so worried about how my body might look in a swimsuit.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel that way. It's quite common to feel self-conscious about our bodies in situations like that. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about swimming in public?

User: I just keep imagining how everyone will look at me and how they'll notice my chest isn't symmetrical. It makes me feel embarrassed and scared.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of negative thoughts about how others will perceive you. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think these thoughts are based on actual experiences, or are they more like assumptions?

User: They feel like assumptions. I haven’t had any direct negative comments, but I can't shake off the fear.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Zhang. Recognizing that these are assumptions rather than facts can be the first step toward challenging those thoughts. What evidence do you have that people will judge you negatively?

User: I don't really have any solid evidence... It's just what I imagine might happen.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries, but since they're based on imagination rather than evidence, we can work on reframing them. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about their body in a swimsuit?

User: I would probably tell them that people are usually focused on themselves and not to be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate way to approach it. It seems that you know how to offer kindness to others. Now, how can you apply that same kindness to yourself?

User: I guess I could try to tell myself to be less critical. Maybe think about my strengths instead.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your strengths can help boost your self-acceptance. Could you share what strengths or positive qualities you appreciate about yourself?

User: Well, I think I'm a good student and I have supportive friends. I'm also trying to take care of my health through exercise.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Zhang! It's essential to hold onto those aspects of yourself amidst the anxiety. Can we think of some small steps you could take to gradually expose yourself to wearing a swimsuit in a more comfortable setting?

User: Maybe I could start by wearing it at home when no one is around. That might help me get used to it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Practicing in a safe environment can help you build confidence. How do you feel about giving that a try?

User: I think I could do that. It sounds less intimidating than swimming in public right away.

Consultant: That's a positive approach! Gradual exposure can help ease your anxiety. Once you feel comfortable at home, we can talk about other settings to help you feel more ready. What about your studies? How have you been able to focus lately?

User: It's hard to concentrate. I find myself distracted, thinking about my body and the swimming class instead of studying.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. When anxiety is high, it can be challenging to focus on other tasks. What strategies have you tried to help with your concentration?

User: I’ve tried studying in shorter bursts, but my mind keeps wandering back to my worries.

Consultant: Short bursts can be effective. Let’s consider incorporating some mindfulness techniques before studying. Would you be open to trying some relaxation exercises to help refocus your mind?

User: Sure, I think that could help. I'm willing to give it a shot.

Consultant: That's the spirit! We can explore some simple breathing exercises together. Just taking a few moments to connect with your breath can help ground you. How about we try that right now?

User: Okay, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in together... and out. As you breathe in, imagine filling your mind with calm thoughts. And as you breathe out, let go of any tension or worry. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice. I can feel a bit of weight lifting off my shoulders.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Regular practice can help you manage anxiety better over time. How do you think you might integrate this into your study routine?

User: I could take a few minutes to breathe deeply before I start studying. That sounds doable.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a simple yet effective strategy. Most importantly, remember to be patient with yourself as you work through these feelings. You’re making progress, even if it feels slow at times.

User: Yes, I understand. I just hope I can overcome this anxiety.

Consultant: You’ve already taken significant steps toward facing your fears. Just keep reminding yourself of your strengths and practicing self-compassion. Lastly, as we wrap up for today, what’s something you feel you’ve learned about yourself during our session?

User: I learned that I can be kinder to myself and that my worries are often just assumptions. That gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization, Zhang! Being kinder to yourself is an important step towards acceptance. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you're welcome to reach out anytime. I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with anxiety, especially when I’m around other people. It's been hard to concentrate on my studies, especially after that swim training incident.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing some lingering anxiety about how others perceive you, which is affecting your ability to focus on studying. Let's start by exploring what you felt during that swimming training. Can you share more about that experience?

User: Well, during the training, I was really self-conscious about my swimwear. I kept worrying that people were looking at me because of my breast asymmetry, and it made me feel really uncomfortable. I think it affected how well I performed and even how much I wanted to participate.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Zhang. It's tough when we feel overly scrutinized. Let's talk a bit about your thoughts during that training. What was going through your mind at the time?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me. Like, I felt they would think I look strange or different because of my body. It really made me anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts must have been overwhelming. Can you remember if any specific feelings accompanied those thoughts? How did they affect you emotionally?

User: I definitely felt embarrassed and anxious. It was like my heart was racing, and I couldn't focus on anything else. I just felt like I wanted to disappear.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed and anxious in that situation is completely understandable. Let’s reflect on your thoughts. Do you think there might be any cognitive distortions in how you perceived their judgment? For example, do you think you might have been jumping to conclusions about what they thought?

User: Yes, I suppose I was making assumptions. I didn’t actually know what people were thinking, but my mind just took off with these negative ideas.

Consultant: Recognizing those assumptions is a significant step. Now, if a friend were in a similar situation, how might you advise them to view their feelings and those judgments?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to be different and that most people are focused on themselves rather than judging others. They should just enjoy the moment.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you can be compassionate to others but struggle to extend that kindness to yourself. How might you apply that same kindness when you're experiencing self-doubt?

User: I could try to remind myself that it's really not as bad as I think and that people might not even notice those things about me.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing self-compassion can help. Let’s try a small exercise. The next time you start feeling anxious in a social situation, tell yourself, “I don’t know what others are thinking, and it’s okay to be different.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! In addition to these thoughts, let’s think about some actionable steps. Are there small social situations coming up where you could practice this new mindset?

User: Yes, there's a small gathering with friends this weekend. I usually feel anxious about those, but I want to go.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Before the gathering, you can write down your thoughts and reminders to help you stay focused on the positive. Would you consider preparing for it in that way?

User: Yes, I think writing things down could help calm me before I go. 

Consultant: That’s a good plan! And while you’re there, try to engage with your friends. What activities do you enjoy that might help take your mind off your worries?

User: I like playing games with my friends. That usually distracts me.

Consultant: Playing games is a fantastic way to connect with others and have fun! Let's also practice some relaxation techniques before the gathering to help reduce your anxiety when the day arrives. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that! I could use some relaxation techniques.

Consultant: Great! We can introduce some breathing exercises or grounding techniques to use in the moment. Let's make sure you feel equipped and confident. Would you like to try a breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, I’d love to!

Consultant: Alright, let's take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Can we do this together a few times?

User: Sure! That feels really calming.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you can repeat this exercise any time you start feeling anxious or overwhelmed. As we wrap up today, what do you think has been the most helpful for you from our session?

User: I think recognizing those negative thoughts and having a new approach for social situations really helps. I feel like I have some tools to try now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Zhang! Being aware of your thoughts and having strategies to address them is a huge step. As you work on these techniques, what would you say is your biggest takeaway today?

User: My biggest takeaway is to have more self-compassion and to remind myself that it’s okay to feel different.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing your differences and treating yourself kindly can create a more positive mindset. Remember, progress takes time, and you're doing great. Is there anything specific you'd like to achieve before our next session?

User: I really want to feel more relaxed and enjoy my time with friends. I want to feel like I can connect better with them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal. Let’s aim for that! I believe you have the ability to make this happen. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. I look forward to hearing how it goes. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful about everything.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I’m here to support you. See you at our next session, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling lately about your social interactions? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite isolated. I really want to improve my relationship with my friends, but I'm still worried about participating in social activities.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like connecting with your friends is important to you. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you felt this way?

User: Well, during a recent trip with my friends, I avoided the water activities because I was self-conscious about my body. They seemed to enjoy themselves, and I felt left out.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling left out while your friends are having fun. What thoughts came to your mind in that moment, and how did it make you feel?

User: I thought they might judge me for how I look, and it made me feel embarrassed and sad. I just wanted to blend in but ended up feeling even more isolated.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. When you thought your friends might judge you, did that thought also bring up any other emotions or reactions? 

User: Yes, it made me anxious and frustrated. I wanted to join them but feared I wouldn't enjoy it if I felt self-conscious.

Consultant: It’s good that you recognized that connection between your thoughts and feelings. Can we explore those thoughts you were having a bit more? 

User: Sure. I guess I thought that my friends were really focused on my looks rather than having fun together. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let's challenge that thought a little—do you think your friends are really focused on how you look, or could it be that they are more engaged with enjoying the moment together?

User: I suppose they are more focused on having fun. They’ve never actually said anything negative about my appearance.

Consultant: Exactly. It seems like you might be interpreting their enjoyment through your own worries. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that their friends care more about their company than their appearance.

Consultant: That’s a great way to look at it! So, what if we tried to view the situation from that perspective? How might that change how you approach social activities in the future? 

User: I guess it could help me feel less anxious about joining in. Maybe I could focus more on having fun rather than worrying about how I look.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! Would you be willing to plan a small social event where you can practice this mindset? 

User: Yes, I think I could try. Maybe I could join my friends for a movie night or something low-key. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect idea! It’s a comfortable setting to ease into socializing again. How might you remind yourself to focus on the enjoyment rather than your concerns during that night? 

User: I could remind myself that my friends like me for who I am, not how I look. I could also prepare some fun conversation topics to engage with them.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! It might also help to have a mantra—something simple like “I’m here to have fun with my friends.” How do you feel about incorporating that? 

User: I like that! I think it could help me shift my focus when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Excellent! Moving forward, what steps can you take to keep this momentum going and further build your confidence?

User: I could try to attend more gatherings, even if they make me nervous. Maybe include my friends in planning to make it less intimidating.

Consultant: Involving your friends in the planning sounds like a great strategy! It could help you feel more at ease. Let’s also consider how to handle moments of anxiety when they arise.

User: Yes, I often feel a wave of panic before social events. It would be helpful to have a strategy for that.

Consultant: Absolutely. Deep breathing exercises can be very effective. When you feel that anxiety, taking a few deep breaths could help center you. How does that sound? 

User: That sounds doable. I often forget to breathe when I'm anxious.

Consultant: It’s common to do so! Practicing deep breathing regularly can help train your body to respond calmly during those moments. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise now? 

User: Sure, I’d like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s inhale deeply for four seconds... hold for four... and exhale slowly for four. How does that feel for you? 

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It’s nice to take a breather like that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you feel a bit more relaxed. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session? 

User: I think recognizing that my friends are there for me, not to judge me, is really important. Also, practicing some coping strategies will help a lot.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, and I’m proud of you for making these connections. I believe you have the tools to keep building on this progress. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling more motivated to try interacting more with my friends.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhang! Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you ever feel uncertain, just reach out. I’m here to support you. 

User: I will. Thank you for your help today! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. I’m still nervous about fitting in completely, but I’ve started to feel some support from my peers in activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive development! It’s great that you’re starting to experience support from your peers. Could you share more about the activities you’ve been participating in and how that has made you feel?

User: Sure! I recently joined a study group and participated in some campus events. At first, I was really anxious about talking to people, but I found myself enjoying the conversations and interactions.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re finding enjoyment in those interactions! What do you think contributed to that feeling of relaxation in those group settings?

User: I think it’s mainly because everyone was so friendly and welcoming. It made me feel less anxious and more at ease.

Consultant: Feeling welcomed can certainly ease anxiety. Have there been any specific moments in those interactions that stood out to you?

User: Yes, there was one moment during a group discussion when someone complimented my input. It made me feel valued and more confident.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic experience! It sounds like that compliment really boosted your confidence. How do you think you can build on that positive experience in future interactions?

User: I guess I could remind myself of that moment when I feel nervous in group settings. Maybe I could also focus on giving compliments to others, which might help me feel more connected.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Using positive self-talk can be very helpful. How comfortable do you feel about initiating conversations or engaging more actively in social activities moving forward?

User: I still feel a bit hesitant, but I want to try to push myself. I think I can set small goals, like starting a conversation with at least one new person at the next event.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is a wonderful approach! It helps build confidence gradually. How do you plan to reward yourself after you accomplish those goals?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to something nice, like a dessert or some time to do something I enjoy, like watching a movie.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward! It’s important to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you think engaging in these social activities will affect your feelings about yourself?

User: I hope it’ll make me feel more at ease with who I am and help me accept my body better, especially since I know my friends value me for who I am, not just my appearance.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Zhang! Recognizing that your worth comes from who you are as a person is key. How have your feelings about your body changed since you started interacting more with others?

User: I think I’m starting to be more accepting of my body. Being around supportive people has helped me see that it’s okay to be different.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! Acceptance takes time, but it’s encouraging to hear that you’re making progress. What other steps do you think might help reinforce this acceptance?

User: I could continue to remind myself of the positive feedback I receive and focus on self-compassion. Maybe even practice positive affirmations about my body.

Consultant: Practicing affirmations is a great idea! By reinforcing positive thoughts, we can counteract negative self-talk. Have you considered what specific affirmations might resonate with you?

User: I think something like "I am enough just as I am" or "I deserve to feel good about myself" would be fitting.

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Incorporating them into your daily routine could foster a more accepting mindset. How do you feel about discussing strategies to maintain these connections with your peers?

User: I’d like that! I think maintaining those connections is crucial for my growth. I want to ensure I don’t isolate myself again.

Consultant: Building and maintaining connections is essential! What activities or habits do you think could help you stay engaged with your peers?

User: Maybe I can suggest a regular study group or social hangout. Having something planned might keep the momentum going.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Planning regular interactions will help reinforce those relationships and keep the feeling of support alive. How do you feel about taking the lead in organizing these gatherings?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I really want to try. If I can get a few friends on board, it might not be so overwhelming.

Consultant: Starting with a small group is a great way to ease yourself into it! Remember, everyone is likely supportive of your willingness to bring people together. How do you envision feeling once you take that step?

User: I think it would feel empowering. If I can initiate it, I’ll feel more in control and like I really belong.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking control of your social interactions can create a sense of belonging and confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, what key takeaways or strategies will you focus on moving forward?

User: I’ll focus on positive self-talk, setting small social goals, and staying connected with my friends. I also want to keep practicing my affirmations.

Consultant: Those sound like solid strategies, Zhang! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I believe you’re on a wonderful path toward greater self-acceptance. If you ever feel the need for support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident and ready to keep working on these things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. It seems you're making progress with your self-acceptance and social interactions. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your body image and social relationships?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit more at ease with my body. I've been participating in more social events and have made some new friends, which feels great. But sometimes, I still catch myself being a bit critical of how I look.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you're actively engaging socially and forming new connections! It's normal to have those critical thoughts about our appearance from time to time. Can you share what specific thoughts occur when you feel critical about your body image?

User: I often think about how others might perceive me, especially when I'm with friends. I worry they notice my asymmetrical breasts and judge me for it. It makes me feel a bit insecure.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're feeling vulnerable about how you think others see you. What emotions do these thoughts bring up for you in those moments?

User: When I think that way, I usually feel anxious and a little embarrassed. It’s like I’m constantly second-guessing myself around others.

Consultant: I can understand how those feelings are quite heavy to carry in social situations. Let’s try to explore those thoughts a bit deeper. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports the idea that your friends are judging you based on your appearance?

User: Not really... Most of them are supportive and kind. I guess it’s more about my own worries than what they actually think.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Zhang. It's great that you have supportive friends. When you notice this thinking pattern, how about thinking of it as an overgeneralization? It might help to remind yourself of their positive support. How would you feel about challenging and reshaping those thoughts in those moments?

User: I think that could really help! If I could replace those thoughts with something more positive, it might ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! Instead of assuming judgment, you could affirm the kindness of your friends. Next time you find yourself thinking negatively about your body, could you remind yourself of their supportive actions or positive comments? 

User: Yes, I will try to do that! I feel like I need to focus on the good experiences rather than the negative thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging with your positive experiences will certainly help reinforce that self-acceptance. Have you had any positive experiences recently that you could reflect on when facing those critical thoughts?

User: Yes, just last week, we went out for dinner together, and we had a lot of fun. My friends made jokes, and I felt included and really happy!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Keeping those joyful moments in mind will serve as a powerful reminder of the connection you have with them. How do you think you can incorporate that into your thinking when you start feeling critical?

User: I can try to picture their smiles and remind myself of that fun night. It should help me feel more connected rather than anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualizing those happy moments can be incredibly grounding. Another aspect to consider is continuing to engage in social activities. Have you thought about any upcoming events where you can practice this new mindset?

User: Actually, there’s a gathering at a friend's house this weekend. I plan to go, and I think it would be a good opportunity to practice what we discussed.

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds like an excellent opportunity. Remember, the more you engage and remind yourself of those positive aspects, the stronger your confidence will become. How are you feeling about attending this gathering now?

User: I feel excited! I’m looking forward to it instead of feeling anxious, which is a great change for me.

Consultant: I'm very glad to hear that! You've made wonderful progress in shifting your mindset. It’s essential to acknowledge these changes. What will you take away from today’s session to reinforce your journey of self-acceptance and confidence moving forward?

User: I think I’ll focus on challenging my negative thoughts and remind myself of my friends' support. Also, I’ll actively try to enjoy the moments with them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Zhang! Acknowledging your friends’ support and actively embracing enjoyable experiences will definitely strengthen your self-acceptance. As we wrap up today, how confident do you feel about maintaining this positive mindset?

User: I feel more confident than before. I think I can really work on this and continue to grow.

Consultant: That’s inspiring to hear! Remember, it's a journey, and it’s great to see how far you’ve come. I believe in your ability to continue nurturing these positive thoughts and connections. If you ever feel the need to talk again, I’m here to help. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support and insights. I will keep working on this!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good. I received some praise during a campus event, and it really boosted my confidence. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident. Can you tell me more about how that experience affected your view of yourself and your interactions with others?

User: Sure! I felt really proud and appreciated. It made me realize that I can contribute positively, and it has helped me see myself in a better light.

Consultant: It's amazing to hear how external validation has positively influenced your self-image. What specific moments or thoughts from that experience stand out to you?

User: I remember feeling that all my hard work paid off. I felt like people valued my contributions, which is something I struggled with before. 

Consultant: It sounds like a significant shift in how you perceive your value in social settings. What do you think contributed to this change in your mindset?

User: I think it was the combination of putting myself out there and receiving recognition. In the past, I tended to doubt myself, but this time, I felt empowered.

Consultant: Empowerment is such a powerful feeling. How do you want to maintain this newfound confidence moving forward? 

User: I want to keep participating in activities that challenge me and build my confidence even more.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Engaging in activities can certainly strengthen your self-esteem. Are there any upcoming challenges or situations where you feel you might need additional support to maintain this confidence?

User: Well, next semester, we have to present a group project. I'm a bit anxious about that because public speaking has been a challenge for me in the past.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about public speaking, especially in a group setting. How might you prepare for that presentation to help ease your anxiety?

User: I could practice more often, maybe even in front of friends. Getting feedback could really help me feel more comfortable. 

Consultant: Practicing in front of friends is an excellent strategy! It can help you build confidence and receive constructive feedback. What else could you do to make yourself feel more at ease about this presentation?

User: I could visualize myself succeeding during the presentation, like imagining the audience being receptive and engaged. 

Consultant: Visualization is a powerful technique. It can help you set a positive expectation for how the presentation can go. When you're feeling anxious about it, what thoughts might arise, and how could you challenge those?

User: I usually think I might embarrass myself or forget what to say. I guess I could remind myself of past successes and focus on what I want to convey rather than the fear of failing.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Reminding yourself of past successes can indeed help ground you. In those moments of anxiety, how can you incorporate this positive self-talk?

User: I could write affirmations or positive messages to read before the presentation to remind myself of my capabilities.

Consultant: Affirmations are a wonderful tool! They can reinforce your positive self-image. How do you feel about creating a few of those together now?

User: I’d love that! I think starting with "I am well-prepared and capable" would be good. 

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! How about adding something like, “I am confident in my abilities and can engage my audience”? 

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! I’ll definitely use these when preparing for the presentation.

Consultant: Great! We’ve made some excellent progress today. As we wrap up, what are you most proud of regarding your journey in building confidence so far?

User: I’m proud that I’ve taken steps to participate more and embrace my strengths instead of hiding from them. 

Consultant: That's a significant achievement, Zhang! It shows tremendous growth. How will you continue to apply the strategies we discussed to ensure your confidence remains strong?

User: I’ll keep practicing, using affirmations, and reminding myself of my successes. I think that will help me a lot.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Remember, maintaining confidence is a continuous process. If you encounter any obstacles, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. You’ve done incredibly well, and I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and interactions. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel much more prepared to tackle my challenges now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. This concludes our sessions for now. Remember to reflect on your journey, and I’m sure you’ll continue to thrive. If you ever need anything in the future, feel free to come back. 

User: I will, thank you! I really enjoyed our sessions. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Zhang! Take care and best of luck with everything ahead!
