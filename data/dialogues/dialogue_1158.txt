Consultant: Hello Wenwen! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive into our conversation, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately regarding your studies and career. What’s been weighing on your mind?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really uncertain about my major and my future. I keep thinking about whether I should switch majors since I don’t even know what I’ll be able to do with my current one. I feel overwhelmed, especially since my parents are getting older and I don’t want to burden them. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure and uncertainty about both your studies and your family's situation. That's a heavy load to carry. Could you share more about the specific thoughts or concerns you have about your major?

User: I have no idea what my major is really about. I hear stories about what others are doing, and I’m afraid that I might not be good at it or that it won't lead to a secure job. I also worry about making money to help my family have a better future. It feels like I have to make all the right choices.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel pressured when you're thinking about your future and your family's well-being. It seems like there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding your major. What kind of emotions do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: I often feel anxious and sometimes frustrated. I compare myself to others, and I always feel like I'm falling short. I want to make my family proud and be successful, but I just don't know the right path to take.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Wenwen. It’s really important that you acknowledge those feelings of anxiety and frustration. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me what specific thoughts come to mind when you consider switching majors?

User: I think about finding something I’m truly passionate about, but then I wonder if that’s realistic. What if I switch and end up regretting it? It’s a scary thought.

Consultant: I can see how switching majors could feel daunting, especially with the fear of regret. Do you feel that your current thoughts about switching might be influenced by some extreme or negative beliefs about your own abilities or choices?

User: Yes, definitely! I sometimes think things like, "What if I'm not cut out for anything?" or "I’ll just end up disappointing my family." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging and negative. Let’s take a moment to examine them together. What evidence do you have that supports these beliefs? And are there any instances that contradict those thoughts?

User: I guess I do have a few times when I performed well academically in high school, but those thoughts seem to overshadow that. It feels like those were just lucky moments.

Consultant: It’s great that you mentioned those accomplishments in high school! They indicate that you are capable. Sometimes, our negative thoughts can cloud our perception of our abilities. If a friend was feeling the way you do, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has strengths and that it’s okay to explore. I’d remind them to celebrate their achievements, even if they seem small.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are empowering words. It's important to give yourself the same advice you would offer a friend. We can also explore your strengths and interests further together. How would that feel for you?

User: That sounds helpful! I just want to feel more sure about my choices and not so lost.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal. Let’s try to identify some of your interests and strengths to guide your decision-making. Would you be open to trying some assessments that might help you gain clarity on what you enjoy and where your skills lie?

User: Yes, I’d love that. I think understanding my interests could really help take some pressure off.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Moving forward, we can also set aside some time to discuss potential career paths related to your interests. By breaking down this uncertain feeling, we can work together to navigate your options. 

User: I appreciate that. I just hope I can get to a point where I feel like I’m on the right track.

Consultant: Absolutely, and remember that it's a journey. Taking small steps will help lead to greater clarity. Now, as we continue, it’s also helpful to focus on how to manage feelings of pressure when they arise. What do you currently do to cope with stress when it feels overwhelming?

User: I usually just try to distract myself with shows or music, but sometimes it doesn’t really help. 

Consultant: Distraction can be a temporary relief, but it’s good to develop coping strategies that address the underlying anxiety. We can explore some practical techniques together—for instance, grounding exercises or mindfulness practices. Would you be interested in that?

User: Yes, that sounds worth trying. I want to learn how to deal with stress better.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach. As we work together, we can incorporate those techniques into our sessions to see what resonates with you. For now, let’s reflect on how you might start integrating some small activities related to your interests. What ideas come to mind?

User: Maybe I could join a club related to my major or take an online class to learn something new? 

Consultant: Those are fabulous ideas! Engaging in activities that spark your interest could also help build your confidence. Let’s think about how you can start with one of those options before our next session. Would you be willing to set that as a goal?

User: Yes, I can definitely give that a try. I feel a bit lighter thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Wenwen! It’s encouraging to see you opening up to possibilities. As we wrap up for today, let’s summarize your progress. You've started to explore your thoughts around your major, acknowledged your feelings, and identified ways to better handle stress. 

User: Yes, and I feel slightly less anxious about the future. There’s still a little worry, but it’s manageable.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! It’s part of the process. Your willingness to explore and face these feelings is commendable. We can continue this journey together next time—keep in mind that it’s about gradual progress.

User: Thank you for today. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, I’m here to support you. I look forward to our next session where we can continue exploring your interests and thoughts. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hi Wuwen, I'm really glad you're here today. I know we've talked a bit about your feelings concerning your major and future career choices in our last session. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've felt a little bit better about my major, but I'm still very anxious about what I should do after graduation. The pressure of my family's expectations weighs heavily on me.

Consultant: I understand that the pressure from your family and the uncertainty about your future can be quite overwhelming. What specifically have you been anxious about lately? 

User: I keep thinking about whether I should change my major or stick with it. I really don’t know if it’s the right path for me. Plus, my parents have been working hard for me to be here at school, and I feel guilty about the burden I place on them.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re in a tough place, feeling the weight of your choices as well as the desire to alleviate some of that pressure from your family. Let's explore your feelings about your major a bit more. What specifically makes you question whether it's the right fit for you?

User: I just don’t see myself doing what my current major leads to as a career. I’ve been thinking of trying something different, but I also don't want to waste time or money if I end up regretting it.

Consultant: That makes sense. Exploring new options can be daunting because of the fear of making the wrong decision. Could you tell me more about the other courses you tried out? What did you like or dislike about them?

User: I took a course in graphic design, and I actually enjoyed it a lot! It felt different from my main studies, and I found the creative aspect really refreshing. But then I worry if that's a valid choice for a career.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you enjoyed the graphic design course! It's important to recognize what makes you feel engaged and excited. What aspects of that course do you think resonated with you? 

User: I liked the creativity involved, and the freedom to express myself through projects. But I also remember thinking that it's not a 'stable' career choice.

Consultant: Your appreciation for creativity is definitely something to take into consideration. Stability and fulfillment often go hand in hand when choosing a career path. Let's think about it this way: could you see yourself incorporating creativity into a more stable field? 

User: I hadn’t thought about that! I could maybe look into design roles in more traditional sectors, like marketing or branding.

Consultant: That's an interesting perspective! Combining your interests with more stable roles can open up new pathways for you. How do you feel about that possibility?

User: I feel a bit relieved actually, knowing there could be middle ground. But it still feels like a huge decision to make towards my future.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Major decisions can often feel overwhelming. Can we explore how you would approach making this decision in a way that feels manageable?

User: Sure! Maybe I could talk to professionals in those fields or even do an internship. That way, I could see what it’s really like before making a choice.

Consultant: That sounds like a very proactive approach! Speaking to professionals and gaining firsthand experience can provide invaluable clarity. Is there a particular job or role you have in mind?

User: Not really, I just want to learn more about options. I think talking to people in different fields for guidance would help me.

Consultant: Connecting with people in various careers is a great way to gather information. You can gain insights not only into the roles but also about their experiences and how they got where they are. Have you considered any methods for reaching out to such individuals?

User: I’ve thought about networking events or even reaching out on LinkedIn. However, I'm not sure how to start that conversation.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! You can begin by introducing yourself, sharing your current academic path, and expressing your interest in their field. Most people appreciate the chance to share their experiences. How does that sound to you?

User: That does sound doable. I think I could ask about their day-to-day work and what they enjoy most about their career!

Consultant: Exactly! It's all about engaging in genuine conversations. This not only aids in your exploration but can also boost your confidence in reaching out. How are you feeling about taking this next step?

User: I feel more motivated now. Having a direction to pursue is encouraging!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to take steps that feel right for you. Let’s also reflect on any feelings of pressure regarding your family and your sister’s situation—is that still weighing on your mind?

User: Yes, it is. I want to make sure my choices don’t add support issues for them, especially with my sister's struggles.

Consultant: It’s commendable that you care so much about your family. However, it’s essential to remember that your choices ultimately have to align with what feels right for you. In your journey, how can you balance your aspirations with your responsibilities to your family? 

User: I guess I need to remind myself that my happiness is important, too. If I find fulfillment in my career, I’d be in a better position to support them later.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Wuwen. Your well-being will contribute positively to your family as well. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today—how do you feel about your current understanding of your options and interests?

User: I feel I have a clearer understanding now! I can combine my creative interests with more stable career options, and I have a plan for outreach.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you’re thinking positively and exploring your options. How do you feel about our next steps moving forward?

User: I think I want to take some time to research potential career paths, speak with professionals, and see how I can apply for internships! 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, this is a journey, and taking it step by step will help alleviate some of the pressure. I'm proud of you for being proactive! 

User: Thank you! I feel more in control of my situation now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Wuwen! You’ve made great progress. If you have any more questions or need support, feel free to reach out. 

User: I definitely will! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Wenwen! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been exploring your current major and thinking about your future career. How are you feeling about it all?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I talked to some professors and seniors about my major and the job market, but I still feel this heavy pressure to choose the right path. I worry about my family’s support and my sister’s situation too.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility on your shoulders. Can you tell me more about the pressure you're feeling regarding your choice of major and your family's expectations?

User: Yeah, I just don’t feel certain that this major is right for me. I keep thinking about what job I can get after graduation, and I’m really worried that I won’t be able to find a good job to help my parents who are getting older.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, especially given your family’s situation. You mentioned feeling uncertain about your major. What do you think specifically makes you doubt whether it’s the right fit for you?

User: I’m not sure I even know what my major really entails. I read about it, but it still feels vague. I guess I’m also scared of making the wrong decision and regretting it later.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared about making such significant decisions, especially with so much at stake. Let’s focus on your feelings about this major. Can you recall any thoughts you've had when you think about what you want to do in the future?

User: I sometimes think about switching majors, but I also don’t want to disappoint my parents. I want to make them proud and help them enjoy life without financial stress.

Consultant: You clearly care deeply about your family's well-being, and that’s admirable. But it’s essential to find a balance between your aspirations and their expectations. What are some specific actions or steps you think you could take to explore this situation further?

User: I guess I could look into extracurricular activities or internships related to my major. But I’m not sure where to start or if I’ll even enjoy them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging in relevant activities can provide you with practical insights. How about we set a small goal for this week? Maybe identify one or two opportunities to explore, and afterward, we can discuss how you felt about them?

User: I think that sounds doable. I could reach out to a club related to my major. But I’m still anxious about whether I’ll fit in or how useful it will be.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel anxious about fitting in and the usefulness of the experience. What if we try to reframe those thoughts? Instead of focusing on fitting in, what if you viewed it as an opportunity to learn more about yourself and your interests?

User: That might help. If I focus on learning and not just on how I fit in, I guess it could be less intimidating.

Consultant: Exactly! Think about it as a journey of discovery. Engaging in those activities may not only clarify your interests but also provide you with connections that could be valuable later on. How does that perspective feel for you?

User: It feels kind of reassuring, actually. I could use it as a way to gather information rather than a test of my character.

Consultant: That’s a very constructive way to approach it! By viewing it this way, you’re giving yourself the freedom to explore without the pressure of immediate judgment. What else do you think you might gain from these experiences?

User: Maybe I’ll discover what I’m really passionate about. I wish I could just know if this major is right for me.

Consultant: It’s great that you're open to discovering your passions! Sometimes, engaging directly with the material or field can provide clarity. What if we consider setting some reflective questions for you to ask yourself after these activities? This could guide your exploration.

User: That sounds practical. What kind of questions should I think about?

Consultant: You could consider questions like: What did I enjoy most about this experience? Did it resonate with what I envision for my future? How do I feel while participating in these activities?

User: I like those questions. They seem like they can help me analyze my experiences better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Reflecting on your experiences can help deepen your self-understanding. As you explore these opportunities, remember that it’s okay not to have everything figured out right away. Progress takes time. 

User: Right, taking my time makes sense. I feel a bit more hopeful about figuring things out now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Wenwen! It's essential to hold on to that hope. As we continue our sessions, we can discuss your reflections and any new thoughts that emerge about your major and career choices. 

User: I appreciate it. I’ll work on reaching out to that club this week and see how it goes.

Consultant: Fantastic! I look forward to hearing about your experience. Remember, it’s perfectly alright to feel uncertain and to give yourself the grace to explore at your own pace. 

User: Thank you for your understanding. I feel less pressured now and more willing to explore. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! We’re making progress, Wenwen. Before we end today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re taking actionable steps to explore your major through activities and self-reflection questions. 

User: Yes, exactly. I feel more equipped to tackle this situation.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking those steps and shifting your perspective. It’s been a pleasure working with you today. If you feel uncertain again, remember the strategies we talked about. 

User: I will. Thanks for guiding me through this. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep believing in your ability to navigate through this uncertainty. I’m looking forward to our next session to discuss what you discover. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! I'm glad to see you for today's session. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding your major and future career paths. How has your week been since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about the career workshop I attended. It gave me some hope, but I'm still feeling unsure about what specific steps to take next in my studies and career.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the workshop inspired some hope in you! Can you share more about what aspects of the workshop stood out to you or resonated with you?

User: I liked how they talked about different roles in various fields and how to identify what suits me best. But I still feel lost trying to figure out which direction to go. 

Consultant: Feeling lost is completely understandable, especially when exploring new possibilities. Have you had a chance to reflect on any particular fields or roles that you're interested in after attending the workshop?

User: Yes, I found myself leaning towards marketing and psychology. I think the combination of both fields intrigues me, but I’m not sure if I’m good enough to pursue them.

Consultant: Combining marketing and psychology is an interesting choice! What qualities or skills do you think you possess that might make you suitable for these fields?

User: I think I’m creative and good at understanding people’s perspectives. But I often doubt if those skills can translate into a job.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some valuable qualities! Let's explore this a bit further. Can you think of a moment when you successfully used your creativity or understanding of others?

User: There was a project in a group assignment where I helped my team brainstorm ideas. It felt good to see everyone excited about the concepts I suggested!

Consultant: That's a fantastic example! Your ability to generate excitement and ideas shows a strong creative side, which is definitely a plus in both marketing and psychology. How did that experience make you feel about your abilities?

User: It made me feel a bit more confident about my creativity, but I still hesitate about whether it’s enough to build a career on.

Consultant: It's normal to feel hesitant, especially when contemplating future prospects. Let's think about this: what would a fulfilling career in either marketing or psychology look like for you?

User: I imagine a job where I can work with people, maybe develop strategies for engaging with them or understanding their needs. I want to make a difference somehow.

Consultant: That's a wonderful vision! Making a difference is a powerful motivator. How about we identify some short-term goals that could help you move towards this fulfilling career vision?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I need to learn more about these fields and maybe get some practical experience.

Consultant: Great idea! Exploring more about marketing and psychology can definitely help you clarify your interests. In what specific ways do you think you could gain this knowledge or experience?

User: I could look for internships, volunteer opportunities, or even take some online courses related to marketing or psychology.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Embracing internships or courses can give you valuable insights and real-world experience. How do you feel about taking practical steps towards these opportunities?

User: I feel excited but also a bit anxious about putting myself out there. What if I fail?

Consultant: It's totally natural to feel anxious about new experiences. Remember, every experience—whether it's a success or a learning opportunity—contributes to your growth. What's one small step you could take this week to start exploring those opportunities?

User: I could start by researching online courses that interest me, and maybe reach out to a couple of local businesses for internship possibilities.

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! Researching courses and reaching out for internships will give you practical insights and help you network. How confident do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel more confident now, especially knowing I have a plan. I just need to remind myself that it’s okay to take things one step at a time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking it down into smaller steps is a great way to manage any overwhelming feelings. Let's talk about how you can maintain this confidence as you move forward. 

User: I think setting small weekly goals could help me stay on track and feel accomplished as I progress.

Consultant: Setting weekly goals is an excellent strategy! They not only keep you motivated but also provide a sense of achievement. Would you like to outline a couple of these goals for the coming week?

User: Sure! I’ll research two online courses and send emails to three local businesses about internships.

Consultant: That sounds very attainable! By the end of the week, you’ll have a clearer view of your learning options and potential internships. How will you celebrate these accomplishments once you complete them?

User: I could treat myself to a nice dessert or have a little self-care evening! 

Consultant: Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, is very important. It reinforces your progress and motivation. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about our session and your plans moving forward?

User: I feel much more hopeful and excited about the future. I have concrete steps to take, which makes everything feel more achievable. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! You’ve made fantastic progress today. Remember, you have the ability to shape your future, and I believe you will find the right path. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance.

###################
Consultant: Hello Wenwen! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more positive. I've started taking those vocational training courses seriously. But I’m still unsure about my major and future career path.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been proactive about the training! You mentioned feeling unsure about your major. Can you share what specific thoughts or concerns you have about it?

User: I guess I just feel lost sometimes. I don’t really know what my major is about, and I worry if I’ll find a suitable job after graduation. Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty, which can be quite overwhelming. What do you think would help you feel more confident in your choice of major and future career?

User: If I could just understand more about what my major entails and what kind of jobs are available, that would help. I also want to make sure I'm not burdening my family with my decisions.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Understanding your major's relevance can certainly ease some of that burden. Have you had a chance to reflect on what aspects of the training you enjoy or excel at?

User: Yes, I've noticed I'm good at some of the skills we’re learning, especially in teamwork and problem-solving. But I’m still not sure how that translates to a job.

Consultant: Recognizing your strengths is a fantastic step! Teamwork and problem-solving are valuable skills in many fields. How do you think pursuing more training in these skills could align with potential career paths you might consider?

User: I think if I could combine these skills with something concrete, like project management or even in a creative field, I'd feel more secure about choosing a direction.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach! Project management, for instance, often involves strong teamwork and problem-solving skills. What steps do you think you could take to explore those options further?

User: Maybe I could look into internships or talk to professionals in those areas to get a better understanding of what the job involves.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Networking with professionals can give you valuable insights. Do you have someone in mind whom you could reach out to for advice?

User: I have a family friend who works in project management. I could ask her for coffee sometime.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Coffee is a casual way to connect. What questions do you think you might ask her to gain clarity on your potential career path?

User: I would want to know what her day-to-day looks like and how she got started in her career. I might also ask about the skills she finds most important.

Consultant: Those are insightful questions! They could provide you with realistic expectations and guidance. As you prepare for this meeting, how do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s a step towards understanding where I might fit in professionally.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! It's normal to feel a mix of emotions, especially when exploring new opportunities. How can you manage that nervousness before the meeting?

User: I could remind myself that it’s just a conversation. I can always ask questions and it’s okay to not know everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Viewing it as a conversation can alleviate some pressure. How do you think engaging in these conversations will impact your decision-making about the future?

User: I think it will help me clarify my thoughts. Hearing someone else's experience may motivate me to pursue what interests me more confidently.

Consultant: Definitely! Gaining a different perspective can enlighten your decision-making. Reflecting on your training, have you noticed any skills or interests that resonate with you in a way that might shape your career direction?

User: I realized that I enjoy creating solutions for challenges we face in the training exercises. It feels rewarding when I can help my team.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Your enjoyment in problem-solving could lead you towards roles that require creative thinking, possibly in fields like marketing or consulting. How does that resonate with you?

User: It actually feels promising! I never thought of those areas before.

Consultant: Wonderful! Exploring those options could open new avenues for you. As you think about this moving forward, what steps do you want to prioritize in your skill development?

User: I want to focus on enhancing my creative thinking skills and learning more about project management tools to see if they align with my interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting clear skill development goals will guide you as you navigate your professional journey. How do you feel knowing you have actionable steps to improve your future prospects?

User: I feel relieved! Having a plan makes everything seem less daunting.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Wenwen! It's all about taking small, manageable steps. How can we condense what you've learned today to ensure you feel confident moving forward?

User: I think I’ll summarize my learning goals and the questions I want to ask my family friend. Plus, I’ll remind myself that it’s all a process.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Reflecting on your goals will help reinforce your commitment. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your journey so far?

User: I feel optimistic and more reassured about my decisions. I really appreciate your help in clarifying my thoughts.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure working with you, Wenwen. Remember, you have the skills and drive to explore these new paths. If you ever feel the need for support again, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! It’s great to see you again. I’m looking forward to hearing about how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much more stable and less burdened mentally. I’ve been reflecting a lot on my future and what I want to do, and I feel more confident about my choices.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in understanding yourself and your future. Can you share more about the specific insights or feelings that have contributed to this newfound confidence?

User: Sure! I've been thinking about my major and career options and how I define my interests and strengths. I realized that I have a passion for helping others, which might guide my career choice.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Wenwen! Identifying your passion is a crucial step in finding a path that resonates with you. How do you feel this understanding of wanting to help others aligns with your current major?

User: I think it’s a bit conflicting. My major feels more technical and less personal. I'm not sure if I should pursue something that allows me to work directly with people.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel conflicted. It’s important to consider how much fulfillment and satisfaction you get from your studies. What aspects of your current major do you enjoy, and do you think there’s a way to integrate your passion with it?

User: I like the analytical part of my major, but I often wonder if it's truly what I want. I wish I could find a way to combine both interests.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective. Balancing analytical skills with a passion for helping others can open up various career options. Have you thought about fields that might combine those skills, like counseling or community service within a more analytical framework?

User: I have considered social work or counseling, but I worry about the financial stability of those careers. I want to ensure I can support my family, especially with my parents getting older.

Consultant: Financial security is a valid concern. Let’s explore this further. What would you need to feel comfortable and secure in pursuing a profession that aligns with both your passion and financial goals?

User: I think if I could see a clear career path and understand the earning potential better, I might feel more secure about transitioning.

Consultant: That makes sense. Researching potential career paths can provide valuable insights. Would you like to set some goals for exploring these options further and connecting them with what you have learned about yourself?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I’d like to look into different professions and maybe talk to professionals in those fields for firsthand experience.

Consultant: Great idea! Networking can provide you with clarity about various career paths. Let’s outline some action steps you can take. Do you already have someone in mind to reach out to, or would you like help finding connections?

User: I have a couple of family friends who work in healthcare and social services. I think I’ll reach out to them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! Engaging with those in the field can offer practical insights and help you gauge whether you want to pursue that direction. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel really excited! It feels good to have a tangible path to follow.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As a follow-up, how will you ensure that you maintain this positive outlook as you explore these new possibilities?

User: I think setting small, achievable goals each week will help. Plus, keeping a journal to document my thoughts and feelings throughout this process sounds beneficial.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Journaling can provide clarity and reflection. As we conclude this session, let’s review what we discussed and any strategies you plan to implement.

User: We talked about exploring potential careers that match my interests, reaching out to family friends, and setting goals while journaling my journey.
