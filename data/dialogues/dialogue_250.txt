Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm glad you're here for today's session. You've mentioned feeling misunderstood and angry recently. Can you share a bit more about what you've been experiencing with your family, especially in relation to your mother and your sister?

User: Hi. I just feel like my mom doesn't pay enough attention to me anymore, especially since my sister was born. It’s like I’m invisible, and I get really angry about it. Sometimes I hurt myself because I don’t know how to express what I feel.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoya. It seems like you feel a sense of neglect and frustration. It’s important to express those feelings in a healthy way. Can you tell me what specific events or moments make you feel ignored or misunderstood?

User: Well, when my sister was born, it felt like everything changed. My mom is always busy taking care of her, and I feel left out. I try to talk to her, but she doesn’t seem to listen. I just feel so alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite isolated in your emotions right now, especially with the changes in your family. What does that loneliness feel like for you when you're at home or with your mother?

User: It feels like no one cares about me. I want to talk to my mom, but she just brushes me off. I sometimes think if I hurt myself, maybe she will notice and care more.

Consultant: I hear how deeply hurt you are right now, Xiaoya. It's really painful to feel like you're not being noticed or valued. But there are healthier ways for your mother to recognize your feelings without turning to self-harm. Have you tried expressing your feelings directly to her? 

User: I haven’t really told her how I feel. I’m scared she won’t understand or just get angry. 

Consultant: That's a very understandable fear. It can be intimidating to open up, especially when you worry about the other person’s reaction. However, expressing how you feel could open up a dialogue. What if you started with something simple, like telling her that you miss spending time with her?

User: I could try that. But I’m worried she might still be too focused on my sister to really listen.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s okay to feel that way. Perhaps you could choose a moment when she seems less busy with your sister or suggest doing an activity together that you both enjoy. This could create a space for you to share your feelings in a more relaxed environment.

User: I like the idea of spending time together first. But what if she still doesn’t listen?

Consultant: If she doesn’t seem to listen, remember that it’s not a reflection of your worth. You can always express your feelings in writing if that feels safer for you. A letter can give you the chance to share your thoughts without the immediate fear of her reaction. What do you think about that?

User: Writing might work for me. At least I can get everything off my chest without feeling pressured.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Writing can be a powerful tool for self-expression. After you write to her, it might help to think about what you hope the outcome will be. How would you like her to respond?

User: I want her to understand how I feel, like I want her to know I’m still here and I need her. 

Consultant: That’s a very heartfelt desire, and it’s completely valid. You want to feel noticed and acknowledged. As you work on expressing your feelings, how could you also ensure your own emotional needs are met in your daily life, even if she’s busy?

User: I guess I could spend more time with my friends or find things that make me happy, like reading or drawing.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can be an excellent way to cope with feelings of loneliness and frustration. It can also help create a balance, making you feel more fulfilled. What small steps do you think you could take this week to get started on that?

User: Maybe I could schedule a time to hang out with my friends and also set some time aside to draw. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Xiaoya! Setting aside time for yourself and your friends is a step toward taking care of your emotional wellbeing. Let’s also brainstorm how you can express your feelings to your mother when you’re ready. What are some phrases or feelings you'd like to include when you talk or write to her?

User: I want to say that I feel lonely and that I miss her. I want her to know I’m still here and that I need her to pay attention to me.

Consultant: Those are powerful statements, Xiaoya. It’s important to let her know how her actions affect you. Would you feel comfortable role-playing a bit, where you practice expressing these feelings?

User: Sure, that might help. 

Consultant: Great! Imagine I’m your mom. Go ahead and express how you feel.

User: Mom, I feel really lonely lately since my sister was born. I miss spending time with you, and I really need you to notice me and how I feel.

Consultant: That was a strong start! How do you think she might respond to that?

User: I hope she would feel sorry and maybe understand.

Consultant: That’s a hopeful perspective! Remember, even if her initial reaction isn’t what you wish, you’ve taken a brave step. It’s about sharing your truth. As we wrap up today, what do you think the most important takeaway from our conversation is?

User: I think it’s that I can express how I feel without hurting myself. And I need to find ways to make myself happy too.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have valuable insights, and I believe in your ability to express your feelings and seek support. It’s also vital to care for yourself. Would you like to set some goals for our next session about these new strategies?

User: Yes, I want to work on writing that letter and making time for friends.

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan, Xiaoya! I'm here to support you in that journey. Remember, you’re not alone in this. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaoya! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really angry and lonely. I had a conflict with a classmate recently and now I feel isolated. I just don’t know how to reach out for support.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoya. It’s understandable to feel disappointed after conflicts with friends. Can you tell me more about what happened with your classmate?

User: Well, we had a disagreement during a group project, and it escalated. Now it feels like nobody wants to talk to me, and I really miss my friends. I just feel so alone.

Consultant: Feeling disconnected from friends can be quite painful. It seems like this situation has made you feel angry and isolated. How has this affected your schoolwork and daily life?

User: I’ve been struggling to focus on my studies since then. I keep thinking about the conflict and it distracts me. I feel like I'm falling behind and that makes me even more upset.

Consultant: It's common for conflicts to bleed into other areas of life, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. Apart from this particular situation, how do you usually express your feelings when you're upset or angry?

User: Honestly, I usually just keep it to myself. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems, but I know I shouldn’t just bottle it up.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaoya. It takes courage to acknowledge that you feel like you can't share your struggles. It's important to recognize those feelings and give yourself permission to express them. What do you think might happen if you tried to share your feelings with someone you trust?

User: I guess I’m afraid they won’t understand or they’ll think I’m overreacting. But I also think maybe it could help to talk about it.

Consultant: That fear of judgment is completely normal. However, sharing how you feel can often lead to support and solutions. Perhaps we could practice a few ways for you to express your feelings to your friends. Would you like to try some role-playing exercises today?

User: Sure, that sounds like it could help!

Consultant: Great! Let's create a scenario where you approach a friend and share your feelings. How would you like to start the conversation?

User: I think I’d want to say something like, “Hey, can we talk? I’ve been feeling really upset about our recent group project.”

Consultant: That's a good start! It’s direct and opens up the conversation. How do you think your friend might respond?

User: They might be surprised or maybe even awkward at first. I just hope they listen.

Consultant: Listening can sometimes take practice for people. If they respond awkwardly, what could you say next to help ease the conversation?

User: I could say, “I just want to share how I’ve been feeling; it’s been hard for me.” 

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a nice way to express your needs. It keeps the conversation gentle yet focused. How are you feeling about role-playing this with me?

User: Nervous, but I think it will be good practice. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous! Let’s take it slow. I’ll be your friend, and you can practice expressing yourself just like you would in real life.

User: Okay, here I go… "Hey, can we talk? I’ve been feeling really upset about our recent group project."

Consultant: “Oh, hey Xiaoya! Sure, what’s on your mind?”

User: “I feel like we didn’t communicate well, and it’s made me feel really isolated. I’m not sure how to fix things.” 

Consultant: “I didn’t realize you felt that way. I’m sorry if the project made you feel alone. What can we do to make it better?”

User: “Thanks for understanding! Maybe we could talk more next time we work together?”

Consultant: That was really well done! You clearly expressed your feelings and opened the door for solutions. What did you think of your performance?

User: I feel pretty good about it! I was nervous, but I think I got my point across.

Consultant: You did! Remember, the more you practice, the easier it becomes. As you continue expressing your feelings with your friends, it might help to also reflect on your reactions to your mother’s comments about your studies. 

User: Yeah, sometimes I feel like I can’t live up to her expectations. It’s really stressful.

Consultant: I understand that can be overwhelming. Let’s work together to adjust how you view her comments. If great expectations are weighing on you, how do you want to change that perception?

User: I want to see her feedback as something to improve rather than a criticism.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset shift, Xiaoya. It might help to think about how you can frame her comments in a way that feels empowering. Can we explore some ways to do that?

User: Sure! 

Consultant: Let's think about a time recently when she gave you feedback. How did it make you feel at the moment, and how could you re-frame that situation?

User: She said I needed to study harder, and I felt really defensive at that moment. I could say to myself that she wants me to succeed, instead of just feeling criticized. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By reframing her intentions as support for your success, you can ease the pressure and anxiety. What is one similar thought you could remind yourself of when you hear her comments in the future?

User: Maybe “She cares about my future.” That feels less harsh than “I’m failing.”

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful reminder! It’s important to be kind to yourself. You've made impressive progress in recognizing these thought patterns. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about how to manage my feelings now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoya! Remember that practice is key, both in communicating your feelings and in adjusting your perceptions. You’re capable of making these changes.

User: I will try practicing what we talked about. Thank you for your guidance today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm proud of the work you've done today. Remember, you can always return if you need more support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about my grades after the recent exams. I'm worried about how my mom is going to react. I feel like I've lost my confidence in studying.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of pressure regarding your grades and your mother's expectations. Can you share more about what specific thoughts you have when you think about her potential reaction?

User: I just imagine her being disappointed and criticizing me. I can almost hear her voice saying I didn't try hard enough, and that makes me feel worse about myself.

Consultant: That must be really tough for you. It's understandable that those thoughts make you anxious. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. Can you identify what feelings come up when you think about her criticism?

User: I feel really nervous and sad. Sometimes I wonder if I really am that disappointing. It just makes me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. I've noticed a connection between your thoughts about your performance and how you feel about yourself. What if we tried to look at those thoughts more closely? Are there any thoughts you have that might be extreme or negative?

User: Yeah, I guess when I think about failing, I often jump to the conclusion that I will never be good enough, or that my mom will think I’m a failure.

Consultant: I see. You've identified some really strong negative thoughts there. Let's question them a bit: What evidence do you have that not performing well in one exam means you’ll never be good enough? 

User: I don’t really have solid proof. I just feel like that based on one bad experience. It's hard to shake that feeling.

Consultant: It's understandable. But sometimes our feelings can lead us to believe things that aren't entirely true. If a friend of yours had a similar situation, what would you tell her?

User: I would probably say one bad grade doesn’t define her worth and that she can always improve. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you know deep down that one exam doesn't determine your value. What if you tried to remind yourself of this perspective when those harsh thoughts come up?

User: I could try that! Maybe writing it down somewhere might help me remember it.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing down positive affirmations can be a powerful reminder. Now, let’s think about some enjoyable activities you can engage in that also might help lift your mood. Have you thought about any hobbies or interests you might want to explore?

User: I used to love drawing and painting. I kind of stopped doing that because I felt I needed to focus on studying more.

Consultant: It sounds like drawing and painting brought you joy! What if we designed a small plan to integrate some creative time into your routine? This could help you not only relax but also regain some confidence.

User: I think starting with just an hour a week might help. 

Consultant: That sounds perfectly manageable! Let’s make that commitment to yourself. Also, how do you think spending some time doing what you love will impact your studies?

User: I think it will help me relax and maybe I’ll go back to studying feeling more inspired and less stressed.

Consultant: Definitely! Balancing study with personal interests can help reduce anxiety. You’ll be able to come back to your studies with a fresh mindset. How do you feel about this plan now?

User: I feel excited! I haven’t thought about doing something I enjoy in a while. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s all about nurturing that part of you. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize: You’ll work on affirmations to challenge those negative thoughts and dedicate time to drawing. What do you think about that?

User: Yes! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: I'm glad you're feeling positive! Remember, it’s okay to face obstacles, but you've got the skills to handle them. As we continue this journey, keep practicing those strategies, and don’t hesitate to share any feelings that come up along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoya! I’m here to support you, and I’m looking forward to seeing your progress in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoya! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like I’ve been doing better, especially after that art event where I got some praise. It made me feel good about myself.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that receiving praise has boosted your confidence. Can you share more about how that recognition affected you?

User: It made me realize that I can be good at something. I’ve started thinking that maybe I could explore art more seriously.

Consultant: Exploring art further sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities that interest you is a great way to improve your mood. What specific art activities have you been considering?

User: I’m thinking about taking a painting class or maybe joining a local art club. I just want to create more.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Painting classes or joining an art club can provide you with both skills and a supportive community. How do you think these activities might help you not just with art, but in other areas of your life?

User: I think it could help me feel more relaxed and maybe express what I’m feeling inside better. Sometimes I can’t talk to my mom about my feelings.

Consultant: I understand that communicating with your mom can be challenging. Expressing yourself through art might also help build your confidence in having those conversations with her. Have you thought about ways to start that dialogue with her?

User: I haven’t really. I just don’t know how to bring it up without it being awkward.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. How about we brainstorm some simple ways to introduce the topic? Perhaps you could share your excitement about your art or even show her what you create?

User: That sounds like a good plan! Maybe I can show her some sketches or paintings and explain what I enjoy about them.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Sharing your art could open up a conversation about your feelings and interests. How do you feel about actually doing that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it could help her understand me better.

Consultant: Nervousness is natural, but it sounds like your excitement is stronger. It’s a step towards reconnecting with her. What other strategies could you use to feel more comfortable when communicating with her?

User: I could maybe write down what I want to say first. That way I won’t forget anything and can express myself better.

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts is a fantastic strategy! It can help clarify your feelings and reduce anxiety during the conversation. Would you like to practice how you might start that conversation?

User: Sure! I think I could say something like, “I really enjoyed this art class and it means a lot to me. I want to share that with you.”

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to start! It’s straightforward and opens up the opportunity for discussion. How does practicing these conversations make you feel about communicating with your mom?

User: It makes me feel more prepared, like I actually have a chance to connect with her.

Consultant: Feeling prepared is a big step! Remember, the goal is to strengthen your relationship with her through open dialogue. After your conversation, how would you like to celebrate your effort, regardless of the outcome?

User: I think I’d treat myself to some new art supplies. That would be nice!

Consultant: Treating yourself sounds like a wonderful idea! It’s important to reward yourself for your efforts. Moving forward, how will you keep nurturing your interest in art while working on this relationship?

User: I’ll keep attending the classes and show my art to my mom when I feel ready. I also want to keep improving my skills.

Consultant: That’s a lovely plan, Xiaoya! Your dedication to both your art and your relationship with your mom will surely lead to growth on both fronts. What do you think will be your biggest challenge in sticking to this plan?

User: I think it might be feeling too shy to share my art. I worry about her judgment.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel shy, especially about sharing something personal. Let’s remind ourselves that art is subjective, and your feelings are valid. How might you cope with any judgment you perceive from her?

User: I could remind myself that I’m doing this for me, and that art is about personal expression.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your personal expression is key. You’re creating for yourself first and foremost. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we’ve discussed for enhancing both your art pursuits and your communication with your mom?

User: I feel good about it! I have a clearer idea of what to do next and I’m excited to start.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. I’ll be here to support you whenever you need to talk. How about we set a goal for your next session regarding your conversation with your mom and your art practice?

User: Yes, I’ll aim to show her one of my pieces and share my feelings about the art classes by then.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal, Xiaoya! I believe in your ability to do this, and I’m excited to hear about your progress next time. Always feel free to bring up anything that comes to mind before our next session. 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and remember to enjoy your artistic journey. Until next time!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your communication with your mother?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I've managed to express myself better to my mom. It's still a bit challenging, but I feel like our relationship is improving.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant progress in expressing your feelings. Could you share an example of a recent conversation that went well?

User: Sure! The other day, I told her how I felt about some things that were bothering me. I was surprised that she actually listened and responded positively. It made me happy.

Consultant: It's great that you experienced positive engagement with her. How did that make you feel about your ability to communicate?

User: It made me feel more confident. I think I can talk to her about more things now. I feel like she cares, which is nice.

Consultant: That sense of care can really strengthen your bond. Let's explore this a bit further. What specific feelings did you experience when she responded positively?

User: I felt relieved and hopeful. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I didn’t expect her to be so receptive.

Consultant: Those feelings of relief and hope are incredibly important. They signify a breakthrough in your relationship. Have there been any challenges in communicating that you still want to address?

User: Sometimes I worry that I might say something wrong or that she might not understand me. I guess I still have that fear.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel apprehensive about communication, especially when relationships are developing. Can you think of any specific situations where that fear comes into play?

User: Well, there are times when I want to bring up certain topics, like school stress, but I hold back. I’m afraid it’ll turn into a confrontation.

Consultant: Acknowledging that fear is a good step. What do you think might happen if you did bring up those topics? How might your mom respond?

User: I think she might surprise me like before, but I don’t know for sure. Part of me thinks she might dismiss my feelings.

Consultant: That uncertainty can be daunting. Let’s challenge this thought. What evidence do we have that suggests she would dismiss your feelings this time, especially after your recent positive interactions?

User: Well, I guess I don't have solid evidence. I just remember past conversations where she seemed distracted or uninterested. But maybe I’m just anticipating the worst.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re aware of a cognitive distortion there. Sometimes our past experiences can influence our current expectations. If a friend told you they were nervous about similar situations, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it a try and see what happens. I’d remind them that people can change too.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Recognizing that people can change can help ease your worries. Perhaps you can approach future conversations with an open mind, just like you would encourage a friend to do. How does that resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I should remind myself that things can be different now, especially since we’ve been working on our relationship.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s also think about some strategies you could use to ease into those conversations. What are some ways you could prepare for when you want to discuss something important?

User: I could write down my thoughts in advance. And maybe practice what I want to say out loud first.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing out loud can help you feel more comfortable. Additionally, you could also find a good time when she seems relaxed. Does that sound like a plan?

User: Yes, I think so! I’ll definitely try that. 

Consultant: Great! We can also explore how to respond if she doesn’t understand you right away. How do you think you could express yourself further if that happens?

User: Maybe I could ask her if she understands what I meant and clarify things if she seems confused.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach! Asking for clarification can help deepen understanding between you. Let’s summarize your goals moving forward: You want to continue improving communication with your mother, address your fear of difficult topics, and practice stating your thoughts clearly. 

User: Yes, that’s exactly it!

Consultant: As we wrap up, remember how far you've come already. You’ve gained a sense of confidence in your conversations. What are some feelings or thoughts you want to carry with you after today’s session?

User: I feel motivated to keep improving my communication. I want to feel more connected and understood in my family.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Xiaoya! Carry that motivation with you. It’s been great working together, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you’re doing an amazing job!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I’ll work on these things.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I'm getting better at managing my feelings and dealing with stuff at school.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress. Can you share a bit more about what specific changes you've noticed in yourself?

User: Well, I feel calmer when I’m studying, and I don't get as stressed out during tests. I think I'm learning to take breaks and not push myself too hard.

Consultant: That’s a really positive strategy! Taking breaks can help prevent burnout. What do those breaks look like for you? 

User: I usually step outside for a bit or do some quick exercises. Sometimes I just listen to music for a while.

Consultant: Those sound like great activities to help recharge. It’s essential to do what feels good for you. How has your family been during this time? Have they noticed your improvements?

User: They have! My mom said she noticed I'm less grumpy and more focused these days. It feels nice to hear that.

Consultant: That’s great validation from your mom! It must feel rewarding to have her notice your efforts. What about your friends? Have you been able to connect with them more?

User: Yes, definitely! I’ve been hanging out with them more often, and I feel more confident talking to them. We sometimes study together, which helps.

Consultant: Social connections are so important, especially at your age. It’s fantastic to hear you’re enjoying that. Are there specific goals or areas you want to focus on moving forward?

User: I think I want to keep improving my study habits and maybe try to be more involved in class discussions. I sometimes get nervous about speaking up.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Xiaoya. Getting involved in class discussions can really boost your confidence. How do you feel about practicing that?

User: I’m a little scared but excited too. I really want to try!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about speaking up. What if we brainstorm some strategies together to help you ease into participating more in class? 

User: Yes, that sounds good. I could try preparing a few points before class, so I feel more ready.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Preparing ahead of time can build your confidence. How about setting a small goal for yourself to share something in the next class?

User: I think that would be a good challenge for me. I’ll try to share at least one thing!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment! Remember, it's okay to take small steps. What’s another way you could get involved, maybe outside of class?

User: I could join a club or something. That might help me meet new friends and practice talking more.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a wonderful idea! It can also provide a supportive environment to express yourself. Do you have any particular clubs in mind?

User: I'm thinking about the art club. I love drawing and painting, and it could be fun!

Consultant: The art club sounds like a perfect fit for you! Not only will you enjoy it, but it could also help you connect with people who share your interests. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited about it! I just need to gather the courage to go to the first meeting.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel a bit nervous before trying something new. What strategies do you think you can use to overcome that initial fear?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone else there is probably nervous too. And I can just focus on having fun!

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Focusing on enjoyment can really alleviate pressure. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it's about being brave and taking small steps to try new things. I feel more motivated now!

Consultant: That’s a beautiful takeaway, Xiaoya! Remember that growth comes from those small steps. You’ve made wonderful progress, and I believe you can keep it going. How do you want to approach our next session?

User: I want to share how the art club goes and my experience speaking up in class!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, I’m here to help you along the way. Thanks for being so open today.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
