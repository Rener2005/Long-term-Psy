Consultant: Hello, Lili. I'm glad you're here for today's session. I know things have been challenging for you lately. Can you start by sharing how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite isolated and overwhelmed. The fight with that boy in class has really affected me, and now there are rumors. I just don't want to go to school or talk to anyone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and sadness from this situation. Can you tell me more about how these rumors are impacting your thoughts and feelings about school?

User: I feel like everyone’s judging me. I used to enjoy school, but now I dread going. It feels like I can't escape the gossip. I wonder if I’ll ever be able to face my classmates again.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Lili. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you think people are judging you. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you consider going back to school?

User: I keep thinking that everyone must think I'm a bad person for what happened. It's like these thoughts won't leave my head, and they just make me feel worse.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would weigh heavily on you. Have you noticed if these thoughts affect how you feel about yourself or how you interact with others at school?

User: Yes, they make me feel like I'm not good enough and that I can't talk to anyone. I've even avoided my friends because I’m afraid they'll believe the rumors, too.

Consultant: It seems like this situation is making you feel disconnected not only from your classmates but also from your friends. Let’s take a moment to identify these thoughts. Do you think those thoughts about not being good enough are entirely accurate?

User: I guess not. I know I usually do well in school, and my friends used to like hanging out with me.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It sounds like there’s evidence that counters the negative thoughts you have about yourself. If you were to reframe that thinking, what might you tell yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could think that everyone makes mistakes, and I still have my good qualities. I just need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering your strengths can help shift your perspective. What qualities do you think your friends appreciate in you that you can focus on?

User: They always say I’m fun and understanding. I really try to be a good friend.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Lili! Let's think about how you can reach out to your friends and share your thoughts. How might you approach communicating with them about the situation?

User: I think I could tell them what happened and how I feel. I hope they would understand and not believe the rumors.

Consultant: That's a commendable approach! Being honest with your friends can help them see things from your perspective. What steps could you take to start that conversation?

User: Maybe I could invite a close friend to talk after class. It might be less intimidating that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Inviting a close friend can create a safe space for you to share your feelings. How do you think you'll feel after talking to them?

User: I hope I’ll feel relieved and maybe a little less alone.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Feeling understood is important, and it can help alleviate some of that burden. If they react positively, what difference do you think that would make for you?

User: It would probably give me more courage to talk to other classmates. I just hope they don’t judge me too harshly.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but remember that you are not defined by this incident. What could you say to yourself to help bolster your confidence as you navigate these interactions?

User: I could tell myself that it’s just one situation and that I am a good person overall, regardless of what happened.

Consultant: I love that affirmation! It’s a healthy reminder of your worth. Beyond these conversations, are there any activities you find comforting that you can engage in to help with your feelings?

User: I enjoy drawing and reading. They help me relax when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent coping strategies! Engaging in activities you love can provide you with a sense of peace. How about incorporating more of those into your routine as you face these challenges?

User: Yes, I could definitely set aside time for drawing each day. It might help take my mind off things.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Lili. Creative outlets can be very therapeutic. As we wrap up today’s session, what have you learned about yourself and your situation that feels important to take forward?

User: I realize that I can talk to my friends about how I feel and that I shouldn’t let the rumors define me. I have support and I can lean on it.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway! Remember, you're not alone in this, and reaching out for support can make a significant difference. If you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to use the coping strategies we discussed. I'm looking forward to seeing how things evolve for you next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful after our talk today. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Lili. Keep nurturing that hope, and we’ll work together on strengthening your confidence and connections. Until next time!

Consultant: Hello Lili! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really heavy and overwhelmed. My classmates don’t seem to understand me, and my mom is really worried after the parents' meeting at school. It makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight right now, especially with your mom's concerns and your classmates' misunderstandings. Can you share more about what specifically has been bothering you regarding your classmates?

User: I feel like they don't accept me. Sometimes they laugh at me for being different and it's really painful. I just want to fit in, but I don't know how.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to fit in, especially at your age. When you say they laugh at you, what thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I think maybe there’s something wrong with me. If they laugh at me, I must be doing something bad. It just makes me want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing there's something wrong with you when others react negatively. Could we explore the evidence behind those thoughts? For instance, is there any proof that there’s something genuinely wrong with you?

User: I don’t know… I just feel that way because of their reactions. But maybe I’m just different, not wrong.

Consultant: That’s an interesting perspective! You’re recognizing that being different doesn't mean there’s something wrong with you. When you think of yourself as just different, how does that change how you feel?

User: It feels a bit better. But I still worry about my mom’s worries. She says she’s anxious about my social life and my grades.

Consultant: Your mom's worries are a lot to carry along with your own. It seems like you are feeling pressured both by your classmates and your mom’s expectations. What could be a more balanced view of your situation regarding your grades and social life?

User: I guess my grades are still good, and I can work on making friends slowly. I shouldn't feel like I need to change overnight.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Allowing yourself the space to slowly build friendships sounds much more manageable. What small steps do you think you could take to start feeling more connected with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could try talking to one person at a time, like during lunch. Just small conversations.

Consultant: I think that's a solid plan! Engaging in small conversations can make a big difference over time. How do you feel about trying that gradually?

User: I feel like I could do that. It seems less daunting than I thought.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Lili! Gradual steps can help ease the pressure. As you prepare for those conversations, what kind of thoughts could you remind yourself of to stay calm and confident?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be myself and that most people are just friendly. I shouldn’t be too hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation to hold onto! Being kind to yourself is so important. Do you think you could practice that thought before your next social encounter?

User: Yes, I will try to remember that and take deep breaths to calm down if I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be incredibly helpful. Let’s think about how you can practice those deep breaths regularly—would setting aside a few minutes each day work for you?

User: Yes, I can do that! It sounds simple enough to manage.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Lili! Building these small habits can support you when you face stress. How do you feel right now about managing the pressure from your classmates and your mom?

User: I feel a bit lighter. At least now I have some strategies to think about, instead of just feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! It’s really important to recognize your progress. What’s one thing you’re taking away from our talk today that you feel excited to implement?

User: I’m excited to try talking to classmates and just being myself. I think it will help a lot.

Consultant: I believe it will! Keep in mind that you are not alone in this, and it’s okay to take one step at a time. In our next session, we can discuss how those conversations went. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll definitely try my best.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences, Lili. Just take it one day at a time. Remember that you are strong, and you are making progress. If you ever feel overwhelmed before our next meeting, feel free to practice those breathing techniques. 

User: I will! Thank you for understanding and helping me today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lili. It was a pleasure talking with you. Remember, you are capable of navigating through this, and I’m here whenever you need support. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Lili! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling tired because of school and some criticism from my teacher. During class, I got called out for daydreaming, and it made me feel really bad.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable that being criticized can affect how you feel about school. How did you handle that situation when the teacher pointed it out?

User: I felt embarrassed and just wanted to disappear. I’ve been trying hard to focus, but sometimes my mind just wanders off.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed is a common reaction to being called out. It might also contribute to your overall feelings of fatigue. Let’s explore that a bit more. What do you think causes your mind to wander during class?

User: I think I just feel stressed about everything—schoolwork, my family situation, and trying to keep up with my friends. It’s all too much sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, Lili. Balancing school, family, and friendships can feel overwhelming. In your opinion, which of these concerns weighs the heaviest on you right now?

User: I guess school is the biggest source of stress for me. I really want to do well, but sometimes I just can’t seem to concentrate, especially after what the teacher said.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s important to acknowledge what’s bothering you. Let’s focus on your concentration challenges. When you find it hard to concentrate, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think, "I’m going to fail," or "Everyone is better than me." Those thoughts really make me anxious about studying.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts can really drain your motivation. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports those feelings of failure or feeling less than others?

User: I know I usually do well in school, but when I mess up, it makes me feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s understandable—mistakes can feel really heavy. But it’s also worth considering that everyone makes mistakes. If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them to think about their mistakes?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to mess up and that one mistake doesn’t define who they are.

Consultant: Exactly! You can extend that same kindness to yourself. How about we work on some strategies for identifying those negative thoughts when they arise? This way, you can start reframing them.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I want to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, self-compassion is crucial. Let’s start with some simple exercises to practice this. Have you tried setting small goals for yourself? It might help steer your focus back to your studies.

User: I haven’t really thought about it. What kind of small goals do you mean?

Consultant: Small goals could be things like studying for just 20 minutes at a time or taking a short break after finishing a math problem. These can make it less overwhelming and help improve your focus.

User: I like that idea! I think starting small would make it easier for me.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Let’s also consider taking breaks to unwind when you start to feel stressed. What activities help you feel more relaxed?

User: I like drawing and listening to music. Those usually help me feel better.

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating your interests into your study routine could help you recharge. Maybe you could draw for a few minutes after completing a study session? 

User: I would love that! It sounds like a good way to break up my study time.

Consultant: I’m glad you agree! Let’s make a plan that includes these small goals and relaxation practices. How does that sound?

User: Sounds great! I really want to try this.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can also keep track of your progress. Each time you achieve one of your small goals, recognize that it’s a step forward. How does this idea resonate with you?

User: I think that would motivate me to keep going. At least I’ll feel like I’m making progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating your small wins is just as important as hitting larger goals. Now, as we wrap up, can you share how you’re feeling about the strategies we've discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think I can manage my stress better now and improve my focus with these tips.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’re taking a positive step towards managing your stress and finding more joy in your studies. Remember, progress may be gradual, but every little step counts.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more confident about moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lili! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Whenever you feel ready, you can give yourself permission to come back and share how things are going. Take care!

User: I will! Thank you again for everything!

Consultant: Hello Lili! I’m glad to see you for our session today. I want to start by checking in with you—how have you been feeling since our last discussion about your social experiences?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little more confident since I joined the class activities. It was nice to talk to some of my classmates, but I still get nervous sometimes.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’ve been feeling more confident! Social activities can really help us feel connected. Can you share what specific moments during the activities made you feel good?

User: Well, during a game we played, I found it fun to laugh with my classmates. It was the first time I felt like I belonged a bit. But, before the game, I was really anxious about talking to them.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a wonderful experience during the game, and I can understand why you felt nervous beforehand. Can you tell me more about what thoughts you had when you were feeling anxious before the game?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself or that no one would want to talk to me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It’s interesting how our minds sometimes predict the worst. How did you feel when you realized your classmates were enjoying the game and talking with you?

User: I felt relieved and happy! It was nice to see that we were all having fun together, and I realized that it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! You managed to move past your initial fears. Let’s think about those anxious thoughts you had. If you were to challenge those thoughts, what alternative perspectives could you consider when you feel nervous about social situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone else is probably feeling a bit nervous too, and that it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering that everyone has their own nerves can really ease the pressure. How do you think practicing this perspective might change your experience in future social situations?

User: I think it might make me feel more relaxed, and I could enjoy myself more instead of worrying so much.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Relaxation can lead to more enjoyable interactions. Let’s practice that perspective together. Can you imagine a situation where you feel nervous, and instead, think of a positive thought to replace your anxious one?

User: Sure! If I was about to join another group activity, I could tell myself that it’s a chance to make new friends and have fun.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s an excellent thought to hold onto. Moving forward, let’s think about potential opportunities for you to engage with others. What kinds of activities would you like to join that might help you connect with more classmates?

User: I’ve been thinking about trying out for the school play or joining the book club. I enjoy acting and reading.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful options! Both activities provide great opportunities to meet new people. How do you feel about stepping out of your comfort zone to try one of these activities?

User: I feel a bit scared, but also excited! I think I’d like to try the book club first.

Consultant: That’s a great choice, Lili! It’s okay to feel a little scared; excitement can often accompany new experiences. What can you do to prepare yourself for your first meeting?

User: Maybe I can read the first book they choose and think of some questions to ask. That way, I’ll feel more ready to participate.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Preparing ahead of time can boost your confidence. As you get ready for the club, remember to remind yourself of the positive thoughts we discussed. How do you feel about your plans moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try. I really want to make new friends and be more involved.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building friendships takes time and effort, and you’re already making wonderful progress. Let’s set a small goal for your next session. Maybe we can focus on how your first book club meeting goes. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, that sounds great! I’m excited to share how it went.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences! Remember, each step you take is a part of building your social skills. You’re doing an amazing job, Lili. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! I’m here to support you. Just remember, you have the strength to explore new friendships, and I believe in your ability to connect with others. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lili! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling about your friendships lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really excited. I’ve made some friends in school and had a great conversation with some girls from the next class. It felt nice to share and connect.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Building new friendships can be really fulfilling. What aspects of these new friendships are you enjoying the most?

User: I love how easy it is to talk to them. We laugh together and share stories. It feels nice to have that connection. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re developing a sense of belonging, which is so important. Is there anything that has made you feel uncertain or worried about these new friendships?

User: Sometimes, I worry about saying the wrong thing or if they’ll still want to be friends with me after knowing me more.

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common when forming new friendships. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt uncertain or anxious about saying the wrong thing?

User: There was this one time I joked about something, but I wasn’t sure if they took it the right way. I felt a little awkward after that.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. How do you think that experience impacted your thoughts about your friendship with them?

User: I started to think maybe I should just be quiet and not say too much. I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable.

Consultant: I see that you’re being cautious, which makes sense. But keeping quiet can also make it harder to connect. What do you think you could do differently to express yourself while still feeling comfortable?

User: Maybe I could try to share slightly more about myself, like my interests or things I like. It might help me feel connected.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing your interests can help strengthen your bond. Are there any particular interests you’re excited to share?

User: I love reading and playing some games. I think if I talk about those, they might relate to me better.

Consultant: That sounds great! Sharing your passions can also invite them to share theirs. Have you thought about how you might bring those topics into your conversations?

User: I guess I could casually mention a book I’ve read or ask them about games they like. That might work!

Consultant: Absolutely! Casual mentions can open up the conversation naturally. As you think about these interactions, what might you do if you sense a misunderstanding or conflict in your friendship?

User: If there’s a misunderstanding, I suppose I could ask them directly about it. I usually avoid confrontation, though.

Consultant: It’s good that you recognize that. Direct communication can sometimes help clear the air. What would help you feel more comfortable addressing a possible misunderstanding?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that it’s okay to talk about things openly. I want to be brave enough to express my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Confirming that it’s okay to communicate feelings is crucial. Do you feel prepared to practice this mindset in your interactions?

User: I think I am! I just need to remember that friendships can involve misunderstandings, and that it’s part of getting to know each other better.

Consultant: Exactly! And it’s great that you’re committing to being open about your feelings. What do you think would be your next step in nurturing these friendships?

User: I’d like to start sharing more about myself and also be open if something feels off between us. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. How do you feel about taking these steps? 

User: I feel excited! I think I’ll be able to connect with them more deeply.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As you move forward, it’s also important to reflect on your experiences. What would you like to remember from our session today?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to be myself and that it’s possible to talk things out if there’s a problem. 

Consultant: Those are key takeaways! Remember, every experience helps you grow. As we wrap up today, how would you rate your confidence in navigating friendships now?

User: I’d say I feel a lot more confident, maybe around 8 out of 10! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Lili! It’s wonderful to see your growth in confidence. Before we end, what are your thoughts on continuing to build these skills moving ahead?

User: I think I’d like to keep practicing and maybe come back if I feel stuck or need advice again.

Consultant: Of course! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. You've made significant strides, and I believe in your ability to handle challenges in friendships. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you have the tools to build strong connections. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello Lili! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, actually. I've been participating actively in group work and my classmates seem to enjoy working with me. The teacher also gave me positive feedback, which made me really happy!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've built some strong connections with your classmates. How does this make you feel about your social skills and your performance in school?

User: I feel proud of myself. It’s nice to know that my efforts are recognized by both my peers and my teacher. It encourages me to keep trying.

Consultant: You should definitely be proud! Acknowledging your progress can really help boost your self-esteem. Is there anything specific you’ve noticed about how you handle yourself in these social situations?

User: I’ve become more confident in sharing my ideas during group discussions. Before, I used to be shy and worry about what others would think, but now I’m more willing to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a significant change, Lili! It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more confident. How do you think this newfound confidence will help you in your future interactions and studies?

User: I think it will help me participate more in class and maybe even take on more leadership roles in projects. I feel like I can voice my opinions without fear.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing leadership opportunities can be a fantastic way to continue your growth. Are there any specific goals you have in mind for yourself concerning your interactions or studies moving forward?

User: I’d like to improve my ability to help my classmates when they don’t understand something. I want to be the one they can rely on.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Lili! Being a support for your peers not only helps them but also reinforces your own understanding. Have you had any opportunities to help someone recently?

User: Yes, actually! Last week, I helped a friend who was really stressed about a math assignment. I explained a few concepts, and she said it really helped her.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re already making strides in that direction. How did that experience make you feel about yourself?

User: It felt really rewarding. I was happy to see her understand better because of my help. It made me realize I have something valuable to offer.

Consultant: It definitely sounds like you do! Keeping that in mind will be very beneficial as you continue to develop your skills. Are there any challenges you foresee in maintaining or building upon this confidence and support for others?

User: Sometimes, I worry that I might not be able to explain things clearly or that I might frustrate my classmates if they don’t get it right away.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Lili. It’s important to remember that everyone learns at their own pace. We can work on some techniques to help you communicate more effectively. Would you like to explore some strategies together?

User: Yes, I’d really like that. I want to make sure I’m being as helpful as possible.

Consultant: Great! One strategy is to ask questions that encourage your classmates to think through the problems themselves, rather than just giving them the answer right away. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think it might help them feel more confident too, which is what I want.

Consultant: Exactly! Asking guiding questions can empower them and also reinforce your own understanding. We can also practice some of these approaches together. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel excited! I want to try it out and see how it goes.

Consultant: Awesome! Practicing your skills can not only benefit your classmates but also strengthen your confidence even more. Would you like to set a few action steps for the next week to work on?

User: Sure! I think I can reach out to a classmate who seems to struggle and offer my help. I can also try using more questions when explaining things.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps, Lili! It’s clear you’re committed to helping others while also enhancing your own skills. How will you keep track of your progress?

User: I could write down my experiences in a journal after each time I help someone. That way, I can see what worked and what I could improve.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful way to reflect! Journaling can help you recognize your growth over time. How do you feel about this plan overall?

User: I feel good about it! I think it’ll help me stay focused on my goals.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It seems like you’re on a great path. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve discussed and set up our next meeting.

User: Sure! We talked about my progress in social skills, my goal to help classmates, and the strategies I can use, like asking questions. I’ll journal my experiences too.

Consultant: Exactly, Lili! You’ve done a fantastic job articulating your thoughts today. I believe you have all the tools to continue progressing. Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs along the way.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and encouragement.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Lili! I’m so proud of the steps you’re taking. If at any point you feel uncertain, just remember to reach out. Our next session will be a great opportunity to check in on your progress.

User: I’ll definitely do that! I’m looking forward to it.
