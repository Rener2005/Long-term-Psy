Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really stressed and disappointed. My work situation with my boss is quite difficult, and it just seems like everything is going wrong.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about what happened with your boss recently?

User: Well, I had a disagreement with my boss, and ever since then, it feels like she’s been making things even harder for me at work. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Disagreements can sometimes lead to more tension and stress in the workplace. How has this situation affected your feelings about work and your daily life?

User: I've lost a lot of motivation. I used to enjoy my work, but now I dread going to the office. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when you're facing such challenges. Let’s explore this a little deeper. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about going to work?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough, and that my efforts don’t really matter. I just feel like I'm disappointing everyone.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Can you identify how these thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: They make me feel hopeless and anxious. Sometimes I can’t even focus on my work because I’m just stuck in my head with all these negative thoughts.

Consultant: It seems like the way you see the situation is amplifying your distress. Have you noticed any particular patterns in your thinking that might be unhelpful or extreme?

User: Yes, for sure. I tend to think in black-and-white terms. If I mess up one thing, I feel like everything is a failure.

Consultant: That’s a common cognitive distortion called "all-or-nothing thinking." It can be quite limiting. If you were to challenge that thought, what might be a more balanced perspective?

User: I guess I could remind myself that mistakes happen and that one setback doesn’t define my entire performance at work.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that setbacks are part of learning can help shift your perspective. How do you think this new mindset might affect your feelings about going to work?

User: It might make me feel less anxious, knowing that I can learn from my mistakes instead of feeling defeated by them.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Now, thinking about those interactions with your boss, what are some practical steps you might take to address the situation and maybe improve the relationship?

User: Maybe I could request a one-on-one meeting to discuss my performance? I think that might help clear the air a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Open communication can often help ease tensions. How do you feel about approaching that conversation?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but it also feels like something I need to do.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous. One approach could be preparing what you want to say in advance. What points do you think are important to address in the meeting?

User: I want to express my willingness to improve and clarify any expectations my boss has for me.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach. By expressing openness and a desire to understand, you create a collaborative atmosphere. How might you handle any criticism you receive during the meeting?

User: I could try to keep an open mind and not take it personally, remembering that it’s meant for my growth.

Consultant: Exactly! Viewing feedback as a tool for growth can empower you. Now, shifting gears, let’s talk about your personal life. How are things going at home?

User: Honestly, it's pretty lonely. My relationship with my husband is also strained. I feel isolated in both my work and personal life.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. Feeling isolated can intensify your emotional struggles. What kind of support do you think you might need at home?

User: I wish we could communicate better. I feel like we’re just coexisting rather than connecting.

Consultant: Improving communication can make a big difference. Have you considered setting aside time to talk about how you're both feeling?

User: Not really. I guess I’ve been so overwhelmed that I didn’t think about reaching out to him.

Consultant: Taking that step to initiate a conversation, even if it's small, could help bridge the gap. What do you think you would want to share with him?

User: I want to tell him how I've been feeling and that I'm struggling. I hope he can understand where I'm coming from.

Consultant: That’s a brave step. Opening up can foster a sense of connection and support. How do you feel about taking this step in the near future?

User: I feel a little hesitant, but I know it's necessary. I just hope he responds well.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel hesitant. Perhaps framing it as seeking support could ease the pressure. You’re not alone in this. How have you been coping with these feelings of loneliness lately?

User: I’ve been trying to distract myself with TV and other things, but it doesn’t feel fulfilling.

Consultant: Finding the right forms of self-care is important. Maybe we can explore some activities that can help you feel more connected and less isolated?

User: That sounds good. I could consider reaching out to friends or engaging in some hobbies I used to enjoy.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reconnecting with friends or interests can foster a sense of belonging. What are some hobbies or activities that used to make you happy?

User: I used to love painting and going for walks in nature. I haven't done those things in a while.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ways to find some joy and relaxation! How about setting a small goal to incorporate one of these activities into your week?

User: I think I can try to go for a walk this weekend. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! Remember to be gentle with yourself through this process. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway you’re gaining from our conversation?

User: I think I learned that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and that I can take small steps to improve my situation, both at work and home.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Jiang. Recognizing that you have control over small actions can help reframe your experiences. As we conclude, remember that you have the tools to handle these challenges. If you ever feel the need to reach out again, I'm here for you.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. It sounds like you've been through a lot lately. Can you tell me more about your feelings and what you've been experiencing in your relationship with your husband?

User: Hi. I've been trying to talk to my husband to improve our relationship, but it doesn't seem to work. I just feel more alone and disappointed. It feels like I'm putting in all the effort without any response from him.

Consultant: I hear you. It must be really frustrating to feel like you're putting in the effort and not getting the support you need in return. Could you share what specific efforts you have made to communicate with him?

User: I tried to express my feelings clearly, but he often brushes me off or doesn’t seem interested. I feel like every time I reach out, it just leads to more arguments.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging. It seems that you're feeling unheard and perhaps misunderstood. In those moments when he brushes off your feelings, what thoughts come to mind? How does that impact how you feel?

User: I think that maybe he doesn’t care about me or that my feelings don’t matter. It makes me feel really sad and alone, like I’m fighting this battle all by myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel sad when you perceive that your feelings are not acknowledged. Those thoughts can intensify feelings of isolation. Let's explore this a little further. Do you think these thoughts reflect the reality of the situation, or could there be other interpretations?

User: I suppose there could be other interpretations, but it's hard when I'm in the moment. I just focus on how I feel rejected.

Consultant: That's a common reaction. When we're feeling vulnerable, it's easy to interpret situations in a negative light. Let's try to challenge that a bit. Can you think of any evidence that suggests your husband might care, even if it's not expressed in the way you need?

User: Sometimes he does small things for me, like making dinner or asking about my day. But I guess I just want deeper conversations.

Consultant: Those small actions are definitely signs that he cares. It sounds like what you really need is more emotional connection and meaningful conversations. What if we discussed some strategies for approaching those deeper conversations with him?

User: Sure, I’d appreciate that. I really want him to understand me better.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to schedule a specific time to talk when both of you are calm. How does that sound to you?

User: That could work, but I worry he’ll just avoid the conversation again.

Consultant: That’s valid. It might help to express to him why this conversation is important to you. Perhaps framing it as a way to strengthen your relationship could motivate him to engage. What do you think?

User: Yes, that makes sense. I often focus too much on what’s bothering me instead of how this conversation could help us.

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing the potential benefits could shift his perspective. Another technique could be to use "I" statements to express your feelings without blaming. For example, saying "I feel alone when we don’t talk" instead of "You never listen." Would you be comfortable trying that?

User: I think I could do that. It sounds less confrontational.

Consultant: Absolutely! How about we role-play a scenario where you might use an "I" statement with him? 

User: Okay, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Imagine you’re sitting down with him. How would you start the conversation using an "I" statement?

User: I might say something like, "I feel sad when we don’t spend time talking about our day."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! How do you think he might respond to that?

User: He could be surprised. I hope it might encourage him to open up too.

Consultant: That’s a great hope! It’s possible that it will create a space for him to share as well. Would there be any additional ways you might make it easier for him to engage in this conversation?

User: Maybe I could suggest we pick a relaxed time, like after dinner, when we’re both in a good mood.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Setting the scene for a relaxed conversation can help facilitate a better connection. How do you feel about putting this plan into action?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful that it could help improve things between us.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Change can be daunting. Remember, taking small steps towards open communication can gradually build trust and understanding in your relationship. 

User: Yes, I see that. I just want to feel heard more often.

Consultant: Absolutely. It’s about creating a safe space for both of you to express your feelings. By practicing these techniques, you might start to see shifts in your interactions. How do you feel about your confidence in approaching him now?

User: I feel more confident than before. Having a plan helps!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's a significant step forward. As we wrap up today, what are some key takeaways you’ll carry with you moving forward?

User: I’ll try to use "I" statements and create a relaxed setting for our talk. And remind myself of the small things he does that show he cares.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! These strategies can empower you and help to improve your communication. It's been great working with you today. If you feel comfortable, we can continue to explore this in our next session. 

User: Yes, I want to come back and share how it went. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today, Jiang. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been really anxious. I received some negative feedback at work, and now I'm worried about my job prospects. It feels like everything is just piling up, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been under a lot of pressure. Receiving negative feedback can be really tough. Let's talk about that feedback and how it's affecting your confidence and outlook on your career. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about the feedback you received?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not good enough for my job. The comments make me question my abilities, and I feel like I'm failing.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's completely understandable to have those feelings after receiving criticism. It seems like you're feeling a decline in your confidence. Could you share what specific thoughts go through your mind regarding your job performance?

User: I think about how my colleagues might view me after this feedback. I’m afraid they’ll see me as incompetent or that I’m not fit for the role.

Consultant: That’s a difficult place to be in, feeling like others may see you negatively. Let’s try to examine those thoughts closely. Do you believe there is evidence to support the idea that your colleagues view you as incompetent, or could there be other perspectives to consider?

User: I guess I don't really know what they think. I’m just imagining the worst-case scenarios in my head, which makes me more anxious.

Consultant: It's common for our minds to jump to worst-case scenarios, especially in stressful situations. What if we work on reframing those thoughts? If you were to think about a more balanced perspective regarding your feedback, what might that look like?

User: Maybe the feedback is just one part of my performance and not the whole picture. There have been times when I received positive feedback, too.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Focusing on those positive experiences can help you rebuild your confidence. Can you recall a specific instance where you received positive feedback? What was it about, and how did it make you feel?

User: Yes, there was a project last year that I led. My manager said I did a great job and that the team appreciated my efforts. It felt really good.

Consultant: That’s an excellent memory to hold on to. It reflects your capabilities and contributions. Now, thinking of that positive experience, how can we use it to counteract the negative feelings you're experiencing now? 

User: I suppose I can remind myself that I am capable and that my past successes shouldn’t be overshadowed by this one negative moment.

Consultant: Exactly! Holding onto your past achievements will help strengthen your self-efficacy. How about we explore some specific steps or strategies you can take in the coming week to reinforce this positive mindset?

User: Maybe I could start by listing out my achievements or tasks that I know I’ve done well, and look at that list when I start feeling low.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Keeping a record of your successes can serve as a powerful reminder of your abilities. Is there anything else you think would help you manage your anxiety about work?

User: I think just talking about these things helps. Perhaps I could also practice some relaxation techniques when I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Relaxation techniques can definitely help you cope with anxiety. Do you have any particular exercises in mind, or would you like to discuss some options?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing exercises and mindfulness. I think I’d like to try those.

Consultant: Those are great options! Deep breathing can be very grounding. Mindfulness techniques can help you stay present and reduce anxious thoughts. Would you like to set a specific time each day to practice these techniques?

User: Yes, I could probably try to do it in the morning before starting work to set a positive tone for the day.

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to approach it! Starting your day positively can have a great impact. How do you feel about sharing these plans with a supportive friend or family member? It might help to have someone to encourage you.

User: I like that idea. I think I will talk to my husband about it. He tends to be very supportive.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful support plan. It’s great to have someone who understands what you’re going through. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your main takeaways, and how do you feel moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful about taking practical steps to rebuild my confidence. I realize I can control my thoughts better, and I have supportive people to help me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective to have! It seems like you’re developing a clearer path forward. When we meet again, we can check in on your progress and explore any new experiences you’ve had. Remember that you’re not alone in this process; I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You're welcome, Jiang. Take care and be gentle with yourself. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today’s session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been trying to balance my work and personal life, and I’ve started to join some social activities. But I still feel a lot of pressure and can't really relax completely.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making efforts to engage more socially, which is a positive step. I'm curious, how do you feel about these new social activities? 

User: I feel excited about them, but there’s still a sense of anxiety. Sometimes I don’t know what to say or how to act, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: I understand. It’s great that you're trying new things, but feeling anxious in social situations is common. Can you describe a specific moment when you felt anxious during these activities?

User: Yes, I went to a friend’s gathering last week. I wanted to talk to everyone, but I was constantly worried that I would say something silly or awkward.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s natural to worry about how others perceive us, but it can be quite overwhelming. What thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking, “What if I embarrass myself?” and that made me feel tense and just want to leave.

Consultant: That kind of thinking can really heighten your anxiety. Can you see how those thoughts create a cycle of worry for you? 

User: Yes, I can see that. It’s like I get stuck in my head and the thoughts just spiral.

Consultant: Exactly. So, let’s try to identify those thoughts more clearly. When you think, “What if I embarrass myself?” what feelings does that bring up for you?

User: I feel nervous and sometimes even a bit panicky, like I can’t breathe properly. 

Consultant: It sounds very distressing. How do you think you could challenge that thought? For instance, what evidence do you have that you would embarrass yourself if you engage in conversation?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I’ve had some nice conversations before, but I still get stuck in the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Remembering positive experiences can help counter those negative thoughts. Can you think of a particular conversation that went well for you?

User: Yes, I had a great chat with one of the guests at the gathering. We laughed and shared stories. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! So, if you could focus on that experience the next time you feel anxious, do you think it could help you feel more confident?

User: Yes, I think that could help me shift my mindset a bit.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s also talk about activities that bring you joy. Have you discovered any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?

User: I’ve been exploring painting recently, and it feels nice to express myself that way.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful outlet! How does engaging in painting make you feel compared to when you’re anticipating social events?

User: Painting feels freeing and calming. It’s like a world away from all my worries.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Using painting as a way to unwind might also help ease your anxiety in social situations. How about planning some time for painting before your next gathering?

User: That sounds like a good idea. It might help me relax more before I go out.

Consultant: Yes! It can also act as a positive anchor for you. What are your thoughts on incorporating that into your routine?

User: I’d like to try that. Maybe I can set aside time to paint a few hours before social events.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've learned. How can you apply this to enhance your social interactions?

User: I will remember to focus on positive past experiences and use painting to help me relax beforehand.

Consultant: Excellent! It seems like you are developing some actionable strategies to manage your anxiety. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel optimistic. It's nice to have some tools to handle my feelings better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to embrace these feelings as part of your growth. Please feel free to reach out as you continue this journey. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and the support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing how it goes. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you today, Jiang. I'm glad you found some joy in the community activities. How do you feel about your recent experiences with your new friends?

User: Hi! I’m feeling much better after participating in those activities. It’s nice to connect with like-minded people, but I worry about bringing this positive feeling into my daily life.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling better and enjoying those connections. What do you think would help you carry that positive energy into your daily routines?

User: I believe if I could have more interactions like those, it would help. But sometimes, I feel overwhelmed about how to maintain these connections in my busy life.

Consultant: It sounds like you value those interactions, but there’s a concern about balancing them with your daily responsibilities. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming to you?

User: I have so much work to do, and when I think about making plans with friends, I often feel guilty for not focusing on my tasks. This conflict makes it hard for me to relax.

Consultant: That’s a common experience—wanting to socialize while also feeling the weight of responsibilities. How about we explore ways to blend your social life with your daily tasks? What do you think?

User: Yes, I think that’s a good idea. Maybe if I plan social activities around my schedule, it could work better.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! What kind of social activities do you enjoy the most? Perhaps we can brainstorm a few that fit nicely into your schedule.

User: I really enjoy going for coffee or attending workshops. They feel more relaxed, and I can sometimes squeeze them in during a break.

Consultant: Wonderful! Coffee breaks and workshops could be excellent opportunities to connect without overwhelming yourself. How often would you like to incorporate these activities into your week?

User: I’d love to connect with friends for coffee once a week. I think that would be manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting a specific time each week for coffee with friends could help you anticipate and look forward to those moments. How might you feel leading up to and during these coffee meetups?

User: I think I would feel excited! It would break the monotony of my routine and give me something to look forward to.

Consultant: Excitement is a fantastic feeling to cultivate! It’s great to see you acknowledge the potential joy from these meetups. Are there any lingering worries about maintaining these connections?

User: Well, I sometimes worry that my friends might be busy and might not want to meet regularly. What if I reach out and they can’t?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s natural to feel apprehensive about reaching out. Remember, friendships can be flexible. What would you like to do if a friend is unable to meet on a planned date?

User: I guess I could suggest an alternative time, or perhaps I could meet someone else. I just don’t want to feel like I'm bothering them.

Consultant: It’s commendable that you’re considerate of your friends’ time! A lot of times, friends appreciate the effort to connect. How would it feel to be proactive about suggesting an alternative when plans don't work out?

User: I think it would feel encouraging. It gives me a sense of control rather than just waiting and worrying about their response.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking control of the situation can be empowering. By suggesting alternatives, you’re showing your friends you value the connection. How do you feel about setting those intentions for your upcoming coffee meetups?

User: I feel more confident about it now. I’ll try to keep that mindset when reaching out.

Consultant: That's a fantastic shift in mindset! As you continue to plan these activities, remember to celebrate each successful connection. What positive reinforcement will you give yourself after each meetup?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, maybe buy a new book or enjoy a little indulgence after each meetup.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to reward yourself! Treating yourself can reinforce the positive feelings from the connections you've made. How do you feel about tracking your progress as you implement this plan over the next few weeks?

User: I’d like that! It would help me see how much I'm improving. Maybe I could keep a little journal to note my thoughts and feelings after each meetup.

Consultant: A journal is a great idea! It will allow you to reflect on each experience and acknowledge your feelings. How do you anticipate your emotional state to evolve as you implement these strategies?

User: I hope I’ll feel more fulfilled and less alone. Having regular interactions should boost my mood and help me feel more connected.

Consultant: That’s a lovely outlook! Feeling connected can significantly enhance your overall well-being. As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our session that you'd like to carry forward into your upcoming week?

User: I’ll focus on planning my coffee meetups, keeping a journal, and treating myself afterward. I’m feeling more positive about engaging with my friends!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Jiang! It sounds like you’re making great strides. Remember, it’s okay to start small, and every step counts. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Keep nurturing those positive interactions!

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to next week’s session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! It's great to see you again. I hope you've been doing well. Today, I’d like to reflect on the progress you've made and explore how we can continue to support your positive changes. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more stable lately. My work has been recognized, and I think my communication with my family has improved. I feel a bit more confident in my life and abilities.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's encouraging to hear that you've received recognition at work and that your family communication has improved. How do you think these changes have impacted your overall mood and outlook?

User: I believe it's helped me regain some of the confidence I lost. I feel less overwhelmed and more capable of handling challenges, but there are still moments when I doubt myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those doubts, especially after experiencing ups and downs. Can you share a specific moment when you felt that self-doubt creeping in recently? What thoughts went through your mind at that time?

User: I had a presentation at work last week that I was anxious about. Even though people said I did well, I kept thinking about all the things I could have done better. It made me feel like I was never enough.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like your mind was quick to focus on the critique rather than the positive feedback you received. Let's explore that feeling further. What thoughts were you having during the presentation, and how did they make you feel?

User: During the presentation, I was worried everyone could see how nervous I was. Afterward, I was just fixated on small mistakes instead of celebrating the good parts. It left me feeling disappointed with myself.

Consultant: That’s insightful. It seems that the pressure of wanting to be perfect affects how you perceive your performance. How do you think this tendency to focus on the negatives shapes your view of your capabilities overall?

User: It makes me feel like I’m not progressing as much as I should be. I sometimes compare myself to others, and it just leads to frustration because I feel like I’m falling behind.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can be quite detrimental to our self-esteem. What would happen if you shifted your focus from comparing to celebrating your own achievements instead? How could that affect your confidence?

User: I think it would help me feel more accomplished. If I recognized my own progress instead of measuring against others, I might find more motivation to keep improving.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Recognizing your journey can be a great motivator. What are some methods you could use to celebrate your progress and achievements moving forward?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my successes or set small, personal goals that I can achieve. That might help me acknowledge my own improvements.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Journaling can be particularly therapeutic, as it allows you to reflect on your path and document your victories. How do you feel about incorporating that into your daily routine?

User: I feel positive about it. Writing down my achievements can help me remember that I’m making progress, even if it’s slow.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like a constructive approach. Besides journaling, are there any challenges you are currently facing that we could discuss further to build on your successes?

User: I think sometimes I still struggle with communicating openly, particularly when my husband and I disagree. I want to be better at expressing my thoughts without feeling defensive or overwhelmed.

Consultant: Open communication is essential, especially in close relationships. What thoughts or fears come up for you when you need to express yourself during disagreements with your husband?

User: I worry that my thoughts won’t be heard or that he might react negatively, which makes me hesitant. I often end up avoiding the conversation altogether.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. It can be daunting to voice your thoughts when you're concerned about the other person's reaction. Would you be willing to practice expressing what you feel in a safe and constructive way to help reduce that anxiety?

User: Yes, I think that would help. Practice could make me feel more comfortable when the moment arises.

Consultant: Great! We can role-play some scenarios where you express your feelings. Let's start with a mild disagreement—how would you typically approach that conversation?

User: Well, I usually just express my frustration, but I often do it defensively. I know I shouldn’t, but I get caught up in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. Let’s work on rephrasing that frustration into a more constructive expression that communicates your feelings without putting up defenses. What could you say instead?

User: Maybe I could start with “I feel upset when…” instead of “You always...” That sounds better because it centers on my feelings rather than blaming him.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with “I feel” makes it easier for the other person to understand your perspective. How would it feel to try that approach next time?

User: It makes me feel more hopeful about talking it out. I think it could lead to better understanding between us.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in perspective! Remember, it’s a skill that takes practice. I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time we meet. Is there anything else you’d like to cover today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. I feel more equipped to handle both my self-reflection and my communication challenges. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m really proud of the progress you've made, Jiang. Keep working on those strategies, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. Until next time, take care of yourself!

User: I will! Thank you again. Looking forward to our next session!
