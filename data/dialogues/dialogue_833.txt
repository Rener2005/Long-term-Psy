Consultant: Hello, Zhang Xiao! I'm grateful you're here for this session. I know you’ve been through a lot recently. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel quite low. I can't shake off this overwhelming sadness, especially after realizing no one knew about my father's passing. It makes me feel really alone and guilty. 

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult, Zhang Xiao. It’s normal to feel a lot of sadness and guilt after such a significant loss. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that maybe if I had been more attentive, I could have done something to help him. It just feels like I failed him.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts of failure and guilt can be very heavy. It's important to recognize that blaming ourselves can often distort our understanding of these situations. What evidence do you have that you actually could have helped him in that moment?

User: I don't know. I just feel like I missed a lot of signs. Maybe if I had checked in more often...

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s try to look at this from a different angle. If a friend were in your situation, what would you say to them about their feelings of guilt?

User: I guess I would say that it’s not always easy to see what’s happening with others. Sometimes life just happens, and we can't control everything.

Consultant: Exactly. It’s easy to be our own harshest critic. It sounds like you can recognize that not everything is within our control. Would it help to explore some of these thoughts further together?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I want to understand why I keep blaming myself.

Consultant: Great! Let’s look at one of those thoughts you mentioned—feeling like you failed your father. Can we examine it together? What if we challenged the belief that you could have fully understood what he was going through?

User: That makes sense. It's just... sometimes I feel like I should've known better.

Consultant: It’s natural to wish we could have done more, but wishing doesn't change the reality of the situation. Let’s think about whether you have any realistic evidence that you could have changed the outcome.

User: I suppose I don't have any concrete evidence. I just keep feeling sad and guilty.

Consultant: Feeling sad and guilty doesn't mean you are to blame for what has happened. Let's try to replace that thought with something more balanced. What would a more supportive thought look like for you?

User: Maybe something like, "I did what I could at the time, and it’s okay to feel sad about my loss.”

Consultant: That’s a much kinder perspective. Recognizing your limitations is key. How do you feel about that new thought?

User: I feel a bit lighter, but it's still hard to let go of the guilt completely.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s a process to shift these deep feelings. Let’s try to focus on some of the positive memories you have of your father. What do you cherish the most about him?

User: He always encouraged me to pursue my studies and follow my dreams. He believed in me.

Consultant: That’s beautiful. Holding onto those encouraging thoughts can help counteract some of the heaviness of guilt. How could you incorporate these positive memories into your daily life?

User: Maybe I could talk to my friends about them and remind myself of his encouragement when I study.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing those memories can be a powerful way to keep his spirit alive. Additionally, let's think about ways to actively manage your feelings, such as journaling or practicing self-compassion when the guilt arises.

User: Journaling sounds like a good idea. I think writing it down might help me process my feelings better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step. Writing can provide clarity. After journaling, perhaps you can also try some calming activities before bed to help with your insomnia. Have you thought about what kind of activities might help you unwind?

User: I've tried listening to music, but it doesn't always work. I'm not sure what else to do.

Consultant: Music can be soothing for some, but if it doesn’t help, we can explore other options like meditation or gentle stretching. These activities can be calming and might aid your sleep. Would you be willing to try one of these approaches?

User: Yes, I’m open to trying meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful.

Consultant: That’s great! Starting with just a few minutes each day might help clear your mind. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these feelings. We can work together on this.

User: Thank you. It feels good to have a plan and someone to talk to about it.

Consultant: I’m here for you, Zhang Xiao. Taking these small steps is a sign of moving forward. As we continue, we can keep exploring your feelings and find strategies that work best for you. 

User: I appreciate it. It does make me feel a little less alone.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember that it’s okay to lean on others and share your experiences. Let’s continue focusing on how you can maintain that connection and strength moving forward. 

User: Yes, I want to keep working on this. 

Consultant: Fantastic! In our next session, we can check in on how your journaling and meditation practices are going. It’s all about gradual progress, and I believe you’re on the right path. 

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Me too! Let’s recap what we’ve talked about today. You’ve begun to challenge your feelings of guilt, while also celebrating your father’s memory and finding new ways to cope with your emotions.

User: Yes, that’s right.

Consultant: As we wrap up, please remember that it’s okay to reach out for help when you need it. You are not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you for your support. It really helps me.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang Xiao. I look forward to our next session, and remember, you’re doing the best you can. 

User: Thanks again. I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I’d like to check in on how you've been feeling since our last session. What's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low and lonely, especially with all the pressure from my studies. Sometimes, the feelings of guilt and sadness about my father's death just come flooding back, and it’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of intense emotions, particularly with the weight of your studies and the memories of your father. Can you share a bit more about how these feelings affect your daily life?

User: Well, I struggle to concentrate on my work, and I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I find it hard to want to do anything at all. A part of me feels like I shouldn’t be feeling this way, especially after so much time has passed since my father's death.

Consultant: I see, and it's completely understandable to feel that way. Often, we expect ourselves to move on quickly from difficult losses, but that’s rarely the case. What do you think might be contributing to these feelings of guilt or self-blame?

User: I guess I still blame myself for not being able to save him. Sometimes I think if I had done something differently, he would still be here. 

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really heavy to carry around. Let’s take a moment to explore those feelings. What evidence do you have that supports this belief that you could have saved him?

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence. It’s just what I keep telling myself whenever I think about it. 

Consultant: Recognizing that is a big step. It seems like your mind is creating a very harsh narrative about your father’s passing. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about that feeling of blame?

User: I would probably tell them it’s not their fault, that sometimes things just happen that we can't control.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remind yourself that you couldn’t control the circumstances. Let's think about some alternative thoughts that could help you reframe your feelings. What if you focused on the love you had for your father, instead of the guilt?

User: That would make more sense, but it’s hard for me to let go of the guilt. I think about it all the time.

Consultant: Changing ingrained thoughts takes time and effort. It's okay to feel that way as we work through this. Perhaps we can implement some small reminders or activities that allow you to honor your father’s memory in a loving way instead of associating it with guilt.

User: That might help. I just don’t want to forget him. 

Consultant: Remembering him is a positive way to keep his memory alive in your heart. What could be a meaningful way for you to remember him that brings you comfort instead of pain?

User: Maybe I can write him a letter about how I feel and what’s been happening in my life.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Writing can be a powerful outlet for emotions. It allows you to express feelings that might be hard to say out loud. How do you think that would make you feel?

User: I think it would help me feel a bit lighter, like I'm sharing my thoughts with him.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful perspective. It’s like creating a space for connection even when he is no longer physically present. How about we discuss other things in your life that may trigger these feelings of isolation and sadness?

User: Sure. I've been feeling quite alone in my studies. I don’t reach out to classmates much, and social events are hard for me.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel alone, especially at university. Social interactions can be overwhelming but are often essential for support. How do you feel when you think about reaching out to classmates?

User: I feel anxious and assume they wouldn’t be interested in hanging out with me. I end up just isolating myself.

Consultant: It makes sense that anxiety holds you back. What if we tried to challenge that thought? What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to spend time with you?

User: I don’t have any concrete evidence. I guess I just assume they’re too busy or don’t find me interesting.

Consultant: Those assumptions can often be misleading. Maybe we can approach this with a small step? For instance, what if you reached out to one classmate to study together? Would that feel manageable?

User: I could try that. It does sound less intimidating than jumping into a big group. 

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Even small steps can lead to more connections over time. How would you feel after reaching out?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself. Maybe it would help ease some of my loneliness.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's a step towards breaking that cycle of isolation. Remember, every small step counts. Do you feel ready to try this next week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we continue, let's also discuss ways to manage your emotions when you find yourself feeling overwhelmed. What coping strategies have you tried?

User: Sometimes I just listen to music, but nothing feels like it's helping lately.

Consultant: Music can be a great comfort. However, when emotions feel particularly heavy, it might be beneficial to explore other options like breathing exercises or mindfulness. Would you like to learn a technique that could help in those moments?

User: Yes, I’d be open to that.

Consultant: Great! We can start with a simple breathing exercise. It helps ground you and create a sense of calm. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Sure, let’s give it a shot.

Consultant: Alright. Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a moment... and now exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Keep practicing this, focusing on each breath. How does that feel?

User: It actually feels nice to focus on my breathing. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! This can be a helpful tool whenever you feel your emotions escalating. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support. You’re not alone in this journey, Zhang. As we wrap up today's session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What stands out the most for you? 

User: I think recognizing my feelings of guilt is important. Also, it’s comforting to think about honoring my dad positively and reaching out to others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway. You’ve made significant steps today, and I’m proud of you. In our next session, let’s explore how the letter-writing goes and how reaching out feels. Remember, you're doing your best. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhang! I'll see you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit mixed. I received a letter from my brother recently, and it made me really emotional. I appreciate his concern, but I also feel guilty about burdening him.

Consultant: It sounds like that letter has stirred up a lot of feelings for you. On one hand, you feel touched by his care, but on the other, there's guilt about how your situation might affect him. Can you tell me more about the emotions you're experiencing right now?

User: I'm definitely feeling grateful, but it's also overwhelming. I still struggle with sleep and sometimes don’t feel like eating. The emotions just seem to come and go. 

Consultant: I understand. It's difficult to navigate such a whirlwind of feelings. You mentioned struggling with sleep and appetite. Can we explore how these emotions connect to those physical symptoms?

User: Sure. When I feel overwhelmed, I just can't sleep at night. My thoughts race, and I end up staring at the ceiling. During the day, when I think about my brother, it makes me feel heavy. 

Consultant: That heaviness can really impact your daily life. When you're lying awake at night, what kinds of thoughts are running through your mind? 

User: I often replay memories of my mother and think about how things could have been different if she were still here. And then I worry about my father and the future.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and understandably distressing. It seems like there's a lot of concern wrapped up in those memories. Do you find that these thoughts make you feel anxious or sad?

User: Yes, definitely. They make me feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of sadness. I want to escape those feelings, but I don't know how to stop thinking about them.

Consultant: It can feel quite immobilizing when you’re stuck in those cycles of thought. One approach we can consider is identifying specific negative thoughts that come up. Can you think of a particular thought that stands out in those moments of sadness?

User: I often think, “I shouldn’t feel this way, I need to be stronger for my brother.” 

Consultant: That’s an important thought to recognize. It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be strong, which can be quite overwhelming. What evidence do you have to support that thought? 

User: I guess I just feel like I’m a burden and that I need to hold everything together for my family.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you might be underestimating your own need for support. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably encourage them to talk about their feelings and remind them that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It seems like you genuinely understand the importance of being open about feelings. What if you allowed yourself to experience that same compassion towards yourself? 

User: That does make sense. I think I need to be kinder to myself. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Kindness towards ourselves is so important. Perhaps we can develop some strategies for you to allow yourself to express your emotions without guilt. Would you be open to trying out an emotion journal to document your feelings?

User: An emotion journal? I’ve never tried that before. How does it work? 

Consultant: It’s quite simple. You would take some time each day to write about what you’re feeling, any triggers, and how you reacted. This can help you identify patterns and become more aware of your emotions without judgment. 

User: That sounds helpful. I like the idea of having a space to sort through my thoughts.

Consultant: Great! It’s a safe space just for you. Also, when you notice those feelings becoming overwhelming, practicing deep breathing might help. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before?

User: I haven’t really practiced any relaxation techniques. I just try to distract myself when things get too heavy.

Consultant: Distraction can be a quick fix, but let’s work on deep breathing. It can help you feel more grounded. Would you like to practice that together right now?

User: Yes, I’d like to try. 

Consultant: Perfect! Let's take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale for a count of six. Ready? Inhale... hold... exhale... 

User: (breathes) That feels more calming, actually.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can return to this exercise whenever you feel the weight of those emotions. How do you feel about that approach so far?

User: I feel hopeful that I can start managing my emotions better. Writing and breathing could really help.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have! Progress takes time, and it’s perfectly okay to feel a bit of fluctuation in your emotions as you try these new strategies. 

User: I appreciate that. I’m willing to give it a try and not be too hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset, Zhang! Keep being gentle with yourself. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about our session and what you’ve learned?

User: I feel more equipped to handle my feelings. The idea of journaling is exciting, and the breathing technique is comforting.

Consultant: I’m really happy to hear that! You’re taking important steps towards emotional management. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out for help whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you for your guidance. It helps to share this with you.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad we’ve worked together today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Me too. Thank you! 

Consultant: Take care, Zhang. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm really glad you're here today. I remember from our last session that you felt some safety in sharing your feelings during the school workshop. How have you been since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with sharing my thoughts. Sometimes, I feel like I’m a burden when I talk to others.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been feeling a bit better! Sharing can definitely feel challenging at times, especially with feelings of being a burden. Can you tell me a bit more about those feelings? What do you experience when you think about sharing your thoughts?

User: I guess I worry that people won't care or won't want to hear what I have to say. It just makes me feel really anxious.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be really tough to open up when you're worried about how others might react. It sounds like there's a lot of fear surrounding sharing. Have you had any recent experiences where you felt comfortable sharing, like in the workshop?

User: Yes, during the workshop, I felt surprisingly safe when we were sharing in small groups. I liked that everyone was supportive, but I still find it hard to reach out afterward.

Consultant: It’s a positive step that you found the workshop supportive! Those feelings of comfort are important, and building on that is key. What do you think held you back from reaching out to others after the workshop?

User: I think it’s because I don’t really know how to continue those conversations. I feel lost about what to say next.

Consultant: Feeling lost after such experiences is entirely normal. It's all about taking small steps. What if we practiced a few ways to continue a conversation? We could role-play a scenario where you might reach out to someone. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's imagine you're in a club meeting, and you've just met someone new. What would you want to ask them or share that could spark a conversation?

User: Maybe I could ask about their interests or what they think about the club activities. That seems safe enough.

Consultant: That's an excellent start! Asking about interests is a great way to keep the conversation going. And once you get the ball rolling, you might find it easier to share your feelings too. How do you feel about initiating a conversation like that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited at the same time. I like the idea of finding common interests.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling a mix of nerves and excitement. That shows you're ready to step outside your comfort zone! Let’s think of a couple of opening lines you could use. For instance, “What brought you to this club?” What do you think about that?

User: I like that! It's simple and direct. 

Consultant: Exactly! Simple and direct is often the best approach. You can build from there based on their response. How does practicing this feel for you? 

User: It’s a little nerve-wracking, but also feels possible. I think I could try this. 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. The key is to take little steps and celebrate your efforts, no matter the outcome. What would you like to focus on for our next session?

User: I’d like to talk about how the conversations go after I try reaching out, and maybe work on handling any anxiety that comes with it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Reflecting on your experiences will help us identify areas to work on together. You're making progress, Zhang. Just remember to be kind to yourself in this process. 

User: Thank you! It feels good to have a plan and know I can talk about how it goes next time.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Let's keep building that confidence and ensuring you feel safe expressing your emotions. Keep in mind that it's perfectly normal to face challenges along the way.

User: Yes, I understand. I’ll try to keep that in mind during my conversations.

Consultant: That's great! Before we close today, let’s recap what you want to focus on moving forward. You’re working on initiating conversations and reflecting on how they feel. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

User: No, I think that covers it. Just feeling hopeful about trying again is a big step for me.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion, and it sounds like you're building a strong foundation for future connections. Remember, every little effort counts. 

User: Thanks for reminding me. I appreciate your support!

Consultant: It's my pleasure! I'm here to support you, and I believe in your ability to keep growing. We'll talk more about your progress next time. Take care, Zhang!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Xiao! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been working hard on participating in your school club. How have you been feeling about that recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling a bit proud of myself for committing to the club activities. But I also worry about whether I can keep it up. Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling proud! Engaging in activities can be really fulfilling. Let’s talk about those feelings of being overwhelmed. Can you share what specifically makes you feel that way?

User: I think it’s the fear of disappointing others if I can’t keep up with the commitments. I'm also worried about my time management since I still have classes and other responsibilities to handle.

Consultant: That makes sense. Balancing commitments can be challenging. You mentioned the fear of disappointing others—can you tell me more about those thoughts? What do you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think that if I don't show up or contribute as much, people will see me as unreliable. It's like I’m constantly comparing myself to others who seem to manage everything perfectly.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like these thoughts are quite heavy. Have you considered if there’s another way to view your participation, besides just comparing yourself to others?

User: Sometimes I do think about how my participation is about my own growth and learning rather than just for the group. But it’s hard to shake off the feeling of inadequacy.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective, Zhang Xiao. Focusing on your personal growth is really important. Let’s explore those feelings of inadequacy a bit more. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: They make me anxious and sometimes a bit hopeless. I feel like I’m not good enough and it frustrates me.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to carry those feelings. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts together. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the idea that you're inadequate? Have there been times when you felt successful or appreciated in your involvement?

User: Well, during a recent meeting, my ideas were well-received, and my peers said I did a good job. That felt nice, but then the doubt crept back in afterward.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you received positive feedback! Those moments are significant and can serve as reminders of your capabilities. What if you focused on those affirming experiences instead of allowing doubt to overshadow them?

User: That sounds good, but it’s easier said than done. Sometimes, my mind just fixates on the negative.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Our minds can often gravitate toward the negative. Let’s practice a technique: when those self-doubting thoughts arise, can you try to replace them with affirming ones? Perhaps remind yourself of that positive feedback you received.

User: I can try that. It might help to write these down to remind myself during tougher moments.

Consultant: Writing them down is an excellent idea! It creates a tangible reminder of your strengths. Can you think of other strategies we can incorporate to help manage these feelings of overwhelm and anxiety?

User: Maybe creating a schedule could help. That way, I can plan my study time and club activities better without feeling rushed.

Consultant: Absolutely! A structured schedule can definitely ease that sense of overwhelm. Let’s think about how you might set that up. What specific time can you dedicate to your club and studies?

User: I could set time in the afternoons after my classes for club activities and some evenings for studying. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing clear boundaries for your time will help you manage duties without the feeling of being swamped. How do you feel about committing to this schedule?

User: I feel hopeful. I think having a plan will ease my mind and balance things out.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's all about taking those manageable steps forward. As you continue to engage in club activities, keep reflecting on how you feel after each session. 

User: Yes, I will. I’ll also try to acknowledge my successes, no matter how small.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Recognizing all achievements is crucial for your confidence. Now, let’s take a moment to summarize what we've discussed today about managing those feelings and increasing your participation motivation.

User: Sure! I’ve learned that I can focus on my growth, challenge negative thoughts, and create a balanced schedule.

Consultant: Exactly! These strategies will support you in maintaining your motivation. Before our session wraps up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to share or ask?

User: I think I feel good about our conversation. It helps to have strategies to cope with my feelings. 

Consultant: I'm delighted to hear that, Zhang Xiao! You've made great progress today. Remember to embrace your journey and keep connecting your experiences with personal growth. I'm here whenever you need support in the future! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. My sleep has improved somewhat, and I’ve been able to manage my emotions better than before. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some positive changes. Can you share a specific moment where you noticed this improvement in your emotions?

User: Yes, there was a day last week when I felt really overwhelmed. Instead of spiraling down, I managed to talk to a close friend about my feelings, and that helped a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step! Reaching out to a friend can really provide support. How did that conversation make you feel afterwards?

User: I felt relieved and a little lighter. It was nice to have someone listen to me without judgment. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Zhang. Listening without judgment can be a comforting experience. What do you think contributed to your ability to open up to your friend?

User: I think part of it was the realization that keeping everything inside was too heavy for me. I wanted to share my burden, and I felt ready to do so.

Consultant: That’s an insightful realization! Recognizing when we need support is such an important step. Since we're summarizing your journey today, what specific strategies or insights from our past sessions do you feel have helped you the most?

User: I think the exercises we did on identifying my feelings and understanding the roots of my anxiety were really helpful. They made me more aware of my triggers.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to see how reflective you've become. Awareness is key in managing emotions effectively. Looking ahead, what are some goals or plans you want to set for yourself to continue this positive trajectory?

User: I want to focus on maintaining my social connections and perhaps join a study group at school. I believe that interacting with others could further help my mood.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Engaging with others can not only provide support but also help combat feelings of loneliness. What steps do you think you could take to start this process?

User: I could start by reaching out to classmates and suggesting we meet regularly to study together. I’ll just need to push myself a little out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: Yes, stepping out of your comfort zone can be challenging but very rewarding. Are there any fears or concerns that you have about this step?

User: I’m worried that they might not want to spend time with me, or that I might not fit in with them.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal. What might you say to challenge those negative thoughts? For instance, could you consider alternative outcomes that might happen?

User: I guess it’s possible they might actually enjoy my company. After all, we are in the same situation as students, so we may have a lot in common.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a much more balanced perspective. What could you do to remind yourself of this positive possibility when feelings of doubt arise?

User: Maybe I could write down some affirmations or reminders about my worth and the qualities I bring to a group dynamic.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Affirmations can be very powerful. Do you have any specific affirmations in mind that resonate with you?

User: I could use something like, “I am worthy of friendship and connection,” or “I have valuable insights to share.”

Consultant: Those are fantastic affirmations! Keeping them visible could serve as a good reminder. As we start to wrap up, what do you feel is the most significant change you’ve experienced in your emotional journey?

User: I would say it’s the ability to recognize my feelings instead of just suppressing them. I’ve learned that it’s okay to reach out for help.

Consultant: That’s a monumental change, Zhang! It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. As you continue on this journey, what strategies do you think you’ll use to maintain this progress?

User: I think regularly checking in with myself and possibly continuing to talk to my friend when I feel overwhelmed will help. Also, I plan to engage more in social activities.

Consultant: Those are very proactive approaches! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I believe you’re well-equipped for continued growth. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before our session concludes today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot! I feel more optimistic about the future now.

Consultant: I'm truly happy to hear that, Zhang! Summarizing your improvements today has shown how far you’ve come. Remember, maintaining the connections you’ve built and the strategies you’ve learned will serve you well. If you ever need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out.
