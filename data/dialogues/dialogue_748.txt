Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve still been feeling pretty down and isolated. I thought things would improve after the midterms, but they didn't. My grades were just average, and now I’m questioning whether I belong here in this university.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty about your place in university. Let’s explore that a little more. Can you tell me about what specific thoughts have crossed your mind after receiving your exam results?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not smart enough to be here. All my classmates seem to have their lives figured out, and I just feel lost. It’s really hard to sit in classes and engage when I feel this way.

Consultant: Feeling lost and doubting your abilities can be really overwhelming. It’s important to recognize those feelings. What emotions do you experience when you think about your classmates and your own situation?

User: I feel anxious and embarrassed. I often worry that they’ll notice I’m not doing as well as they are. Sometimes I even get panic attacks thinking about participating in class.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing quite a bit of anxiety in comparison to your peers. Let’s try to identify some of those automatic thoughts. When you find yourself feeling anxious in class, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that everyone will judge me if I say something wrong or that I’ll embarrass myself in front of them. It makes me want to just avoid speaking altogether.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s common to fear judgment in social situations. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your classmates would judge you negatively if you made a mistake?

User: I know that sometimes everyone makes mistakes, but in my mind, I just can't shake the feeling that they are all better than me. It makes it really hard to speak up.

Consultant: It’s easy to get caught in that cycle of negative thinking. How would you encourage a friend who felt this way? What would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone has their struggles and that we should focus on learning rather than being perfect. I just wish I could believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It's helpful to think of self-compassion. What if we tried to find a more balanced thought for yourself when you’re feeling this anxiety? How might you reframe your thought about speaking up in class?

User: Maybe I could think something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone is here to learn, and I have something valuable to share too.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframe! Practicing that kind of self-talk can gradually help you feel more at ease. Now, let’s talk about some actions you can take. What’s something small you might do in the coming week to practice speaking up in class?

User: I could try to ask at least one question during each class. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Asking questions can be a simple but powerful way to engage. How do you think you’ll feel after you accomplish that?

User: I think it might make me feel a bit more confident, like I’m starting to take charge of my learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking those small steps can lead to greater confidence over time. Are there any specific situations that might feel particularly tough for you to apply this in?

User: I think the discussion sections are the hardest because it feels like everyone is paying attention to one another.

Consultant: That’s understandable. During these discussions, would you be open to reminding yourself of your balanced thought before contributing? 

User: Yes, I’ll remind myself that everyone is there to learn and that it’s normal to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan. Remember that progress takes time, and it’s okay to feel uncertain. How are you feeling about moving forward with these strategies?

User: I feel a bit hopeful actually. Knowing that I can work on this gives me a little energy to try. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building hope is an important step. To wrap up our session today, let’s take a moment to summarize. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’m starting to recognize my negative thought patterns and how to challenge them. And I feel motivated to practice speaking up more in class.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! As you continue practicing these skills, remember you’re not alone on this journey. If those feelings of isolation arise, try to engage with others about your experiences. Would you agree that reaching out can be beneficial?

User: Yes, definitely! I’ll try to be more open about my feelings with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. Remember, you’re doing great work, and it’s completely normal to have ups and downs. If you need support before then, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Take care, and I'll see you soon.

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? Any specific challenges you'd like to discuss today?

User: Hi! I've been feeling very anxious lately, especially after that group discussion where I couldn't express my thoughts. It left me feeling frustrated and more isolated.

Consultant: I understand that feeling frustrated can be really disheartening, especially since you had hoped to express your ideas. Can you share what thoughts went through your mind during that discussion?

User: I remember thinking that everyone would judge me if I messed up. I felt so nervous that I just froze and couldn't speak.

Consultant: It sounds like you were really worried about being judged by others, which can make it hard to share your thoughts. What emotions did that lead you to feel during the discussion and afterward?

User: I felt embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I really wanted to contribute but ended up feeling like I let everyone down.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, Li. Many people experience similar feelings in social situations. It can be tough when our expectations don’t match the reality. Let's dive a little deeper—do you think this fear of judgment might be influencing how you see your capabilities in social situations?

User: Yes, I think so. I keep telling myself that I'm not good enough to fit in or to communicate effectively.

Consultant: That’s a challenging belief. It's understandable, but it's important to question its validity. Can we explore some evidence for and against this thought? What are some instances where you've successfully communicated with peers?

User: Well, there were times in high school when I participated in class discussions. I felt confident then, but now... I just can’t see myself being that way again.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It seems like you have had moments of confidence before. What do you think was different back in high school compared to now?

User: Back then, I knew everyone and felt comfortable. Here, I just feel out of place, like everyone is already friends.

Consultant: That makes sense. Moving to a new environment can be overwhelming. It sounds like comfort with familiarity played a big part in your confidence. How about we focus on ways to gradually build that sense of familiarity and comfort in your current surroundings? 

User: I’d like that. But I also worry about trying and failing again.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way. One approach could be to set small, manageable goals. What if we brainstorm some simple steps you could take to engage with your classmates without feeling too pressured?

User: I could try saying hi to someone in my class before or after the lecture. That feels a little less daunting.

Consultant: Initiating a simple greeting is a wonderful starting point! It's a low-pressure way to connect with others. How do you feel about trying that in the next few days?

User: I think I can do that. I just hope it goes well and I don't embarrass myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that hope, but remember that any step you take is progress, regardless of the outcome. If it doesn’t go as planned, we'll analyze it together to learn from the experience. What might you say to yourself if that happens?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous, and that I’m still trying my best.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy alternative. Self-compassion can help reduce that anxiety. Also, sometimes it helps to visualize a positive interaction beforehand. Could you try imagining a scenario where the greeting goes smoothly?

User: I could give that a shot. Visualizing it might make it feel more real and less intimidating. 

Consultant: Exactly! Visualization can create a sense of familiarity and reduce anxiety. As we continue, how can we work together to reinforce these small achievements and build on them?

User: Maybe we could set up more small goals, one at a time, and talk about how it went each session?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We can use our sessions to reflect on those goals and track your progress. What would you like to set as your next goal after the greeting?

User: Maybe I could aim to contribute at least one comment in the next class discussion. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Contributing even a small comment can be a meaningful step. How might you prepare for that, so you feel more at ease?

User: I could write down a few thoughts or questions before class, just to have something ready to say if there's a moment to jump in.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Having those notes can give you a confidence boost. Remember, engaging in discussions doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s about participating. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It helps to have small steps instead of feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Progress often comes from taking things one step at a time. As you begin implementing these strategies, how will you maintain a positive perspective on your journey?

User: I’ll try to focus on celebrating small successes and not just the big picture. It’s about progress, not perfection.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Learning and adapting takes time. I’m proud of you for being open to these strategies. Remember, it’s normal to encounter setbacks, but each step forward is worth celebrating. 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared to tackle this. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I believe you’ve got this. If you find yourself struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out. Shall we set a time for our next session to discuss your experiences? 

User: Yes, let’s do that! I’m looking forward to sharing how it goes.

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Just remember to be kind to yourself along the way. Until next time, take care and good luck!

User: Thank you so much! I will do my best.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li. Welcome to our session today. I appreciate you being here. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi, I've been feeling pretty down. I tried to talk to my classmates in the dorm, but I got really nervous and it didn't go well. Now I feel even more isolated and confused about how to connect with them.

Consultant: I understand that feeling nervous can make socializing quite challenging, especially when you want to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were running through your mind when you attempted to talk to them?

User: I kept thinking that I'd embarrass myself or that they wouldn't want to talk to me. It made me freeze up and not know what to say.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite powerful and made it difficult for you to engage. When you think, "I'll embarrass myself," what emotions do you experience?

User: I feel anxious and sad. It's like there’s this pressure to fit in, but I feel like I’m just not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in, feeling anxious and like you don't belong. Let's explore a bit—do you think these thoughts might be a little extreme? For instance, is there evidence that suggests your classmates wouldn't want to talk to you?

User: I guess I don't actually know how they feel. Maybe they're also shy or nervous. I just assumed they wouldn't like me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Li. While it’s easy to jump to conclusions, there's often more to the story. What if you shifted your perspective? How might you see this situation differently?

User: Maybe I could think that they might be open to talking, or that it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly. I could just try again.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Embracing the possibility of a positive interaction can help reduce that pressure. Would it be helpful to identify a small, specific situation where you might practice this new thought?

User: Yes, I could try just saying hello to one person next time. That seems manageable.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a perfect starting point. Let’s also consider how to prepare for that moment. How would you like to feel when you approach someone?

User: I want to feel relaxed and just be myself, instead of worrying so much.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal. How about we think of a few calming strategies you could use beforehand to help you feel more relaxed?

User: I could take a deep breath, or remind myself it’s just a simple hello, nothing too big.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Taking deep breaths can be really grounding. Let's also practice saying your opening line. What would you say as you approach someone?

User: I might say, “Hi, I’m Li. How are you?” Sounds simple enough.

Consultant: It's simple and effective! Remember, even if things don’t go perfectly, it’s still an opportunity to connect. How do you feel about trying this in the coming week?

User: I feel a little nervous but also excited to give it a shot. It feels nice to have a plan.

Consultant: Fantastic! Having a plan can definitely make a difference. Let’s also set a goal for this week. How about talking to at least one new person?

User: Yes, I can commit to that. Just one person seems doable.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m really proud of you for taking this step. Before we finish today, let’s reflect on what you hope to achieve with this experience. What do you want to learn from it?

User: I think I want to feel a sense of connection and maybe gain a little confidence. It would be nice to feel like I belong.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful aspiration. Gaining confidence through connection can definitely reinforce your sense of belonging. We can keep this as our focus moving forward. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel encouraged. Talking through everything helps, and having these strategies makes me feel more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you're making progress, and each little step counts. Let's continue to build on these insights in our next session. If you face challenges, we can work through them together. 

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best this week and come back to share how it goes.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care of yourself, Li, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. Let's talk about how you're feeling and what you've experienced since our last session.

User: Hi! I’ve been reflecting a lot on my situation lately. I understand that I miss my home, but I also realize there are challenges in adapting to life in the city. It's been tough.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re gaining a better understanding of your feelings about home and the challenges you face. Can you share what specific challenges you've encountered in adjusting to city life?

User: I have trouble fitting in with my classmates. My accent is different, and I feel like they don't quite understand me. Sometimes, I feel really lonely despite being surrounded by people.

Consultant: Feeling lonely in a crowd can be really difficult. It's understandable that your accent might be a barrier in social settings. Have there been any moments, perhaps when you met your friend from home, that made you feel more connected or at ease?

User: Yes, actually! When I met my friend at the library, I felt a sense of relief for that short time. It made me realize that I can connect with others, but then it quickly turned into remembering how isolated I've felt.

Consultant: That meeting seems to have sparked some hope for you. It’s interesting how a familiar connection can provide comfort, even if briefly. How did that interaction make you think about your potential to connect with others here?

User: It makes me think that maybe I should try harder to build relationships. But then, I worry they won't accept me as I am or that I'll just embarrass myself.

Consultant: It's natural to have those concerns. It might help to remember that everyone has their own insecurities, often more than we realize. Can you think of a time when you tried to reach out to someone and what that experience felt like for you?

User: I once tried to join a study group, but I felt too anxious to share my opinions. I ended up just listening, and it felt like I didn't belong.

Consultant: I can see why that would leave you feeling excluded. Perhaps we can explore ways to approach situations like this differently next time. What could make you feel more comfortable contributing to a group?

User: Maybe if I prepared some points ahead of time, it would help. But what if they still don’t engage with me?

Consultant: Preparing can definitely boost your confidence. But think about this: if a friend or classmate were to share their thoughts and felt nervous, how would you respond to them? 

User: I would probably encourage them and let them know their ideas matter.

Consultant: Exactly! You might find that others feel the same way and would appreciate your input. Let’s set some goals together to increase your comfort in social situations. What’s one specific action you can take to reach out to people?

User: I could try to join a club related to my interests. That might help me meet people with similar hobbies.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can make it easier to connect with others. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also excited at the thought of meeting new people who share my interests.

Consultant: That mix of emotions is completely normal! Establishing this kind of connection can gradually help reduce your feelings of loneliness. How can we prepare you for your first meeting?

User: Maybe I could write down a few conversation starters or questions to ask others to help break the ice.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! It can empower you to facilitate conversations. As you think about that, let’s also explore how you can balance your feelings for home with your experiences here. What aspects of home do you miss the most?

User: I miss the warmth of my family and the simplicity of life there. It feels like everything is faster-paced here.

Consultant: It’s understandable to miss that warmth. What if you considered incorporating aspects of home into your current life? For example, perhaps cooking a family recipe or sharing stories with friends?

User: That could help! I would love to share my culture with others. It might even spark more conversations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your culture can be a beautiful way to connect with others. Plus, it reinforces where you come from while navigating your new life. Let’s work on how you can blend these experiences into your daily routine.

User: I could cook a meal for my new classmates and invite them over. That would bring everyone together!

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Hosting a meal could be a great way to share your background with them while also creating space for friendships to grow. How do you feel thinking about taking that step?

User: I feel more confident now. It seems exciting rather than daunting. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Confidence often grows with small steps. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway that resonates with you from our conversation?

User: I realize that I can take small actions to connect with others without losing my sense of home. I can embrace both parts of my life.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Li. Balancing your past and present is essential. As you explore these connections, remember that progress takes time. I’m here to support you on this journey. Let’s review what you'll focus on until we meet next.

User: Working on preparing conversation starters and planning to invite classmates over for a meal.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your experience in our next session. Remember, it's okay to feel a bit anxious—taking these steps is already a big achievement. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling more confident and experiencing some joy in your university life. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve participated in some club activities, and it’s been a really positive experience. I feel more accepted and like I belong. But sometimes, I still revert to feeling lonely or unsure about my abilities.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear about your positive experiences in the clubs and feeling more accepted! It’s also normal to have moments of self-doubt, especially when facing new challenges. Can you tell me more about when you feel lonely or uncertain about your abilities?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm in a group, I feel like they are all much better than I am, especially when they talk about their experiences and skills. I start to think maybe I’m not good enough, which makes me want to withdraw.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be experiencing some negative thoughts about your abilities compared to others. When you think you’re not good enough, what emotions do you typically feel?

User: I feel anxious and a bit ashamed. I wish I could just be like them, but I don’t know how to match their energy or skills. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and shame can be really challenging to deal with. It’s important to recognize that everyone has unique strengths. What do you think is contributing to those thoughts of comparison and feeling frustrated?

User: I guess it’s mostly because I want to fit in and be well-liked, but I feel like I’m still adapting to everything. Sometimes, I feel that my background makes me different from others.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re in a new environment. Remember, your background contributes to who you are, and that can be a strength. Can you reflect on how your experiences growing up have shaped you in a positive way?

User: I’ve always been determined and hardworking. I think those traits help me push through challenges. I just worry they aren’t enough in my new environment.

Consultant: Those qualities of determination and hard work are indeed valuable. Let’s explore how you can use them to build your confidence further. Could we try to set some gradual goals for yourself that align with your strengths?

User: Yes, I think setting small goals could help. Maybe something related to participating in discussions in class or sharing my perspective more often?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Participating in discussions can help boost your confidence and connect with other students. How about aiming to share at least one thought or idea in class each week? 

User: That sounds doable! I can try to prepare a bit before class to make me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Preparing ahead is a smart strategy. Also, remember that it’s perfectly okay to have moments of hesitation; what matters is that you’re taking steps to engage. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited! It’s a manageable goal, and I think it will help me practice being more confident in class.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! It’s wonderful to set yourself up for success. Let’s also consider ways to celebrate your achievements, even the small ones. How would you like to acknowledge your progress?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to note down my thoughts and the progress I make each week. It might help me see how far I’ve come.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reflection of your growth and allow you to identify patterns in your thoughts and emotions over time. How do you think it will feel to look back at your experiences in a few weeks?

User: I think it will be encouraging to see my development. It might help me build more self-belief as I read about my journey.

Consultant: Exactly! Tracking your progress will help reinforce your positive changes. Let’s make sure to review your journal together in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today?

User: I think that covers everything for now. I really appreciate your support and guidance!

Consultant: I'm glad to support you! Remember, these steps are about gradual growth. As you continue to apply these strategies, your confidence will increase, and you’ll navigate through challenges more smoothly. Before our next meeting, keep focusing on those small goals, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll do my best and can’t wait to share my progress with you.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to hear about your journey. Remember, you’ve got this, and I’ll see you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. I'm eager to hear about your experiences since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident after participating in the exhibition. It was a little challenging, but I received some positive feedback from my peers and mentor, which really boosted my spirits.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience had a significant impact on your confidence. What specific aspects of the feedback made you feel more optimistic about your university life?

User: I think it was the recognition of my efforts and the encouragement from others. I realized that I can contribute meaningfully, and it felt nice to be valued by my peers.

Consultant: Feeling valued can be incredibly affirming, especially in a new environment. How do you think this experience has influenced your approach to the challenges you faced previously, like adapting to a different learning style or social interactions?

User: I feel like I'm gradually getting the hang of things. I still struggle sometimes, but now I’m more open to reaching out to classmates for help rather than isolating myself.

Consultant: That's a big step forward! Openly reaching out for support can help strengthen your connections with others. Can you elaborate on any recent experiences where you've taken this initiative to connect with your classmates?

User: I recently formed a study group for one of my classes. It was a little intimidating at first, but everyone was really friendly, and we helped each other out with our assignments.

Consultant: Fantastic! Forming a study group can really enhance your learning and foster a sense of belonging. How did participating in that group make you feel about yourself and your capabilities?

User: I felt empowered and appreciated. It showed me that I can be a part of something, and I’m capable of helping others too.

Consultant: That’s such a positive realization! It seems like you’re actively reshaping how you view yourself in this new environment. What would you like to work on next to continue building on these achievements and maintain this confidence?

User: I want to set more personal goals for improvements, like participating in more class discussions and maybe even joining another club.

Consultant: Setting personal goals is a great way to leverage your newfound confidence! How do you envision taking the next steps to participate more actively in class and join another club? 

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to share my thoughts in class and that everyone is here to learn together. As for clubs, I’ll look for something that aligns with my interests to make it less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Recognizing that everyone is there to learn can ease some pressure. What specific clubs or activities have caught your interest so far?

User: I'm interested in the literature club because I love reading and discussing books. It seems like a welcoming environment.

Consultant: The literature club sounds like a fantastic fit for you! Engaging in discussions around something you love can further enhance your comfort levels in social interactions. How do you feel about taking the step to join this club?

User: I'm excited but also a bit nervous about introducing myself to new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in new social situations. Maybe you could practice a simple introduction or ask a member about the club before formally joining. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I think just discussing it with someone there might help me feel more at ease when I join.

Consultant: Great strategy! Preparing can build your confidence as well. Reflecting on our discussion, how would you summarize the progress you've made since we started our sessions together?

User: I’ve become more confident in myself and my abilities. I actively seek social interactions now instead of avoiding them, and it’s made a big difference in how I feel at university.

Consultant: You’ve highlighted some incredible growth! Recognizing your progress really solidifies that you can continue on this path. Do you have any strategies in mind for maintaining this positive momentum in the future?

User: I’ll try to keep challenging myself with new goals and remind myself of my achievements whenever I doubt myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! Setting and challenging yourself while reflecting on your achievements will help you sustain your growth. As we wrap up, how have you felt about our sessions together and the insights you’ve gained?

User: I’ve found our sessions very beneficial. They helped me recognize my growth and gave me valuable tools to navigate my challenges.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It’s been a privilege to support you on this journey. As we conclude our sessions, remember that you’ve built a foundation of skills and insights you can rely on. Should you feel the need for any further guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you all the best in your personal development and new experiences. Take care and remember to celebrate your achievements along the way!
