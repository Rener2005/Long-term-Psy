Consultant: Hello, Zheng! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been really struggling. I'm feeling a lot of intense emotions because of some issues with my relationship with a junior. It's causing me to feel anxious and quite sensitive about my interactions with others.

Consultant: I can see how that would be very challenging for you. It sounds like these issues have been quite overwhelming. Can you share a bit more about what specifically has been troubling you in this relationship?

User: Well, we had a disagreement recently, and I felt really hurt and confused. I worry that maybe I’m not good enough or that I might be pushing him away.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hurt and to worry about your worth in a relationship, especially when disagreements happen. It seems like this situation is making you question yourself. How does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really insecure. I get anxious thinking about talking to him, and it’s just so frustrating because I want things to improve, but I don’t know how.

Consultant: That feeling of insecurity can be really tough to deal with. You mentioned wanting to improve things—what would that look like for you? How would you feel if that anxiety were less intense?

User: I would feel more confident and relaxed. I want to be able to communicate with him without feeling so anxious or worried about his reactions.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Being able to communicate without anxiety would make a big difference. Let’s explore some of the thoughts you have when you think about talking to him. What goes through your mind?

User: I often think that he’ll judge me negatively or that I’ll mess things up. It's like I just expect the worst.

Consultant: It sounds like you're anticipating negative outcomes, which is quite common in situations like this. Can we identify how these thoughts impact your emotions and behavior? When you think he’ll judge you negatively, how does that affect how you feel?

User: I feel really tense and panicky. It makes me want to avoid him instead of talking it out.

Consultant: Avoidance is a common response to anxiety. When you want to avoid the situation, it might provide temporary relief, but it can also keep you stuck. Let's challenge those negative thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that he will judge you negatively?

User: I guess I don't have solid proof. It’s mostly just my fears and insecurities talking.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Understanding that these fears might not be rooted in reality is the first step in challenging them. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them?

User: I think I would tell them to not assume the worst and to just express how they feel.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! It sounds like you have a good understanding of what you might suggest to a friend, which can also apply to yourself. Would practicing this advice make you feel more prepared to approach him?

User: Maybe. I’d have to try to remind myself that it’s okay to express how I'm feeling.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s talk about some ways you could express those feelings and communicate openly. What do you think could be a good starting point for your conversation with him?

User: I think I could start by just being honest about how I felt after our disagreement and ask him how he feels too.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Being honest can open the door for dialogue. How might you phrase that when the moment arises?

User: I could say something like, “I felt really hurt after our last conversation, and I’d like to talk about it. How do you feel about what happened?”

Consultant: That’s a great start, Zheng! It conveys your feelings and invites him to share his. Practicing this kind of communication can help reduce anxiety over time. How does that make you feel at the moment?

User: It makes me feel a bit relieved to think about it, but I’m still worried about how he’ll respond.

Consultant: It's normal to feel apprehensive, but remember that you are taking a positive step by preparing to communicate. What strategies do you think might help you cope with those worries if they arise?

User: I could try deep breathing or remind myself that I won’t know until I talk to him.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can calm your anxiety, and reminding yourself that you can't predict the outcome can help reduce the pressure to get it right. What's another technique you could utilize to support your emotional state during this process?

User: I could write down my feelings before talking to him, so I have a clearer idea of what I want to say.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! Writing can help clarify your feelings and thoughts. It also gives you an opportunity to organize what you want to express. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I’ve learned that it’s important to challenge my negative thoughts and communicate openly. I also have some strategies to manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Acknowledging your feelings and preparing for communication are powerful steps. Remember these strategies as you move forward. I believe you can manage your emotions and improve your relationship. If you feel stuck, don't hesitate to reach out again. How are you feeling about ending our session today?

User: I feel hopeful, but also a bit nervous about actually applying what we talked about.

Consultant: It's totally normal to feel that way, but remember, progress takes time. You now have tools to help you along the way. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care, Zheng!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zheng! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we talked about your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt in communication. How are you feeling now, especially in relation to your boyfriend?

User: Hi. I still feel a bit anxious. We had another conversation, and it didn't go well again. I tried to express my feelings, but I think I just made things worse. I don’t know how to communicate without causing misunderstandings.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Zheng. It sounds frustrating to feel that your attempts to communicate are not landing as you hoped. Can you tell me more about what happened during that conversation? What were you trying to communicate?

User: I wanted to explain how my anxiety affects me and that I didn’t mean to pull away. But somehow my words just made him feel confused or upset. I feel like I keep failing to express what I really feel.

Consultant: It sounds like you were trying to be open, but the message didn’t come across as intended. This can be really discouraging. What thoughts went through your mind during and after that conversation? 

User: I kept thinking that I must be really bad at communicating. Maybe I'm just not capable of expressing myself. It makes me feel even more anxious and frustrated.

Consultant: I can see how that thought can be quite heavy for you, Zheng. It seems you're judging your communication efforts quite harshly. What would happen if you viewed this as a learning process instead of a failure? 

User: I guess it could help, but it's hard not to think I'm failing when things don't go right. I don’t want to keep upsetting him.

Consultant: That's understandable. It’s natural to feel a sense of urgency in wanting to fix things. However, what if we explore some alternative ways to express yourself? For example, are there any specific phrases or strategies you could use that might help clarify your thoughts in the future?

User: I have thought about maybe writing down what I want to say before talking, to organize my thoughts better. But I worry that it would feel awkward.

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts can be a great strategy! It can help you articulate your feelings more clearly. It doesn't have to feel awkward; it can be just a tool to ensure you convey your message. How do you think your boyfriend would react if you shared that you want to try this approach?

User: He might appreciate the effort, but I'm just not sure. I fear he might feel like I'm distancing myself instead of being open.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Zheng. How about you frame it in a way that shows you’re actively trying to engage better and that you value your relationship? You might say something like, "I want to make sure I express my feelings clearly because you matter to me." How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds good! I can see how that would show him that I care. I'll try to remind myself of that before talking.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like you might be shifting towards a more constructive mindset. Remember, it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly. Each conversation is a chance to learn. Can you think of a situation where you could practice this technique soon?

User: I think I could try it during our next phone call. I usually get anxious thinking about it, but maybe being prepared will help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Preparation can really help reduce anxiety. As we build communication skills, we can also examine any negative thoughts that arise. If you feel anxious before the call, what might be some alternative thoughts you could remind yourself?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s just practice, and it’s okay if it’s not perfect. Everyone struggles with communication sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself that it’s a learning experience can ease some pressure. What strategies can you put in place to help combat those anxious thoughts if they arise during the call?

User: I could take deep breaths or even remind myself of those positive thoughts I just came up with. It would help to stay calm and focused.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Zheng! Using breathing techniques and positive self-talk can create a calmer state during your conversation. Before we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned about your communication so far?

User: I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself about my communication skills. I plan to try those strategies we discussed, and I feel a bit better about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s all about progress rather than perfection. Remember, take it one step at a time, and be patient with yourself. As we conclude for today, how do you feel about implementing these strategies?

User: I feel hopeful! I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to give it a try. Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zheng. It’s great to see your willingness to try again. I'll be here to support you through this process. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how things go during our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zheng! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply what we discussed about handling misunderstandings in communication. But sometimes, my emotions still get the best of me when challenges arise.

Consultant: I understand that it's quite a journey to work on emotional regulation during challenging conversations. Can you share an example where you felt your emotions fluctuated recently?

User: Sure. Just the other day, I was trying to explain my point of view to a classmate, but they seemed to misunderstand me. I felt frustrated and a bit overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you put effort into expressing yourself. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment when you felt misunderstood?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I’m not communicating clearly enough, or that I’m just not good at expressing my feelings.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Sometimes, those negative thoughts can really affect how we perceive ourselves in conversations. Could we explore how those thoughts made you feel emotionally?

User: Yes, it made me feel anxious, and I ended up shutting down instead of continuing the conversation.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment led to you feeling stuck. Let’s identify those thoughts about not being a good communicator. How often do you find yourself thinking that, and what evidence do you have to support or challenge that belief?

User: I realize I think like that quite often, but I haven't really considered if it's true. I have successfully communicated with others before, at least some of the time.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to acknowledge those successes. What if we tried to replace that negative thought with a more balanced one? For instance, instead of “I’m not good at expressing my feelings,” maybe we could say, “I am improving my communication skills, and it's okay to make mistakes.”

User: That sounds like a more helpful perspective. I can see how that might help ease my anxiety in the moment.

Consultant: I'm glad you see that! Let’s think about how you might use that new thought in real-life situations. Next time you face a misunderstanding, what could you say to yourself to help keep calm?

User: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that I’m trying my best. That way, I might not feel as overwhelmed if there’s a misunderstanding.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Practicing that self-talk can really help stabilize your emotions. Have you thought about any specific scenarios where you could practice this new approach?

User: Yes, I’ve got a group project to discuss soon. I can use this as a chance to test my new approach.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Remember, it’s okay to have some nervousness. Embrace it and use your techniques. How do you feel about approaching that conversation?

User: I feel a bit more confident now, knowing I have a plan. I want to try to stay calm and focus on expressing clearly.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! And if something goes off track, it’s a chance to learn. What could be a good first step in your communication during that group project?

User: I could start by summarizing my understanding of the project and ask for feedback. This way, we can avoid misunderstandings right from the start.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Engaging others early on can help set a collaborative tone. How do you feel about sharing your ideas confidently, knowing you are practicing a positive mindset?

User: It feels reassuring! I already feel a bit more excited about contributing to the group.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, each step you take reinforces your skills. Finally, let’s recap what you’ve learned today and how you can apply it in future situations.

User: Today, I learned to challenge negative thoughts about my communication skills and to replace them with supportive thoughts. I also have a plan for my upcoming group project.

Consultant: Exactly. You’re seeing progress in maintaining a positive self-view. Have you thought about any long-term goals for your communication skills?

User: I want to keep improving and feel more confident expressing my emotions and ideas, especially in larger groups.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! You’re already on the right path. As we wrap up, remember to give yourself credit for your efforts. I believe in your capacity to manage emotions and communicate effectively. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel much better equipped to handle challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm excited for you and the progress you’ve made. Anytime you need to talk again, feel free to reach out.

User: I will, thank you! I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm excited to hear about your recent experiences. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better actually. I've been able to use my new communication skills during our team project, and I've noticed that my relationships with classmates have improved.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It's wonderful to hear that you've gained a sense of achievement from improving your interactions. How does it feel to connect with your classmates in a new way?

User: It feels really rewarding. I used to struggle with expressing myself, but now I feel more confident and comfortable during conversations. It's like a weight has been lifted.

Consultant: It sounds like these skills are making a real difference for you. What specific communication techniques have you been able to apply?

User: I’ve been practicing active listening and asking more open-ended questions. I think these have helped me engage more with others.

Consultant: Active listening and asking open-ended questions are excellent tools for building connections. Have you noticed any situations where you felt particularly proud of how you communicated?

User: Yes, during a recent group discussion, I was able to encourage others to share their ideas. I felt like I was contributing positively to the team atmosphere.

Consultant: That’s a great example of using your skills to foster a supportive environment. How did that make you feel in terms of your confidence?

User: It made me feel really proud of myself. I realized that I can lead conversations instead of just listening. It’s a big change for me.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! Leading conversations indicates your growing confidence. What would you like to focus on today in terms of continuing to build these skills?

User: I want to practice using these communication techniques in more social situations, especially when meeting new people.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing in new social settings can really enhance your comfort level. How do you usually feel when meeting new people?

User: I often feel anxious, like I don't know what to say or how to keep the conversation going. I hope to overcome that.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, and it’s great that you recognize it. Let’s explore some strategies we can use to help you feel more at ease in those situations.

User: That would be helpful. I'm not sure how to handle the pressure of introducing myself or starting conversations.

Consultant: One effective method is to prepare a few introductory questions or topics that can serve as conversation starters. What are some things you might feel comfortable discussing with new people?

User: I usually enjoy talking about school, but I’m not sure if that’s interesting enough. 

Consultant: Talking about school is a great topic! Many people can relate. You could also share experiences from your team project since they might find that engaging. Would you like to role-play a conversation starter with me?

User: Yes, I’d love that! How should I start?

Consultant: You could begin with something simple like, “Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I noticed we’re in the same class. What do you think about the recent project?” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I can definitely try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice. You can start the conversation as if we're meeting for the first time.

User: Hi, I’m Zheng. I noticed we’re in the same class. What do you think about the recent project?

Consultant: Hi, Zheng! I think the project was really interesting. I enjoyed working with the team. What about you? What did you like about it?

User: I felt good about how we collaborated! It was nice to see everyone contributing their ideas.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful response! You’re keeping the conversation flowing and encouraging further discussion. How do you feel executing this?

User: I feel a bit nervous but excited that I can keep it going!

Consultant: That’s a natural feeling. The more you practice, the more natural it will become. How do you think you can prepare for this kind of exchange in real life?

User: Maybe I can write down a few questions beforehand, just as a reminder.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Having questions prepared can help you feel more confident. Is there a specific social situation you would like to try this in soon?

User: I have a gathering with classmates coming up this weekend, so I can use these techniques there.

Consultant: Perfect! That will be a great opportunity to practice. Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit anxious at first. What steps will you take to remind yourself of your skills during the gathering?

User: I’ll try to stay calm and remember that it's about connecting and sharing, not just performing.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset to have. Focusing on connection will shift your perspective. How can you ensure that you maintain that mindset during the event?

User: I think I can take a few deep breaths beforehand and remind myself of my recent successes.

Consultant: Absolutely, deep breaths can help you center yourself. Reflecting on your successes will boost your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared and optimistic about this gathering now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made great progress. To wrap up, how do you feel about the skills you've developed and the growth you've experienced lately?

User: I’m really satisfied. I've seen improvement in my social interactions and feel encouraged to keep building on these experiences.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, you’ve built a solid foundation to lean on as you continue your personal growth. I believe you will thrive in your interactions. 

User: Thank you for your support! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to help anytime. I wish you all the best in your upcoming gathering and look forward to hearing about it next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zheng! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your relationships and emotional growth?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. After resolving the conflicts with my boyfriend, I realized how important understanding and support are in a relationship. It makes me feel more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some positive strides in your relationship. Can you share more about what changes you've noticed in yourself or your interactions since then?

User: Well, I've become more open in expressing my feelings. I feel more confident in communicating what I need. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It sounds like you're finding your voice, which is a significant step. How has this change affected your overall feelings or confidence in social situations?

User: I think it's helped me feel more secure. I don’t feel as anxious during conversations anymore. I feel like I'm growing as a person and becoming more comfortable with myself.

Consultant: That's an important realization. Growing comfortable with yourself often translates to more confidence in relationships with others. What do you think are the key factors contributing to this growth?

User: I believe it's partly due to the support I've received from my boyfriend and the internal reflection I've been doing. I'm learning to appreciate myself more.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you recognize the role of support and self-appreciation. Self-reflection is a powerful tool. Moving forward, how do you envision continuing this growth in your emotional and social life?

User: I think setting some long-term goals would be helpful. I want to maintain this confidence and deepen my relationships with friends and family.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting long-term goals can help keep your growth on track. Have you thought about what specific goals you might want to set for yourself in this area?

User: Maybe I could aim to plan regular catch-ups with friends and work on expressing myself honestly when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Regular catch-ups can strengthen your bonds, and open communication will enhance your relationships. How do you feel about integrating these practices into your routine?

User: I feel excited! I want to build these connections more genuinely. It feels rewarding just thinking about it.

Consultant: Feeling excited is a great indicator of motivation! What potential challenges do you think you might face while trying to maintain these routines and goals?

User: I guess I worry about falling back into my old habits of avoiding deep conversations. Sometimes it feels easier just to keep things light.

Consultant: It's normal to have concerns about slipping back into old patterns. What strategies can we develop together to help you overcome those challenges and encourage deeper conversations?

User: Perhaps I could prepare some topics in advance to discuss with my friends. That way, I'd have a direction to follow if I feel stuck.

Consultant: Preparing topics sounds like a pragmatic approach to spark discussions. Would you like to brainstorm some topics together that you feel comfortable diving into?

User: Yes! I’d love that. I think talking about our experiences and feelings as we navigate life changes could be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing life experiences can open the door for deeper connections. How about also setting a goal to initiate one of these conversations in the coming week?

User: That sounds doable! I’ll try to reach out to a friend and suggest we talk over coffee.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s a small step, but it can lead to significant breakthroughs in your connections. How do you envision feeling after that conversation?

User: I expect to feel relieved and maybe a bit vulnerable, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It might help solidify our friendship.

Consultant: Embracing vulnerability can indeed strengthen relationships. It shows authenticity. What will you do to remind yourself of your progress and growth after these interactions?

User: I think I could keep a journal to reflect on my feelings and how each conversation went. It might help me notice patterns and stay motivated.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful strategy for self-reflection! It will allow you to track your thoughts and feelings as you progress. How do you feel about starting this journaling practice?

User: I'm excited about it! I’ve always wanted to keep a journal but never got around to it. This seems like the perfect purpose to start.

Consultant: It sure is! Setting intentions around your journaling can greatly enhance your experience. As we wrap up today’s session, what emotions are you currently experiencing regarding your personal growth?

User: I feel hopeful and inspired. This conversation has really helped me clarify my thoughts and plans.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zheng! It's clear you're making meaningful changes. Remember, it’s essential to recognize and celebrate these small victories as you continue to grow. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we conclude?

User: I just want to thank you for the guidance. I feel more equipped to tackle my goals now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you on this journey. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Keep believing in yourself, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zheng! I'm glad to see you again today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. My self-esteem has improved, and I’ve been more confident in my interactions with others. I’m excited about the new semester and the plans I have!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress in your emotional well-being and social interactions. What specific improvements have you noticed?

User: I’ve been participating more in class discussions, and I've made an effort to reach out to classmates. I feel less anxious about speaking up.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Engaging in class discussions can be a great way to enhance learning and build connections. How does it feel to experience this newfound confidence?

User: It feels empowering! I used to hesitate a lot, but now I feel like my voice matters. It’s nice to share my thoughts without worrying too much.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling empowered! What are some of the plans you have for this semester in terms of participation and engagement?

User: I’m planning to join a couple of clubs. I think it will be a good opportunity to meet new people and develop my skills.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Joining clubs can provide you with opportunities for personal growth and social interaction. What are the clubs you're interested in?

User: There’s a debate club and an art society that I’m thinking about. I’ve always enjoyed art, and debating might help me practice speaking up even more.

Consultant: Both clubs sound like excellent choices! They align well with your goals of improving communication and making new friends. How do you feel about stepping out of your comfort zone to join these activities?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and a bit of nervousness. It’s new territory for me, but I want to challenge myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about new experiences, especially when challenging yourself. What strategies do you think you could use to manage that nervousness as you embark on these new activities?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous, and that everyone else is probably just as anxious. Maybe I could practice my speaking skills a bit before meetings, too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Acknowledging your feelings and preparing in advance can make a big difference. How do you think this approach will impact your overall experience in these clubs?

User: I think it will help me feel more grounded and less overwhelmed. Practicing beforehand might boost my confidence during actual meetings.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Zheng. Practicing can certainly increase your comfort level. As you think about joining these clubs and engaging more with others, is there any other area in your life where you would like to see improvement?

User: I’d like to work on managing my time better since balancing study, club activities, and social life can be a challenge.

Consultant: Time management is an important skill, especially when balancing multiple commitments. What techniques have you tried in the past to manage your time, and how successful were they?

User: I usually make to-do lists, but I often struggle to stick to them. Sometimes I get distracted easily.

Consultant: To-do lists can be helpful, but it’s also important to prioritize tasks and set specific timeframes for each. Have you considered breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces?

User: No, I haven’t tried that. I usually just write down everything at once. That might help me focus better.

Consultant: Breaking tasks down can make them feel less overwhelming and give you a clear path to follow. Would it be helpful if we worked together on developing a time management plan for you?

User: Yes, I’d appreciate that! Having a plan would definitely help me stay organized and on track.

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline your commitments, such as classes, club meetings, and any study time. We can also identify specific goals for each week, making adjustments as necessary. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel more confident with a structured plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to adjust the plan as you go. Flexibility can be important too. Now, looking back at your recent progress and upcoming plans, what do you believe your biggest takeaway from our sessions has been?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is recognizing my self-worth and understanding that I can improve in areas that used to scare me. That realization itself is motivating!

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Zheng! Acknowledging your self-worth is key to personal development. As we wrap up our session, I want to remind you that you’ve made great strides. What will you focus on in the coming weeks to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I’ll focus on joining the clubs, managing my time effectively, and remembering my progress when I feel nervous or overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are excellent intentions! Stay committed to your goals, and remember that you can always reflect on your progress. If you need support along the way, you can always reach out. I believe in your ability to keep growing.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zheng! It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I look forward to hearing about your successes in our next session. Take care!
