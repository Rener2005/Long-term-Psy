Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you decided to come in today. It sounds like you've been experiencing some intense feelings recently. Can you share what has been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling very anxious, especially when it comes to speaking in front of groups. It makes me feel so nervous and sometimes I even stutter. I really want to feel more confident and express myself better.

Consultant: It sounds like public speaking has become quite challenging for you. You're looking to feel more at ease and confident when expressing your thoughts in front of others. How long have you been feeling this way?

User: It's been building up since I started college a few months ago. Participating in group activities makes me really uncomfortable, and I dread having to speak up.

Consultant: I understand how overwhelming that can be. College can be a big adjustment, especially with social interactions. Can you tell me more about a specific situation where you've felt particularly anxious when speaking?

User: Last week during a class discussion, I was called upon to speak, and I completely froze. My mind went blank, and I felt everyone was staring at me. It was really embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds like a very stressful experience. It's completely understandable to feel anxious in such situations. When you were in that moment, what thoughts went through your mind?

User: I thought that everyone would judge me for not knowing what to say, and that I would look stupid. I felt like I let everyone down.

Consultant: It's tough when those kinds of thoughts creep in. It seems like you might have been experiencing some negative thinking patterns in that moment. Can we explore how those thoughts affected your feelings and behavior?

User: Yes, definitely. I felt really embarrassed and anxious, which made it even harder to speak. I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough. When you think about it, how do you think those thoughts about being judged affect your self-esteem and willingness to participate in the future?

User: I think they make me want to avoid speaking even more. If I can just stay quiet, then I won’t embarrass myself.

Consultant: Avoidance can provide temporary relief but might reinforce those anxious feelings over time. What do you think would happen if you challenged those thoughts about judgment and embarrassment? 

User: I guess if I told myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, it might be easier to speak up. But I still worry about how others perceive me. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! What evidence do you have that supports those fears, and is there any evidence that contradicts them? 

User: Well, I suppose most of my classmates have been supportive, and they seem to understand. Sometimes they even share their own struggles.

Consultant: Yes, it sounds like your classmates can relate to your experiences, which is a reminder that everyone has their challenges. How might this understanding change the way you view speaking in front of them? 

User: Maybe I should see them as friends rather than an audience. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a very positive shift in perspective! Let's try applying this approach next time you have to speak in class. Would you be open to practicing some relaxation techniques to help with the anxiety leading up to those moments?

User: That sounds helpful. What kind of techniques do you suggest?

Consultant: We could try deep breathing exercises or visualization techniques. For instance, you can imagine a scenario where you feel confident and supported while speaking. Would you like to start with some deep breathing now?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think it could help me feel calmer.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment to breathe deeply together. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale gently through your mouth. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels nice to take a moment to breathe. I feel a little more relaxed already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging in these exercises regularly can help you manage anxiety effectively. As we continue to work together, let’s focus on identifying those automatic negative thoughts and finding ways to challenge them. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I want to feel more in control of my thoughts and emotions during these situations.

Consultant: Excellent! Recognizing your thoughts is a key step in this process. As we move forward, can you think of any particular thoughts during public speaking that you’d like to tackle in our next session?

User: I’d like to work on the thought that everyone is judging me harshly. 

Consultant: Sure, we can definitely explore that thought next time. Before our session ends today, let’s summarize what we've talked about and set some goals for you to work on. What do you feel you’ve gained from our conversation today?

User: I’ve realized that I can challenge my negative thoughts, and I have some tools to help manage my anxiety when speaking. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! It’s important to acknowledge those insights and the steps you’re taking. Looking ahead, how might you use what we discussed in your next speaking situation?

User: I’ll try to remember that my classmates can relate and focus on my breathing. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking to challenge your anxiety. Remember, it's a process, and it’s okay to feel nervous. I look forward to hearing how it goes for you next time. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those techniques, and we’ll continue to build on this in our next session. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last time together?

User: Hi! I’ve been okay, but I still feel a lot of anxiety when it comes to speaking up in class. I notice that my heart races, and sometimes I can't think of what to say.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still experiencing significant anxiety during class discussions. Let's talk more about that. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: Well, I often think that everyone is judging me, and I worry that if I say something wrong, it will be embarrassing. This thought makes me freeze up even more.

Consultant: I see. It seems like the belief that others are judging you is really impacting your ability to express yourself. Can you tell me more about the emotions that arise from those thoughts?

User: When I think that way, I feel a mix of fear and shame. It’s like I’m afraid of making a fool of myself, and then I feel ashamed of being so nervous.

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It can be tough to feel that way. Now, let's explore this further—do you think these thoughts are based on facts, or could they be distorted in some way?

User: I guess they might be a bit distorted. I mean, not everyone can be judging me at all times. But when I get nervous, it feels so real.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's common for our anxiety to amplify those fears, making them feel more valid than they actually are. Let's try to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that everyone is judging you when you speak up?

User: I don’t have much evidence—I mean, sometimes people are just listening or not paying attention. But it's hard to remember that when I'm up there.

Consultant: It makes sense that it's tough to recall that in the moment. Would it help to think about what you would tell a friend if they felt this way? 

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that most people are just curious about what others have to say.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows that you already know how to be kind to others, so now let's apply that kindness to yourself. What would it look like to practice that self-compassion during your next class discussion?

User: I guess I could remind myself to take a deep breath and that it’s okay not to be perfect. Maybe I could even prepare a few points beforehand to feel more secure.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! Preparing can definitely help ease some anxiety. Besides that, could you think of other ways to support yourself in those moments of anxiety?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking out in smaller groups first, to build my confidence gradually. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Starting with smaller settings can help build that confidence without the pressure of a larger audience. How does that make you feel about your next class?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful. I think if I keep practicing, I might feel less anxious over time.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Remember, progress doesn’t happen overnight, and practicing self-compassion during this process is key. How do you feel about those thoughts you had earlier about judgment and embarrassment?

User: I can see how they can be exaggerated. I think I can work on rephrasing those thoughts into something more supportive.

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing your thoughts is crucial for reducing anxiety. What’s one alternative thought you might use instead of thinking everyone is judging you?

User: Maybe I could think, “Everyone else is focused on their own contributions, and they’re probably just interested in what I have to say.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift! Focusing on the idea that others are engaged in the conversation can help alleviate some of that pressure. How would practicing this thought change your feelings before or during your next discussion?

User: I think it could help me feel less isolated and more engaged in the conversation. It might also reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That's great insight! Feeling more connected and engaged can certainly lessen the anxiety. As we wrap up today, let's summarize the strategies you've identified for managing your anxiety in class discussions.

User: I’ll prepare points in advance, practice speaking in smaller groups, and remind myself that others are not judging me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: Those are all wonderful strategies! You’re building a solid plan for yourself going forward. And remember, this journey is about progress, not perfection. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel much more equipped to handle my anxiety. I appreciate these strategies; they give me something to work on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're making significant progress in understanding and managing your anxiety. If you encounter any more challenges, remember you're not alone, and you can always reach out for support. 

User: Definitely! Thank you so much for the help today. I feel more confident moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I really appreciate your openness during our sessions. Keep practicing those new skills, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still have moments of anxiety, especially thinking about upcoming presentations. I just don't feel sure of myself.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve had moments of improvement, but I understand the anxiety is still lingering, particularly about presentations. Can you share what you're feeling specifically when you think about speaking in front of others?

User: When I think about presentations, my heart starts racing, and I feel this knot in my stomach. I keep doubting whether I’ll mess up or forget what I want to say.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It seems like there's a mix of physical sensations and thoughts of self-doubt. Let’s explore those thoughts. What specific thoughts come to mind during those moments?

User: I often think, “What if I forget everything?” or “Everyone will laugh at me if I mess up.” It makes me just want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really intense. It's understandable to feel that way when facing public speaking. Let's try to identify how those thoughts are impacting your emotions. How do those thoughts make you feel in the moment?

User: They make me feel anxious and stressed, like I can barely breathe. It feels like a lot of pressure to perform perfectly.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. Feeling pressure can be overwhelming. Now, let’s look at those thoughts more closely. Is there any evidence that supports those fears, like someone laughing at you?

User: I guess I don't have any proof that they would laugh. I think it’s just my fear getting the best of me.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that your fears might not reflect reality. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to reassure them about their presentation?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that people are usually understanding. Plus, it’s just one presentation, not the end of the world.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. Let’s try to apply that same self-compassion to you. How might it feel to remind yourself that it’s okay to be nervous, and that it’s just one part of your journey?

User: It would probably make the situation feel less daunting. I think I could be a bit kinder to myself about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a good step forward. Another way to ease some of that anxiety is by gradually facing the fear. Can we brainstorm smaller speaking opportunities you might feel comfortable with, maybe in a more relaxed setting?

User: Maybe I could try speaking up in small group discussions or even practice in front of my friends. That doesn’t feel as scary.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Starting with smaller groups can help you build confidence gradually. What would be a first step you could take this week toward engaging in a small group discussion?

User: I could bring up a topic during our study group and try to contribute more actively. Just thinking about it feels less intimidating than presenting to a class.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Engaging in that way can offer you a chance to practice speaking without the high stakes of a larger presentation. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited and a bit nervous, but mostly I think it’s doable. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that mix of excitement and nervousness! Let’s remind ourselves to celebrate those small victories. After your group discussion, we can review how it felt and what you learned. How do you think you can reward yourself afterward?

User: I could treat myself to some ice cream or something that I enjoy. 

Consultant: That sounds like a delightful reward! It’s important to acknowledge your efforts. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember about handling your anxiety moving forward?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to be nervous and that I can take small steps to improve without putting too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Remember, progress is about small steps. You’re doing great, and I’m proud of the efforts you're making. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more hopeful already. See you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I still get anxious sometimes, but I’ve noticed that my interactions in group studies have improved. It’s nice to receive positive feedback from my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress, which is great. What specific experiences have contributed to this feeling of improvement?

User: Well, during group discussions, I feel more comfortable sharing my thoughts. Before, I was always worried about being judged, but now I’m starting to relax a bit.

Consultant: It's impressive that you're feeling more relaxed in group discussions. It shows that you're building trust in your environment. What strategies do you think helped you feel this way?

User: I guess it’s just practicing more and getting used to speaking up. Plus, my classmates are really supportive.

Consultant: Supportive classmates can make a huge difference. It's encouraging to know that you found a positive space. What about the anxiety? Are there particular moments when you're still feeling anxious?

User: Sometimes I feel a little anxious before speaking, especially when it's a bigger group. I still hesitate at those moments.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s normal to feel anxious before speaking in larger groups. Let’s explore that a bit: what thoughts come to mind when you feel anxious before speaking?

User: I often think that I might embarrass myself or that my peers will judge what I say negatively.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed feel overwhelming. It sounds like there might be some cognitive distortions there—like catastrophizing. Can you see how those thoughts might not fully reflect reality?

User: Yes, I realize I might be making things worse in my head. It’s like I’m expecting the worst, even though I usually get positive feedback.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing those patterns is the first step. What alternative thoughts could you consider instead, especially when you feel that way before speaking?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve received good feedback before and that most people won’t judge me harshly. 

Consultant: That’s a much more balanced thought. How do you think that shift in perspective could influence your experience in those moments?

User: It might help me feel more confident and less worried about what others think. I can try to focus on sharing my ideas instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on your ideas can also help you shift away from the fear of judgment. Let's also talk about some relaxing techniques you could use beforehand. Have you tried any relaxation methods when feeling anxious?

User: I haven't really tried any specific techniques. I usually just try to breathe deeply.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great start! We can build on that. How about incorporating mindfulness into your routine? It could help ground you before speaking.

User: Mindfulness sounds interesting. How do I start practicing that?

Consultant: Mindfulness can be as simple as taking a few moments to focus on your breath or observing your thoughts without judgment. You could start with just a few minutes a day, focusing on how your body feels in the present moment. Would that be something you'd be willing to try?

User: Yes, I think I can manage that. It sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Trying out those techniques could empower you further. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. What strategies do you feel you're ready to implement in the upcoming days?

User: I will remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received, practice mindfulness, and focus more on sharing my ideas instead of worrying about judgment.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. You’re integrating these strategies to manage your anxiety better, which is a big step forward. Remember, it's okay to take small steps. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I'm feeling more hopeful about overcoming this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made significant progress, and it’s been great to see your transformation. Remember, if you ever feel uncertain, you can always come back to these strategies. 

User: Yes, I will. Thank you so much for today. I’ll keep practicing.

Consultant: You're welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello and welcome! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about things, actually. I tried some relaxation techniques during my recent study session, and it helped a little. But I still struggle with anxiety in public speaking situations.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you found some relief with relaxation techniques! Public speaking can be challenging for many people. Can you tell me more about the situations where you feel this anxiety the most?

User: I often feel nervous during group presentations or when I have to answer questions in class. My heart races, and I sometimes forget what I wanted to say. I wish I could just speak confidently without feeling so anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those situations are quite stressful for you. You mentioned wanting to speak confidently—what would that look like for you? How would you feel if you could express yourself without anxiety?

User: If I could speak confidently, I think I’d feel more in control and less embarrassed. Maybe I could even enjoy the interaction instead of dreading it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Let’s work towards that. Can we explore what thoughts go through your mind when you start feeling anxious before speaking? 

User: Usually, I start wondering if I will mess up or if others will judge me. I can’t help but think that everyone is just waiting for me to fail.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts, but I want to invite you to consider—how true are those thoughts? What evidence do you have that people are waiting for you to fail?

User: I guess I don’t really have strong evidence. It’s just how I feel in the moment. I realize I might be overthinking it.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Recognizing that those thoughts might not be completely accurate is a big step. What could be a more balanced way to view those situations?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that people are more focused on their own performance rather than judging me. They might even be supportive.

Consultant: Exactly! That shift in perspective can be incredibly helpful. Let’s practice that thought. Next time you find yourself in a public speaking scenario, how might you remind yourself of that?

User: I could repeat that to myself before I start speaking. I could say, “They are focused on their own stuff.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! To strengthen your confidence, we can also incorporate a situational simulation. Would you be open to role-playing how a public speaking scenario could play out?

User: Yes, I think that could help me practice. I’m a bit nervous about it, but I want to try.

Consultant: That's completely okay to feel nervous! Let's start with a very simple scenario—just introducing yourself. How would you like to start?

User: I would say, “Hi, I’m [Name]. I’m excited to share some thoughts with you today.” 

Consultant: That sounds great! Now, imagine standing in front of a small audience. Let’s try it out—go ahead and deliver your intro as if we’re in that situation.

User: (nervously) Hi, I’m [Name]. I’m excited to share some thoughts with you today.

Consultant: You did a wonderful job! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit strange, but not as scary as I thought it would be.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! The more you practice, the more comfortable it will become. What other situations can we practice to help you prepare?

User: Maybe I could practice answering questions or sharing a small presentation? That would help too.

Consultant: Absolutely, practicing those situations will build your confidence. Let’s draft a simple presentation on a topic you enjoy. What topic would you like to choose?

User: I really like talking about my favorite books. I could prepare something about that.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Let’s work on structuring that presentation. Together we can break it down into manageable parts, allowing you to focus on one point at a time.

User: Okay! I think I’d like to start with an introduction to my favorite author and why I like their work.

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! As you prepare, try to visualize yourself sharing this with your peers. How might that vision change your feelings about the experience?

User: I think if I visualize it as a fun conversation rather than a presentation, it could ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! Visualizing it positively can help frame your mindset. As we develop this further, are you finding moments where you feel your confidence is increasing?

User: Yes, actually. Just talking about my favorite author feels exciting rather than scary.

Consultant: That’s amazing progress! Let’s work on maintaining that excitement and helping you connect with your audience. It's all about building those positive experiences.

User: I can’t wait to practice more! I feel like I’m learning how to combine relaxation techniques with this preparation.

Consultant: You’re doing beautifully! It's all about integrating those skills. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ll focus on until our next session.

User: I’ll practice my introduction and visualize my presentation positively, while also reminding myself that others are focused on their own experiences.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! We’ll check in next time about how these strategies worked for you. Remember, you’re building skills that will serve you well in the long run.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more empowered. See you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing how your progress goes. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much more confident about my public speaking. I managed to apply the techniques we talked about during my final exams, and it really helped me stay calm!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in managing your anxiety during public speaking. Can you tell me more about what specific techniques you found most helpful?

User: I focused on my breathing exercises and positive self-talk. Whenever I felt anxious, I reminded myself of what we discussed, like visualizing a positive outcome.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It’s impressive that you were able to apply them successfully. How did you feel during your exams while using these techniques?

User: I felt surprisingly calm. It was as if I had control over my anxiety. There were moments when I started to feel nervous again, but I would use my breathing to center myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! It’s really about creating that sense of control. Now that you’ve experienced success, do you have any concerns about maintaining this progress in future situations?

User: I’m a bit worried that I might revert to feeling anxious again when I face new challenges, especially in group projects or presentations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those concerns. Change takes time, and it’s understandable to worry about setbacks. How do you think you can prepare yourself to handle anxiety in those future situations?

User: Maybe I could create a checklist of the techniques that worked for me, so I can remind myself to use them again when I feel anxious?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Having a checklist can serve as a helpful reminder. You can also incorporate practice sessions to apply your techniques in a low-pressure environment. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, I think practicing in smaller groups would help me feel more comfortable before presenting to larger audiences.

Consultant: Exactly! Gradual exposure can help you build confidence. Have you discussed this plan with any of your classmates or friends who might support you?

User: I haven’t yet, but I can definitely share it with my friends. They’re always supportive, and I think they would be willing to practice with me.

Consultant: That’s a great step! Surrounding yourself with support can enhance your confidence even more. As we talk about these challenges, how are you feeling emotionally right now about your preparation for the future?

User: I feel more hopeful. Knowing I have support and a plan in place makes the idea of future presentations less daunting.

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear! Let’s ensure this hopefulness translates into a solid plan of action. Can we outline some specific steps or situations where you want to apply your techniques?

User: Sure! I want to start with smaller group discussions and then progress to larger presentations in class.

Consultant: That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. As you navigate these situations, it might be useful to reflect on your feelings afterward. Could you keep a journal to note down what worked and what didn’t?

User: I like that idea! Keeping a journal could help me process my emotions and track my improvement over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can provide valuable insights into your progress and highlight areas for growth. How about setting specific times each week to review what you’ve written?

User: Yes, I can set aside time every Sunday to reflect on my week. That way, I can see my progress and adjust if needed.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! By reassessing your feelings and strategies weekly, you’ll be able to reinforce what works best for you. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today regarding your journey?

User: I think we’ve covered everything well. I feel like I have a solid plan moving forward.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It seems you’ve made great strides, and I believe that your commitment to practicing these techniques will continue to benefit you. Remember, if you encounter any challenges, it’s okay to reach out for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I feel more equipped to handle my anxiety now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Before we wrap up today, let’s quickly summarize your key takeaways. What are the main strategies you’ll be focusing on?

User: I’ll use breathing exercises, positive self-talk, and I’ll practice in small groups before moving to larger presentations. Also, I’ll keep a journal to track my progress.

Consultant: Excellent summary! As you take these steps, don’t forget to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. You deserve recognition for your hard work. I believe in your ability to continue managing your anxiety.

User: Thank you! That means a lot to me. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! This will be our last session for now, but remember, you have the tools and support you need. If you ever feel the need for guidance again, feel free to come back anytime.

User: I will! Thank you for everything! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care of yourself, and best of luck with your future presentations. You’ve got this!
