Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling? 

User: Hi. I don’t really know. Sometimes I feel angry for no reason, and I can't control it. At school, I even broke a classmate's stuff, and now my parents are really mad at me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some really strong feelings right now. It’s important to understand where that anger comes from. Can you tell me more about what was happening when you felt angry?

User: I don’t know... I just get really annoyed when people talk to me or when they don’t do what I want. Then I just lash out.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s tough when you feel annoyed and overwhelmed. Have you noticed any specific situations at school that often trigger your anger?

User: Yeah, sometimes when my friends don’t let me play the game I want or when they laugh at me for doing something wrong. It makes me really mad!

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel upset when you think someone is being unfair or disrespectful to you. How do you usually react when these things happen?

User: I just shout at them or do something to hurt them, like breaking their toys.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like your anger feels very powerful in those moments. What do you think happens after you react that way? How do you feel afterwards?

User: I usually feel bad after. My parents yell at me, and I feel even more alone. 

Consultant: It’s tough feeling that way. It seems like the reactions from your parents and friends make everything harder. Let’s try to explore other ways you could express those angry feelings instead of lashing out. Would you be open to that?

User: I guess so. But I don’t know how to change.

Consultant: We can definitely work on some strategies together! One way could be to take deep breaths when you start feeling angry. Do you think you could try that?

User: Maybe... but it’s hard when I’m really mad.

Consultant: That’s true. It can be challenging. Another thing we can do is look for what helps calm you down, like drawing or playing a game you enjoy. Have you ever tried that before?

User: Sometimes I like to draw, but I forget to do it when I’m angry.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Maybe we can set a reminder in your mind. Each time you feel angry, you could try to switch to drawing for a little bit. Would you like to give that a try this week?

User: Yeah, I can try drawing when I feel angry. But what if I still want to scream at them?

Consultant: That’s okay! It's normal to feel that way. Instead of screaming, perhaps you could count to five slowly or go to a quiet place to cool down before reacting. Would that work for you?

User: I can try counting. 

Consultant: Perfect! Counting can help make those big emotions feel a little smaller. Let’s also think about what else can help you stay calm. Is there someone you trust at school who could help you talk things through?

User: Maybe my teacher. She is nice sometimes, but I don’t want her to think I’m a bad kid.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re worried about how others see you, but your teacher can help you manage your feelings better. What if you tried talking to her about how you feel?

User: I don’t know... I’m still scared she’ll get mad at me.

Consultant: That fear is understandable. But remember, your teacher's goal is to help you. Maybe you can start with something simple, like saying you’re having a tough time with anger. Would that help ease your worry, do you think?

User: Maybe... I guess I could try saying that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, it’s all part of learning how to express your emotions better. We can keep practicing these strategies together. Do you feel like you have a bit more understanding of why you get angry now?

User: Yeah, I think I do. It’s just hard to change.

Consultant: Change can take time, and that’s perfectly okay. Just being aware of those feelings and trying new things is already a big step. How do you feel about practicing these ideas for next time we meet?

User: I feel a bit better about trying. I do want to change.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude to have! I believe you can do it. We’ll continue to work on strategies for managing your feelings. Remember, I'm here to support you. 

User: Okay, thank you. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been a bit confused. After the group activity, I had some disagreements with my classmates. I tried to apologize, but I still felt awkward afterwards. It’s like nobody really understands me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve had a tough time connecting with your classmates. Apologizing can be really hard, especially if you still feel uneasy about it. Can you share a little more about how that disagreement made you feel?

User: I felt really isolated and sad because I didn't want my classmates to be upset with me. But sometimes, it’s like I don’t know how to make things better.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling sad and also unsure about how to fix things. It’s great that you recognize those feelings, though. What do you think might help you feel more confident in resolving conflicts with your classmates?

User: I suppose if I could just say what I felt without them getting mad at me, that would help. But it’s scary to think about them not liking me because of what I say.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared about being judged, especially when you care about your friendships. Let’s think about that fear for a moment. When you imagine expressing your feelings, what specific thoughts come to your mind that make you hesitate?

User: I think they might say I’m being dumb or that I shouldn’t have feelings at all. I worry they won’t want to be my friend anymore.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be heavy to carry. It’s important to remember that it’s okay to have feelings and to express them. What if we looked at your worries more closely? Can you think of a time when expressing your feelings led to a positive outcome?

User: Well, there was that one time I told my teacher I was upset about a group project. She helped me, and my teammates listened. That made me feel better, but I still feel unsure with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! It shows that sometimes sharing your feelings can lead to a positive action. Could you imagine ways to express your feelings to your classmates, maybe by using what you learned from telling your teacher?

User: Maybe I could ask if they would listen to me first before I say anything. Like, I could start with, “Can I share something that's bothering me?”

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Asking for permission shows respect for their feelings, and it’s a nice way to start a discussion. How does that make you feel, thinking about trying this?

User: It makes me feel a bit less nervous. At least I wouldn’t be talking out of nowhere, and they might be more ready to listen.

Consultant: Exactly! They might really appreciate that you’re being considerate. Now, let’s think about how you can follow through with that plan. How would you feel after sharing your feelings with them, regardless of their response?

User: I think I would feel proud that I tried and maybe less alone, even if they don’t react the way I want.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Recognizing your courage to share can be a huge step forward. What can you do to remind yourself of this courage when you’re feeling uncertain?

User: Maybe I can write it down or think about how I felt after talking to my teacher. I just need to remember it’s okay to feel nervous.

Consultant: Writing it down is a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reminder of your strength. It’s absolutely okay to feel nervous; it shows that you care. Now, let’s role-play a scenario where you might express your feelings to a classmate. Would you like to try it?

User: Sure! I think that could help if I practice first.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you see a classmate in the playground after the disagreement. What would you say to start the conversation?

User: I might say, "Hey, can we talk? I felt bad about what happened the other day."

Consultant: That’s an excellent opener! It’s clear and invites dialogue. How do you think your classmate might respond?

User: They might say yes or ask what I mean. I hope they’re willing to listen.

Consultant: It’s possible they will want to listen—many kids appreciate when someone is honest. If they respond positively, how might you continue the conversation?

User: I could say how I felt left out and that I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I just want us to be okay again.

Consultant: That’s a heartfelt way to communicate! It shows vulnerability and a desire to mend the friendship. You’re doing wonderfully at exploring these feelings. How are you feeling about this strategy now?

User: I feel like I could actually try this! It’s good to know I can say how I feel without being scared all the time.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for feeling empowered to express your feelings! As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to remember from our session?

User: I think I want to remember that it’s okay to express my feelings and that practicing can help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering it’s okay to express yourself is a vital lesson. I'm here for you, and I'm excited to see you try out your new strategies. If you ever need support, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been wanting to express myself more, but sometimes I still feel a bit scared when talking to teachers. I just want to be understood.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to express yourself! Can you tell me more about the times you feel scared when talking to teachers? What’s going through your mind then?

User: Well, I think what if the teacher gets mad at me? Or what if I say something wrong and everyone laughs? 

Consultant: I can see why that would make you feel anxious. It sounds like you worry about what others think of you. Let's explore that thought further. What evidence do you have that the teacher would get mad or that your classmates would laugh?

User: I don’t really have any proof. It’s just a feeling I get. Maybe because of my mom. Sometimes she gets angry too.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel that way when you've experienced anger around you. Can we try to think of a time when a teacher was actually nice to you? What happened then?

User: There was a time when I asked a question, and the teacher answered it kindly. Everyone seemed focused on the lesson. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that not all interactions with your teachers lead to negative reactions. How did you feel during that moment when the teacher was kind to you?

User: I felt relieved and happy. It was nice to ask questions without being scared.

Consultant: Wonderful! It sounds like you have the ability to enjoy positive interactions too. What if we practiced some ways for you to ask questions in class? 

User: I think that could help! But I still worry about what others might say.

Consultant: That’s totally okay to feel that way! Let’s work on a strategy. When you feel worried, you can take a deep breath and remind yourself of the good experience you had. How does that sound?

User: That sounds nice! I could think about the kind teacher when I feel nervous.

Consultant: Exactly! You can picture that kindness and use it to remind yourself that you can have those experiences again. What other things might help you feel less worried when participating in class?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say before raising my hand? 

Consultant: Yes! Practicing is a fantastic idea. Role-playing could be a fun way to prepare. Would you like to try that with me now?

User: Yes, I’d like that! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine I’m your teacher, and you have a question about a story we read. Go ahead and ask me.

User: Um, excuse me, can I ask about why the character did that?

Consultant: That was a fantastic way to ask! I love how you said “excuse me” first. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt good! I was scared at first, but practicing helped.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will get. Let's keep doing this. Is there another situation in class where you would like to express yourself?

User: Sometimes I want to share my ideas during group work, but I worry I won’t be listened to.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. Can we practice how to share your ideas during group work? What might you say to start?

User: Maybe I could say, “I have an idea we could try…” 

Consultant: Yes, that’s an excellent way to start! It invites others to listen. Would you like to give that a try now?

User: Sure! “I have an idea we could try for our project…”

Consultant: Fantastic! You did really well with that. You’re becoming more confident in expressing yourself. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels exciting! I want to keep getting better.

Consultant: I believe you can keep improving too! It’s great to hear your enthusiasm. Is there anything that makes you hesitant about sharing in a group?

User: I guess I'm still worried about conflicts with others if they disagree.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Conflicts can be tough. What if we think of some ways to handle disagreements? How might you respond if someone disagrees with your idea?

User: Maybe I could ask them why they think differently?

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Asking questions can help clear up misunderstandings and promote good communication. Let’s practice that. If a classmate disagrees with your idea, give it a shot.

User: “Why do you think that? What’s your idea?”

Consultant: Excellent! This way, you’re showing that you care about their thoughts, and it opens the door for a friendly discussion. How do you feel about participating in group activities now?

User: I feel more prepared! I want to try it out and see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! Remember, it takes time, and growth comes with practice. Before we wrap up, what’s one thing you hope to achieve in your next group activity?

User: I hope to share my idea and not feel scared of what others think.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! You’re really making progress, and I believe in you. As we finish our session today, keep in mind that it’s okay to feel nervous, but you can also find excitement in sharing. 

User: Thank you! I feel better about it now.

Consultant: You’re doing great work, and I’m proud of you! I’m here for any support you need in the future. Keep practicing those skills. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been okay, I guess. I really enjoyed working on the class project with my classmates. It was fun to work together!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you enjoyed the collaboration. What was the best part of working with your classmates?

User: I liked coming up with ideas together and seeing everyone’s different strengths. But I still worry a bit about what would happen if someone got upset during a project.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit worried about conflicts when working in a team. Let's explore those feelings more. Can you tell me what thoughts come to your mind when you think about disagreements during teamwork?

User: I think it might be like when my mom gets really angry. I get scared when people shout or get upset. I don’t want to feel that way again.

Consultant: I can understand why that would be scary. It’s hard to focus on working together when you're worried about anger. How did you feel when you noticed everyone working well during your project?

User: I felt happy! Everyone was having fun, and I wanted to keep helping. But sometimes I still thought about what if someone got mad at me for the ideas I had.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt happy while working with your classmates! Let's try to shift those worried thoughts. What evidence do you have that someone would get mad about your ideas, especially if you all enjoyed the project together?

User: I guess I don’t really have proof. It just feels like something might go wrong. 

Consultant: That’s a valid thought, but recognizing that you may not have evidence for it is an important step. What would you tell a friend if they were worried about the same thing happening? 

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to share ideas, and that not everyone will get upset.

Consultant: That’s a really supportive thing to say! Let’s consider applying that same kindness to yourself. What could you tell yourself when similar fears come up in a group?

User: Maybe I could say it’s okay to share, and that my friends probably want to hear my ideas.

Consultant: Absolutely! By reminding yourself that your ideas are valued, you can begin to feel more comfortable participating in teamwork. Are there any recent situations where you felt comfortable sharing your thoughts?

User: Well, during the project, I did share some ideas and nobody got angry! They said they liked them!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You had a positive experience, and they appreciated your input. How did that make you feel?

User: It made me feel proud. I didn’t think they would like my ideas.

Consultant: That's a great feeling to have! Let’s focus on building that confidence. What could you do next time you're in a group or team situation?

User: I think I could remind myself to speak up more. 

Consultant: Yes! And remembering how well it went last time can help too. How about we come up with a little plan together for when you feel nervous about speaking up? 

User: Okay! Maybe I can take a deep breath and tell myself that I have good ideas too.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Taking a deep breath can help calm those nerves. Let’s also practice how you might introduce your ideas next time. Can you give it a try?

User: Sure! I could say, “I have an idea that I think might help with our project.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a perfect way to start. Practicing this can help make it feel more natural. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident! 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Let’s keep building on that confidence. Do you have any upcoming group activities where you can practice these skills?    

User: Yeah, we have a group project coming up soon. 

Consultant: Perfect! You can put your plan into action there. Remember to reflect on how it goes afterward—what worked well and what feelings came up. We can discuss it in our next session. 

User: Okay, I’ll try to remember that. 

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for taking these steps. You’re developing skills that will help you in many situations! Before we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind about teamwork or your feelings?

User: I want to keep being part of the group. I think it’s fun, and I want to keep enjoying it! 

Consultant: That’s such a positive mindset! I believe you’ll do great in your group activities. Let’s meet again soon to check on your progress. You’re doing amazing work!

User: Thanks! I’m really looking forward to it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s okay to feel worried sometimes, but you have the tools to manage those feelings. Take care until next time!

User: I will! See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. It's wonderful to hear about your recent progress. How are you feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better. I’ve been getting compliments from my parents and teachers about how well I’m doing in my activities. It makes me feel happy but also a bit nervous.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've received positive feedback! It's normal to feel a mix of happiness and nervousness when doing well. Can you tell me more about what specific activities made you feel this way?

User: I participated in a school play, and I had a speaking role. Everyone said I did a good job, and that made me feel proud. But I was also afraid of making mistakes.

Consultant: Participating in a school play and having a speaking role is quite an achievement! It sounds like you handled it well despite your fears. How did it feel to hear compliments from others?

User: It felt amazing! But at the same time, I worry that maybe I won’t do as well next time or that I’ll mess up.

Consultant: I can understand why you might feel that way, especially with the pressure to perform well. Let's explore those worries further. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you start to feel nervous about your next performance?

User: I think things like, "What if I forget my lines?" or "What if I mess up in front of everyone?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite stressful. It's common to have thoughts like these, but they can make us feel anxious. Can we take a moment to reflect on any evidence that supports or challenges these thoughts?

User: I guess I practiced a lot and did well during the rehearsals. So maybe I wouldn't really forget my lines. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Practicing well is a strong indication that you can succeed. How might you reframe those nervous thoughts into something more encouraging?

User: Maybe I could think, "I practiced a lot, so I can remember my lines" or "It's okay to make a mistake; I can improve next time." 

Consultant: Those are wonderful alternative thoughts! They switch the focus from fear to your abilities and the possibility of learning. How do you feel about using these positive thoughts the next time you feel anxious?

User: I think it would help! I want to feel more confident when I perform.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! We can also work on some self-affirmation techniques to reinforce those positive thoughts. Would you be open to practicing some together?

User: Sure, I’d like that!

Consultant: Let's create a simple affirmation. For instance, you could say to yourself, "I am prepared and capable." How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I like it.

Consultant: Fantastic! You can say it before your performances to boost your confidence. How else do you think you could reinforce this positive mindset?

User: I could write it down and maybe even say it in front of the mirror before going on stage!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! It allows you to express and believe in your positivity even more. As you continue to receive positive feedback, remember to acknowledge your hard work as well. 

User: I will! I think it will help me feel more proud of myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating your achievements is very important. Let's also discuss how you plan to keep up the positive behavior and apply what you've learned from this experience in the future.

User: I want to keep trying new activities and not be afraid of making mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Trying new activities can help build your confidence and show you that it's okay to step out of your comfort zone. How can you remind yourself to stay brave when trying something new?

User: Maybe I can remember that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they can help you grow. How do you feel about the progress you're making so far?

User: I feel really good! I think I’ve come a long way. 

Consultant: You truly have! Your ability to reflect on your thoughts and change them is impressive. Let's make sure to keep building on this progress. 

User: Yeah, I want to keep improving.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset. As we wrap up our session today, let's highlight one key takeaway. What's one thing you want to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember that I am capable and that I can handle new challenges!

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a powerful affirmation to carry with you. I believe you'll continue to succeed and grow in your confidence. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I look forward to our next session together.
###################
Consultant: Hello, I’m really glad to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing better. My teacher said nice things about me at the parents' meeting, and it made me feel happy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your teacher recognizing your progress has had a positive impact on you. How did that make you feel in terms of your self-control and your behavior?

User: It made me feel proud, like I can manage myself better now. I’m trying hard to be good and not upset anyone.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re focusing on being good and trying to avoid upsetting others. Can you share an example of how you’ve managed your feelings or actions when you felt like losing control?

User: Well, the other day I wanted to yell at someone who was bothering me, but I took a deep breath instead and walked away. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Taking a deep breath and walking away shows a lot of self-control. How did you feel after you did that?

User: I felt proud of myself. I didn’t want to explode like before. It felt nice to be calm.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It seems like you’re learning to handle your emotions in a positive way. Let’s talk about what you can do to keep this progress going. Do you have any ideas for a self-management plan or rewards for your good behavior?

User: I think if I do something good at school, maybe I could have some extra playtime at home. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Having extra playtime can be a nice reward for your efforts. How about we set some specific goals together? What kind of behaviors would you like to see as part of this plan?

User: I want to keep my hands to myself and help others more, like sharing my toys.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Keeping your hands to yourself and being helpful is a great way to show your self-control. How about we create a checklist that you can use at school and at home? 

User: Yes! That would help me remember to do those things. 

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! We can make it colorful and fun, so you enjoy using it. Besides your checklist, do you think having a special place to mark your achievements could help you?

User: Yeah! Maybe I can have a sticker chart where I get a star for each good thing I do.

Consultant: A sticker chart is a fantastic idea! It will visually remind you of your achievements. How do you think your parents can support you with this plan?

User: They could help me remember to check the chart and maybe give me stickers when I do well.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful. Open communication with your parents about your goals will strengthen your support system. Do you feel comfortable talking to them about these ideas?

User: Yes, I can show them the chart and tell them about the rewards.

Consultant: Perfect! This will help you feel more motivated. Now, let’s think about social strategies when interacting with other children. What have you enjoyed doing with friends recently?

User: I liked playing with them during recess and they liked it when I shared my toys.

Consultant: That’s great! Sharing toys is an excellent way to build friendships. How can you continue to be a positive part of your playtime with friends?

User: I can invite them to play new games and ask if they want to share too.

Consultant: That’s a lovely approach! Inviting friends and encouraging sharing will create a fun and supportive environment. I believe that with your positive mindset, you can make great choices. 

User: Thank you! I feel really happy about this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Your happiness is important. Before we finish, let’s recap what we’ve discussed today and the steps you’re taking moving forward. 

User: Okay! I will have my behavior checklist, a sticker chart, and I’ll keep trying to be nice with my friends.

Consultant: Yes, that’s correct! Remember, you have the tools to manage your feelings and support your positive behaviors. Keep using these strategies, and you will continue to see improvement!

User: I will! Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I believe in you and your ability to keep growing. If you ever need support or feel uncertain, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Goodbye for now! 

User: Goodbye!
