Consultant: Hello, Zhu! I'm glad to see you here today. I want to check in with you about how you've been feeling since we last talked. Can you share a bit about your current emotions or any thoughts that have come up for you recently?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about what happened with the story I made up about being robbed. It's been on my mind, and I feel really embarrassed now. I think I wanted people to care about me, but instead, it just backfired.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of embarrassment and maybe some regret for how things turned out. It’s completely normal to want attention and care, but it seems like this experience has led to some unexpected feelings. Can you tell me more about why you felt the need to create that story?

User: Well, I just wanted people to notice me. I feel invisible sometimes, especially at home. My parents are always busy with their things, and I thought if I made something dramatic happen, they would have to pay attention.

Consultant: You mentioned feeling invisible at home, and it sounds like that feeling drives you to find ways to get noticed. It must be tough not having that connection with your parents. How did you feel after telling that story and getting attention from it?

User: At first, I felt like everyone was looking at me, and it was exciting. But then, it quickly turned into anxiety when I realized how serious it got. Now all I feel is shame.

Consultant: That mixture of excitement and anxiety must have been overwhelming. It's understandable to want that thrill of attention, but when it spirals into something serious, it can be confusing. Let's explore this a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about what happened?

User: I can't stop thinking about how stupid I was to lie. I think people see me as a liar now, and I fear they won’t trust me again.

Consultant: It's clear that you're feeling a strong sense of judgment towards yourself right now. Let's unpack this a bit. Do you believe that others view you strictly as a liar, or is there a possibility they could understand your reasons for wanting attention?

User: I suppose they might understand, but I doubt it. I just feel so ashamed. 

Consultant: Shame can really cloud our thinking. It might help to challenge that idea. What would you tell a friend who felt the same way about their actions? 

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn’t define who they are. But I can't seem to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That's a really compassionate approach. It shows you have the capacity to be understanding towards others. What if you tried to extend that same kindness to yourself? Can you think of any positive qualities you possess that aren’t related to this incident?

User: I’m good at drawing, and I try to be nice to people when I can. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Zhu! They reflect your unique self beyond this situation. How could focusing on your strengths help you move forward from the shame you’re feeling?

User: I guess if I focus on my art and being kind, I won’t feel so caught up in this mess. But I still worry about what people think of me.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those worries. What if we looked at ways to express your feelings and connect with others through your art or kindness? How do you think that would change the way people see you?

User: That might help. I just need to find a way to show who I really am instead of telling stories.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Focusing on genuine connections can create more meaningful relationships. What steps do you think you could take to share your art with others or be kind in small ways?

User: Maybe I could draw something for my classmates or help them if they need it. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas, Zhu! Sharing your art or offering help can pave the way for better relationships. It's important to remember that building trust takes time, and showing your true self is a strong foundation. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds easier than coming up with big stories. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling hopeful! Starting with small actions can make a significant impact. As we wrap up today, what key insights from our conversation do you want to carry with you moving forward?

User: I want to remember that I can be myself and that it's okay to make mistakes. I need to focus on my strengths and let go of this shame.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Zhu. Embracing who you are is key to building authentic connections. If those feelings of shame or isolation come up again, remember that you're not alone, and it’s okay to seek support. I'm here for you whenever you need to talk.

User: Thank you. I appreciate that.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Zhu Jia! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you may be feeling a bit isolated and ashamed after the recent events at school. Let's talk about how you're feeling and what happened. Can you share a bit more about your experience?

User: Hi. I feel so embarrassed because the stories I made up were exposed. My classmates and teachers are looking at me differently now. I feel very alone and like nobody wants to be around me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhu Jia. Feeling embarrassed and isolated can be incredibly overwhelming. Let's explore this a bit. What are some of the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about being in that situation at school?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is judging me. I feel like I don't belong anymore. I wish I could just disappear sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really judged and that you don't fit in right now. Those feelings can make it even harder to connect with others. Have any specific moments stood out to you where you've felt especially isolated?

User: Yes, yesterday during lunch, I sat alone, and I could see my classmates whispering. It felt like they were talking about me. I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: I can imagine how painful that must have been. It seems like you're really in need of support and connection. When you think about your classmates whispering, what thoughts do you have that might be contributing to that feeling of isolation?

User: I keep thinking they must be talking about my stories and how fake I am. I feel like a fraud now and that they won't accept me anymore.

Consultant: That's a very heavy burden to carry, feeling like a fraud. It's important to recognize that these thoughts might not reflect the full reality of the situation. Sometimes our mind can exaggerate things. What evidence do you have that your classmates are judging you that way?

User: Well, I don't really have any solid proof. It's mostly just my anxiety talking, I guess. 

Consultant: It's great that you’re recognizing how much your anxiety plays a role in your thinking. Let's try to challenge those thoughts a bit. If a friend were in your shoes, feeling judged like this, what might you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that people can be more forgiving than we think, and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes we’re much harsher on ourselves than we would be on others. How can we use that perspective to help yourself in this situation? 

User: I guess I can try to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that I can learn from this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Zhu Jia! Learning and growing from our experiences is a healthy approach. Let’s build on this! Can you think of some small steps you could take to connect with your classmates, despite feeling ashamed?

User: Maybe I could start by sitting with someone I used to talk to. It might feel awkward, but it could help.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Taking that first step to reconnect with someone can be really empowering. What do you think might be some of the fears that could come up as you move forward with this?

User: I worry they’ll bring up the stories again or that they’ll still judge me.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might feel safer to avoid those uncomfortable moments, but facing them could also lead to growth. What would you say to yourself if those fears came true?

User: I would remind myself that I am not defined by a few mistakes, and I can show them who I really am.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the strength to redefine how others see you. As we work on this, let’s practice some social skills. How about we role-play a situation where you approach someone to talk during lunch?

User: That could be helpful! I need to practice how to break the ice without feeling awkward.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you walk up to someone. You might start with a simple greeting. How would you initiate that conversation?

User: I could say, “Hi! Mind if I join you?” or something like that.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a friendly and open way to reach out. Practicing this can make it feel more natural. Let’s continue to explore different scenarios together, so you feel more confident next time.

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I feel like I need to approach more people, but the fear is so strong.

Consultant: Understandable. Fear often comes into play when we’re stepping out of our comfort zone. Let's discuss how to cope with that fear. Are there particular calming techniques you use when you're anxious?

User: Sometimes I take deep breaths, but it doesn’t always help when I’m really stressed.

Consultant: Breathing is a good start! You might also try to visualize yourself in a positive social experience or even affirmations like “I am accepted just as I am.” Would you like to work on some affirmations that resonate with you?

User: Yes, I think that could help. It would be nice to think positive things about myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's create a couple of affirmations together. How about something like, “I am worthy of friendship,” or “I can be myself, and that’s enough.” 

User: I like those! I think saying these would make me feel better about myself.

Consultant: Wonderful! Repeating affirmations can become a strong tool for building your confidence. You can use them whenever you feel anxious. As you think about our session today, what are some key takeaways for you moving forward?

User: I learned that my feelings of shame and judgment are mostly in my head. I should focus on building real connections and that I can do it step by step.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Zhu Jia! Remember, building connections takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps. As we conclude our session today, I want to encourage you to keep practicing these skills, and I’m confident you’ll see progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about everything now, even though I still have some fears.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's completely normal to have fears as you embark on this journey. Just remember that each step you take is a step toward greater confidence. I'm here to support you whenever you need assistance.

Consultant: Hello, Zhu Jia! I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I tried speaking up in class, and the teacher acknowledged me. But sometimes, I still feel the urge to make up stories to escape my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your progress in class! It’s normal to have mixed feelings. Can you tell me more about when you find yourself wanting to create those stories? What usually happens?

User: It's usually during times when I'm alone or when there's too much silence. I struggle to find real things to talk about, so I just start making up stuff.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those moments can feel a bit overwhelming. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel that urge to create stories?

User: Yes, I think it’s because I fear being judged or feeling like I have nothing interesting to share. So, I try to make things more exciting in my mind.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s understandable to want to make things more engaging when you’re feeling unsure. However, let’s explore those thoughts together—are there any real experiences you could share that might feel meaningful to you in those moments?

User: Sometimes, I remember funny things that happened with my friends, but I often think no one would care to hear those stories compared to the ones I make up.

Consultant: Those memories with friends sound valuable! What if we reframed that thought? Instead of thinking people wouldn't care about your experiences, what if you considered that they might genuinely enjoy hearing about your moments, even if they seem simple?

User: I suppose that’s true. I never really thought about it that way. 

Consultant: Great! It’s a good start. Would you be willing to try sharing one of those real experiences in a more relaxed setting, like with a small group of friends or during another class?

User: I think I could try that. I might start with sharing the funny moments first—it feels safer.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach! Starting with something lighter can help build your confidence. How do you feel about planning to try this in the next week?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I hope I can do it!

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Embracing those feelings can help you grow. What strategies do you think might help you calm those nerves before sharing?

User: Maybe I can take deep breaths or remind myself it’s just a casual chat? 

Consultant: Deep breathing and positive reminders are excellent strategies. It may also help to visualize yourself sharing the story and the positive reactions from your peers. Would you like to practice any specific scenarios together now?

User: Yes, let’s practice! I usually talk slower when I'm nervous, so I want to get more comfortable with my pace.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s choose a story you might share, and I’ll act as your listener. You can focus on your breathing and pacing while sharing.

User: Alright, I’ll talk about the time my friends and I tried to bake a cake but messed it up horribly. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fun story! Take a deep breath, and whenever you’re ready, start sharing.

User: (takes a deep breath) So, one day we decided to bake a cake for a friend's birthday. We forgot to add sugar, and it turned out completely tasteless! 

Consultant: (nods) That’s a great start! Keep going; what happened next?

User: We ended up laughing so hard at how bad it tasted. Everyone tried to act polite, but we all knew it was a disaster!

Consultant: That sounds like such a memorable experience! You did a fantastic job sharing. How did it feel to express that story out loud?

User: It felt nice! I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I would be. 

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that! You’ve just taken a step towards building your confidence. Reflecting on this experience, what do you think will help you remember this feeling the next time you want to share?

User: I’ll remember that laughter and how lighthearted it felt. Maybe that will encourage me to share more.

Consultant: Yes! Keeping that joyful experience at the forefront of your mind can positively influence your future interactions. Let’s wrap up today by discussing what you feel you’ve learned from our session. 

User: I think I’ve learned that sharing real stories can be fun, and that I can feel more confident if I give myself permission to be myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing your authenticity and enjoying the process of sharing will help you grow. Keep practicing those positive self-reminders, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and ready to try sharing. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhu Jia! I’m excited for you to continue this journey. Remember, you’re doing great. If you ever need support, I’ll be here. 

User: Thanks again! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhu Jia! I'm really glad to see you today. Last time we talked, you mentioned feeling more confident in your communication skills and social interactions. How are you feeling about that now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good. After participating in the mental health activity at school, I realized I can express myself better. My classmates even invited me to join some extracurricular activities, which I found exciting!

Consultant: That's fantastic! It sounds like you're experiencing a positive shift in your self-confidence and social connections. Can you share how these invitations make you feel and what thoughts come to your mind when you think about participating in those activities?

User: I feel happy but also a little scared. I worry about not fitting in or being awkward since I tend to be shy. But I also think it could be a good chance to meet new people and learn new things.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel both excited and anxious about new opportunities, especially when they involve social interactions. Let’s explore that worry. What specific thoughts come up when you think about not fitting in or feeling awkward?

User: I keep thinking, "What if they don't like me?" or "What if I mess up on the first try?" It makes me hesitate to say yes to their offers.

Consultant: Those thoughts are certainly powerful. It seems like you're having some fears of rejection, which many people experience. Would you say these thoughts are helping you, or do you think they are holding you back from embracing these new opportunities?

User: I think they hold me back. I want to try new things, but those thoughts make me second-guess myself.

Consultant: It's great that you've recognized that pattern. We can work on challenging those thoughts together. For instance, what evidence do you have that supports the belief that they wouldn’t like you or that you might mess up?

User: I don’t have any strong evidence, actually. I guess I just assume based on my past experiences where I was more shy.

Consultant: It's understandable to connect past experiences to current feelings. However, it’s important to recognize that you’ve also had positive experiences recently, like participating in the school event. How might you view these new opportunities differently if you focused on those positive moments?

User: Maybe I could think that since I did well in the last event, I might do well again. I could also remind myself that everyone feels awkward sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Recognizing that it’s normal to feel awkward can help ease some pressure. Let’s think about practical steps. What is one small activity you might be willing to try that feels manageable but still pushes your comfort zone a little?

User: I think I could start by joining a club meeting with my classmates just to see how it goes.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a great plan! It allows you to ease into social situations with familiar faces. How about setting a goal for yourself, such as attending one meeting and then reflecting on how it felt afterward?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could handle that. I’ll try to focus on enjoying the experience instead of worrying too much.

Consultant: That’s an excellent attitude to adopt! Focusing on enjoyment rather than pressure can really shift your experience. As you prepare for this meeting, what thoughts or phrases could you use to encourage yourself?

User: I could tell myself, "It’s okay to be a bit nervous, and I’m here to have fun and learn." 

Consultant: Perfect! That's a positive affirmation to keep in mind. How do you think embracing this mindset will influence your experience at the meeting?

User: I think it will help me feel more relaxed and open to the experience. It might also allow me to connect better with others.

Consultant: Absolutely! Allowing yourself to be relaxed can foster connections with others. As we wrap up today, how would you feel about making a plan to process your feelings after the meeting, whatever they may be? 

User: I like that idea! I could write down my feelings afterward, whether I felt good or if it was challenging.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Reflecting on your experience will help you learn and grow, no matter the outcome. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. I’m really proud of you for taking these steps, Zhu Jia.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. It feels reassuring to know I have a plan.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I believe you're on an exciting path of growth and discovery. Keep in touch with those feelings of accomplishment, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more support. Good luck at your club meeting! 

User: Thanks! I will definitely keep you updated.

Consultant: Hello Zhu Jia! I'm glad to see you again for this session. Last time we talked about how you felt a sense of recognition from your peers after participating in the holiday activities, and you want to explore your future development. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really good after the event. The praise from my classmates and teachers gave me a boost of confidence. I’ve been thinking about what I want to do in the future and how I can keep getting that kind of recognition.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience really made a positive impact on you. What specific areas are you considering for your future interests and development?

User: I enjoy teamwork and activities where I can be creative, but I’m not sure if that can lead to a good career. I’ve always felt a bit lost when it comes to making long-term plans.

Consultant: It seems like you're interested in creativity and collaboration, but you’re feeling uncertain about how that translates into a career. Let's take a moment to think about some specific activities or subjects that truly excite you. What comes to mind?

User: I like working on group projects and creating things—like designing posters or even helping organize events. But sometimes I feel like my ideas aren’t good enough, and I hesitate to share them.

Consultant: Your passion for group projects and creativity is valuable! It's natural to have doubts about our ideas, but they are important, too. Can you share a time when you successfully contributed in a group setting and received positive feedback?

User: During the holiday activity, I helped plan an event, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The teachers praised my organization skills, and it felt great!

Consultant: That’s an excellent example! It highlights your ability to contribute positively in a team. How did receiving that praise affect your confidence in sharing ideas with others?

User: It made me feel more confident, but that feeling fades quickly. I still struggle to speak up in class or meetings.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when the environment feels intimidating. Let's focus on how you can build on that moment of recognition. What small steps could you take to gradually become more comfortable sharing your ideas in group settings?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing at least one idea whenever I have a chance, even if it’s a small one. That might be less overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can build your confidence over time. How would you feel about making it a goal to share one idea in your next class or group meeting?

User: I think I could do that! I feel a bit nervous just thinking about it, but I want to try.

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous about trying something new. Remember, even if it's a bit scary, it's an important step toward your development. After you share your idea, how would you like to reflect on the experience—what would you want to consider?

User: I’d like to check if I felt less anxious after sharing, and if I got positive reactions from others. It might help me see that my ideas really do matter.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Reflecting on your feelings and the feedback will provide valuable insights. As we continue, let's also explore ways to maintain your confidence beyond this first step. What other activities would you like to try that could help develop your skills?

User: I’d love to join a club or a group that focuses on creativity, like art or drama. It might give me a chance to express myself without too much pressure.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like an excellent idea! It can provide a relaxed environment to express your creativity and meet like-minded people. What steps can we plan now to help you find such a club?

User: I could ask my teachers or classmates for recommendations. Maybe I can look online, too. 

Consultant: That sounds proactive! Gathering information will guide you to the right opportunities. What timeline do you envision for starting this exploration of clubs?

User: I could start looking this week and aim to join something by the end of the month.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Setting a clear timeline can help keep you motivated. Let’s also consider how you’ll feel after taking these steps. What do you hope will change for you?

User: I hope I’ll feel more comfortable expressing myself, and maybe I’ll meet new friends who share my interests.

Consultant: Meeting new friends while building your comfort in self-expression can significantly contribute to your personal growth. Reflecting on what you’ve accomplished so far, how would you assess your self-esteem and feelings about independence after this session?

User: I feel like I have a clearer direction now. I’m more hopeful about trying new things and developing myself. It’s refreshing!

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling hopeful and clearer about your direction! As we wrap up, let’s summarize the goals you've set today: trying to share ideas more actively, exploring creativity clubs, and reflecting on your experiences. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes! That covers everything we discussed. Thanks so much!

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhu Jia! It’s been a pleasure to talk with you today. Remember, every small step counts toward your growth. Keep in touch, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhu Jia! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our discussion today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident after deciding to enroll in that short-term social skills training. I think it will help me develop my confidence and improve my interactions with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward! It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more confident. Can you share more about what specific changes you've noticed in yourself since making that decision?

User: I've felt a bit more hopeful, like I might actually improve in talking to people. However, I'm still nervous thinking about the training itself, like if I’ll fit in or be able to communicate well.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about such situations. You're stepping out of your comfort zone, and that's a brave move. What do you think might help reduce that anxiety as you prepare for the training?

User: Maybe if I practice a bit before the training or talk to someone who has taken it before, I would feel more comfortable. 

Consultant: Practicing beforehand sounds like a great strategy. Engaging with someone who has experience in that training could also give you helpful insights. How do you feel about reaching out to someone you know who might have taken it?

User: I'm a little hesitant to reach out. I usually shy away from talking about these things, especially if I feel like I already lack in social skills.

Consultant: I understand that it can be tough to reach out. Remember, seeking help is part of the learning process. How do you usually handle situations where you feel shy or unsure?

User: I tend to avoid those situations, which just makes me feel worse afterward. I know I should face it, but it's hard.

Consultant: Avoidance can provide temporary relief, but often it reinforces the feelings of anxiety. What if we brainstorm some small steps you could take to gradually face these situations instead?

User: I guess I could start by practicing with myself in front of the mirror or maybe even talking to a family member about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Practicing in front of a mirror can help boost your confidence, and discussing your feelings with a family member might help you feel supported. What do you think would be your next step after that?

User: If that goes well, maybe I could try talking to a friend or someone new at the training.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Starting small can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting a specific timeline for that practice in front of the mirror?

User: Maybe I can start tomorrow. Just 5-10 minutes of practice should be manageable.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Small time frames make it much easier to begin. As you practice, pay attention to how it feels. What are you hoping to gain from this?

User: I want to feel less awkward and more natural when talking, especially in social settings.

Consultant: Aiming for comfort and naturalness is a great goal. As you practice, try to remind yourself that everyone learns at their own pace. It’s okay to make mistakes along the way. 

User: That's true. I often forget that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! Each step is part of your learning experience. If you do make a mistake, how would you like to respond to it in a more compassionate way?

User: I think I could remind myself that I'm still learning and that it's okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That's a nurturing way to respond to yourself. Self-compassion can significantly ease the pressure. Have you had any experiences where you felt proud of handling a social situation well?

User: Actually, yes! There was a time I spoke up during a small group discussion at school, and I felt really good about it afterward.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! Reflecting on those moments can remind you of your capabilities. How can we use that as motivation going forward?

User: I could think back to that feeling of accomplishment when I'm facing new social situations.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping that good feeling in mind can help reinforce your confidence. Let's discuss any resources or support you might want to consider as you move forward with the training.

User: I think finding some online resources or videos about social skills might be helpful. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! There are many online resources available. I can suggest some if you'd like, or you can search for materials that resonate with you.

User: Yes, please! That would be helpful.

Consultant: I can recommend looking for videos on effective communication skills or social interaction strategies. Many channels provide practical tips and role-playing situations, which could be very beneficial. 

User: That sounds great! I will check those out.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what steps you plan to take moving forward.

User: I’ll practice speaking in front of the mirror, reach out to a family member, and look for online resources about social skills. 

Consultant: Those are all wonderful steps, Zhu Jia. I’m proud of your proactive approach! When we meet again, we can discuss how those plans worked out for you.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, be kind to yourself during this process. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
