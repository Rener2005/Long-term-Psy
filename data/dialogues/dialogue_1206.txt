Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here today. It seems like you've been dealing with quite a few emotions lately. Can you share a bit about how you’ve been feeling and what brought you here?

User: Hi. Well, I’ve been feeling really self-conscious and anxious. Most of my roommates are starting to date, and I can't help but feel lonely. People tease me for not being able to date; they say things like, "You can't even get a girlfriend." It just makes me feel more down.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really tough to feel isolated, especially when you're surrounded by your friends who are entering relationships. Can you tell me how these experiences are affecting your mood and your studies?

User: It's definitely affecting my mood. I feel really down on myself, and it's hard to focus on my studies. I keep thinking that if I can’t even talk to a girl, what’s wrong with me? It makes me anxious and I just don’t feel motivated anymore.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, feeling anxious and unmotivated must feel heavy. It seems like you're struggling with your self-image and how it connects to these social pressures. We're going to explore these thoughts together. What are some specific thoughts that come to your mind about yourself when you think about dating or being with someone?

User: I often think I’m just not good enough. Like, maybe I’m too shy or awkward. When I tried asking a girl out recently, she turned me down, and that just confirmed everything I was thinking.

Consultant: It's understandable that you would feel that way after experiencing rejection. These kinds of events can really amplify our inner critic. Let’s take a moment to unpack those thoughts—can you recall what thoughts crossed your mind when she rejected you? How did those thoughts affect your feelings at that moment?

User: I thought she probably saw me as a loser, and I felt so embarrassed. I think I just felt hopeless, like I’m never going to be in a relationship and that everyone else will move on without me.

Consultant: That’s a painful thought to carry. You felt hopeless and embarrassed, which are very heavy feelings. Let’s challenge that thought for a moment. Is it possible that there are other reasons why she might not have been interested that don’t reflect on your worth as a person?

User: I suppose she just might not have been interested in a relationship right now or was looking for someone different. But it’s hard to think that way when it feels so personal.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be hard to separate your self-worth from someone else's preferences. It’s important to recognize that rejection doesn’t define you. Let's consider how you would view this situation if it happened to a friend of yours. What would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s not a big deal and that there are plenty of people out there. It doesn’t mean they aren’t worthy. They just need to keep trying.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! If your friend deserves compassion and understanding, then so do you. How might incorporating this perspective into your own feelings about rejection change how you deal with it?

User: I guess it could help me not to take it so personally. I need to remember that rejection is just a part of the process and doesn’t mean I’m not good enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing rejection as a normal part of dating could be very empowering. Now, let's also think about how you could take small steps towards building your social confidence. Are there activities or social situations that you feel comfortable trying out where you can meet new people?

User: I like hanging out with some classmates during study sessions, but I’ve been staying away lately because I feel so down. Maybe I could start joining those study groups again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging in study groups could help you reconnect with others and also help you focus on your studies. What small step can you commit to taking this week to make it happen?

User: I think I'll join a study group next week. Just a little step to get back into the groove.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Remember, small steps can lead to significant changes over time. As we continue this journey together, how can you remind yourself of your worth, especially on harder days?

User: I could write down some positive affirmations or things I like about myself. Maybe remind myself that what I’m feeling is normal.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Keeping a list of your strengths can help you reinforce your self-worth. As we wrap up for today, what do you feel is the most significant insight or takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think it’s that rejection doesn’t define my value and that I have the chance to keep trying while also being kinder to myself.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Remember that it’s completely normal to face ups and downs on this journey, and being kind to yourself is key. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time, and remember that you can always build new connections at your own pace. 

User: Thank you! This was really helpful. I feel a bit lighter now and more hopeful.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care of yourself until our next session, and feel free to reflect on what we've talked about. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I’m really glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about your feelings of isolation and self-doubt regarding your social interactions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hello. Honestly, I still feel quite low about my social skills. I haven’t been interacting much with my roommates or classmates, and I feel even more alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still struggling with confidence in social situations and that the lack of interaction has made you feel more isolated. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you think about reaching out to others?

User: I often think that they won't like me or will judge me. It's like I expect them to reject me before I even try.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're worried about rejection. Do you think these thoughts might be a bit extreme or not entirely accurate?

User: Yeah, it feels that way, but I just can't shake them off. I often convince myself that I'm not worth their attention.

Consultant: Let's take a closer look at that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you aren't worth their attention? Are there any experiences that challenge this belief?

User: Well, I guess I have had some pleasant conversations in the past, but I just can't seem to remember those during stressful moments.

Consultant: It's interesting that you can recall some positive interactions but seem to focus more on the negatives. Maybe we can work on recognizing those positive experiences more. What if we try to remind ourselves of those moments when those negative thoughts arise?

User: That might help. I just need to figure out how to keep those memories in mind instead of dwelling on the bad ones.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! We could work on keeping a journal where you note down positive social interactions. This might help reinforce the belief that you are indeed likable. How does that sound to you?

User: That could be helpful, I think. Writing things down usually helps me reflect better.

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, in terms of taking action, what kinds of social activities do you think you might feel comfortable trying out on campus?

User: I’ve thought about joining a study group or some club, but I worry I won’t fit in or contribute anything valuable.

Consultant: It’s common to have those feelings, but remember that everyone is there to learn and grow together. How about we brainstorm some clubs or activities that align with your interests? This might give you a starting point.

User: I’ve always liked photography, and there’s a photography club that sounds interesting. Maybe I could join that?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Photography can be a fantastic way to connect with others who share similar interests. What about reaching out to the club or attending a meeting? What are your thoughts on taking that step?

User: I feel a bit anxious just thinking about it, but I also think it would be a good opportunity to meet new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious. What if you approached it as a chance to explore and enjoy photography rather than focusing too much on making friendships right away? Would that make it feel less overwhelming?

User: Yes, thinking of it that way makes it seem more manageable. I could focus on the photography itself rather than the social pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s all about taking small steps. If it feels too much, you can always try attending just one meeting. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. One meeting won't hurt, and it's not a huge commitment right away.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! After attending, we can discuss how it went during our next session. Remember to jot down any positive experiences you have, no matter how small, as these will reinforce your confidence.

User: I will definitely try that. I really hope this works out for me.

Consultant: I believe in you, Wang. You're taking important steps not just toward building new connections, but also in reshaping how you view yourself in social situations. How are you feeling about the plan we’ve outlined today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think focusing on one small step helps. I really want to see a change.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! As we wrap up our session today, let’s remember that progress can be gradual. Keeping that journal and exploring new activities will be important. What are you looking forward to the most about trying these new steps?

User: I’m looking forward to just getting out there and seeing what happens. I want to meet new people and feel less lonely.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Just take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences during our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more equipped to handle this now.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Wang! I’m glad to be part of this journey with you. Keep believing in yourself, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi! Well, I've had a bit of a mixed experience. I've made some new friends during club activities, which is nice, but I can't shake off the worry about whether I can maintain these relationships in the long run.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling both excited about your new friendships and anxious about how to keep those connections strong over time. Let's explore those feelings further. What specifically concerns you about maintaining these relationships?

User: I'm worried that I might not be able to express myself well or that I won’t meet their expectations. I don't really know how to set boundaries either. 

Consultant: Those are valid concerns. It’s great that you're recognizing them. Setting boundaries and expressing yourself can be challenging, especially in new friendships. Could you share an instance when you felt unsure about expressing yourself with these new friends?

User: Just last week, we were discussing our interests, and I felt pressured to agree with everything they said. I didn't want to seem different or out of place, so I just nodded along.

Consultant: It seems like you felt the need to conform to fit in, which is common in new social situations. Recognizing that pressure is an important first step. How did it make you feel, nodding along even though you might not have fully agreed?

User: Honestly, it felt frustrating because I wasn't being true to myself. I want to be genuine, but I fear it might make them like me less.

Consultant: That frustration is understandable, Wang. It’s common to worry that being authentic could jeopardize new friendships. However, true connections often stem from mutual authenticity. What do you think about expressing your own opinions in a friendly way? 

User: I think it would be great, but I still feel nervous. What if they don't react well?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous. One approach could be to start small. Maybe you could share a mild opinion or interest that is slightly different from theirs and gauge their reaction. It might help to prepare yourself by thinking of examples that feel comfortable to share. 

User: That sounds doable! I feel a bit more at ease thinking about it like that. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about gradual exposure and building your confidence. Have you thought about ways to communicate boundaries with your new friends? 

User: Not really… I haven’t even considered it, to be honest. I just thought I should go along with whatever they want.

Consultant: It's easy to fall into that pattern, especially when you're eager to ensure people like you. However, expressing your boundaries can help you build respect in these relationships. How do you think your friends might respond if you casually mentioned what you’re comfortable with?

User: I suppose they might actually appreciate my honesty. I just need to work on being open.

Consultant: Absolutely! Open communication can strengthen those relationships. Let’s think of some practical strategies. For instance, try stating your preferences when planning an activity. You could say, “I’d love to do this, but I’m more comfortable with that.” What do you think? 

User: That sounds pretty straightforward! I could definitely try that next time.

Consultant: That's the spirit! It’s great to see you feeling more empowered. Moving forward, how do you feel about your evolving identity in these new relationships? 

User: I feel hopeful! But it's just... I don’t want to mess things up by overthinking it all.

Consultant: Hopefulness is a great mindset! It’s normal to overthink when forming new bonds. Let’s remind ourselves that it’s a learning process. What if you treat each interaction as a chance to learn rather than a test?

User: That could help! Shifting my mindset like that sounds relieving.

Consultant: Definitely! By viewing interactions as learning experiences, you can take the pressure off yourself. Also, how comfortable do you feel talking to the opposite gender in these settings? 

User: Honestly, a bit unsure. I get awkward, especially when I try to start a conversation.

Consultant: Many feel that way. Focusing on shared interests can help ease the awkwardness. What are some topics you think are safe and interesting to bring up with them?

User: Music and movies—those are usually good conversation starters.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s great that you’ve identified those interests. Next time, you might try initiating a conversation by asking about their favorite bands or recent films they've watched. 

User: I can definitely do that! It feels less daunting when I know what to talk about.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building on shared interests can create comfortable dialogues. Let’s summarize what strategies you’ll use moving forward, so you can feel more prepared for your next social interactions. 

User: Okay. I’ll work on sharing my opinions, set clearer boundaries, and start conversations about music and movies.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! I’m excited for you to put it into practice. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more equipped and less anxious about navigating these new friendships. Thank you for all the help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang! Your willingness to reflect and change is commendable. As we wrap up, what do you think you'll focus on in our next session?

User: I'll share updates on my interactions and how I implement these strategies. I’m hopeful for our next talk!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, building relationships is a journey. Take care until we meet again! 

User: Thanks! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again. I remember last time we talked about your new friendship with a female classmate and how you're feeling a bit uncertain about expressing yourself and navigating the boundaries. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about our last conversation. I still feel excited about this friendship, but I also find myself overthinking our interactions. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself clearly or if I'm being too forward.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of excitement and anxiety regarding this friendship. Let’s explore your interactions a bit more. Can you share a specific moment where you felt unsure about how to express yourself?

User: Well, there was this one time when we were chatting, and I wanted to suggest hanging out. But I hesitated because I didn't want to come off as too eager or make her uncomfortable. I ended up not saying anything.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel cautious about suggesting plans, especially when you want to respect her boundaries. How did that decision make you feel afterward?

User: I felt a bit disappointed and frustrated with myself. I wanted to take that step but then I held back. It just made me question whether she actually enjoys spending time with me.

Consultant: It can be tough to navigate those feelings. You hoped to take a step forward, but instead, you felt like you missed an opportunity. Let’s dig a little deeper—what specific thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought things like, "What if she doesn't want to spend time with me?" or "I might be reading her signals wrong." It’s like I have a lot of doubts about how she perceives me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging, especially since they can create uncertainty in your mind. Let’s explore those doubts. How likely do you think it is that your friend doesn’t want to spend time with you? What evidence do you have to support that thought?

User: I don’t really have any concrete evidence. We’ve had some good conversations, and she seems friendly. It’s just my own fears getting in the way.

Consultant: It's insightful that you realized your fears are influencing your perception. If you were to view this situation from a more balanced perspective, what other possibilities could exist regarding her feelings towards spending time with you?

User: I guess it's possible she also enjoys our chats and might be open to hanging out. Maybe I’m just overthinking it.

Consultant: Exactly! Overthinking can lead us to focus on the worst-case scenarios rather than the facts. What might a small step forward look like for you in this friendship? How can you approach this in a way that feels comfortable?

User: Maybe I could casually ask her if she’d like to grab coffee or study together? That way, it doesn't feel like too much pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! It’s a non-threatening way to connect, and it gives her the space to respond as she feels comfortable. How does that make you feel in terms of your confidence to ask her?

User: I feel a little more confident just thinking about it. I like the idea of keeping it casual.

Consultant: That's wonderful! It's a healthy approach that respects both your feelings and hers. As you prepare to do this, what mindset do you think would help you stay positive and open during the conversation?

User: I think reminding myself that it’s okay to be myself and that friendships are about enjoying each other's company would help. I should focus on the fun of getting to know her better.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on the enjoyment of the friendship rather than the pressure of expectations can make a big difference. If she responds positively, how would that make you feel about your ability to express yourself in this friendship?

User: It would definitely boost my confidence! I would feel like I’m on the right track and that I can be more open with her in the future.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! And if she were to respond differently than you hope, how could you remind yourself to stay grounded and not let it impact your self-worth?

User: I think I could tell myself that it doesn’t reflect my value as a person. It just means we may not be on the same wavelength right now.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of your value regardless of external responses is powerful. As we move forward, what strategies can you implement to ensure you maintain that positive mindset and confidence—especially if self-doubt starts creeping in again?

User: I think keeping a journal about my interactions could help. I could write down my feelings, what went well, and any positive feedback she gives me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Journaling can help you track your progress and reflect on your growth. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made during our conversation today?

User: I feel much better now. I have a clearer idea of how to approach this friendship and my confidence has improved a bit.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It seems like you’re making significant strides in understanding your feelings and how to express them. Just remember—growing in friendships takes time, so be patient with yourself as you continue to navigate this. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and guidance throughout this. It’s comforting to have this space to talk through my thoughts.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang! I'm here to support you, and I'm proud of the work you've done today. Remember to celebrate each step you take. If you ever feel unsure again or want to talk about anything, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: I will! Thanks again for everything. I’ll keep you updated on how it goes with her.

Consultant: Sounds great! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself. Have a wonderful day ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to today's session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I did well in a recent campus event and received some recognition, which boosts my confidence. But sometimes, I still doubt if I can keep this up.

Consultant: It sounds like you've had a positive experience recently, and that recognition must feel good. Yet, those doubts can be tough to manage. Can you share more about what specific thoughts come up when you doubt yourself?

User: Well, sometimes I think about past failures, and I wonder if this success was just luck. I fear I might not always perform well like that.

Consultant: I see. It’s natural to have those fears, especially after facing setbacks. When those thoughts about luck and past failures arise, how do they make you feel in the moment?

User: They make me anxious. I start feeling like I’m not good enough and that I might let others down if I don't keep up the performance.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you put pressure on yourself to maintain a certain level of success. Let's explore this a bit more—can you identify any specific beliefs you hold about your own abilities in these moments of doubt?

User: I guess I often think that if I fail at something again, it proves I'm not capable. It’s like I tie my self-worth to my performance.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It sounds like you're linking your value to your successes. What if we challenged that thought? Is it possible that your worth as a person isn't solely reliant on your achievements?

User: I suppose so, but it's hard to separate the two. I always feel like I have to prove myself.

Consultant: Definitely, that's a common struggle. Let’s think about this: if a friend had the same thoughts you do, what would you tell them? Would you think they are undervaluing themselves?

User: I would probably say they shouldn't be so hard on themselves and that it's okay to not succeed all the time. I would encourage them to focus on their efforts instead.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. You deserve that same compassion and understanding. It’s okay to strive for success, but it’s equally important to recognize and celebrate your efforts, regardless of the outcome. Can you recall a recent situation where you put in a lot of effort, even if the result wasn't perfect?

User: Yes, when I organized a small study group, it didn’t go perfectly, but I felt like I contributed well. Some of my classmates appreciated my effort.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You demonstrated your capability to lead and foster collaboration, and others recognized and appreciated your contribution. How did that acknowledgement make you feel?

User: It felt good, actually. I felt valid in my role and that my efforts mattered.

Consultant: Exactly! You not only have skills but also the ability to impact those around you positively. Let’s focus on how you can remind yourself of these moments when self-doubt creeps in. What strategies do you think could help you strengthen this positive self-view?

User: Perhaps I could keep a journal of my achievements and positive feedback from others. That way, I could look back at it when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can help reinforce your self-worth by serving as a tangible reminder of your successes and contributions. How often do you think you would like to reflect on this journal?

User: I think doing it once a week would be good. That way, I can keep track of my progress consistently.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Weekly reflections could create a positive routine for you. Alongside this, let’s also talk about accepting failures. What does acceptance of failure look like for you?

User: I guess it means understanding that failure is a part of growth. If I can learn from it rather than seeing it as a reflection of my worth, it would be easier.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective. Embracing failure as a learning opportunity rather than a setback can empower you. How might you approach a potential failure in the future with this mindset?

User: I think I would remind myself that it doesn’t define me. I could also ask for feedback and figure out how to improve rather than just dwell on the disappointment.

Consultant: Excellent! Seeking feedback and focusing on improvement is a proactive approach. It can transform setbacks into stepping stones. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I’ve learned that I need to be kinder to myself and that my worth isn’t based only on my achievements. The idea of keeping a journal feels like a helpful step forward.

Consultant: I'm glad you found our conversation beneficial! Remember, you've made significant progress, and it’s important to acknowledge that. As we conclude, how do you plan to maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I think I’ll start with the journal and make a conscious effort to celebrate my efforts, even the small ones.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment! I believe you have the tools to continue feeling this way. You’re making strides, and I'm proud of you for that. If you ever need support or just want to reflect, feel free to come back anytime! 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident now and look forward to applying what we discussed.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m here for you. Take care, Wang, and remember to give yourself grace as you continue on your journey!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I finished that team project, and it went really well. I felt proud of myself for my contributions.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've gained a lot of confidence in your teamwork and management skills. What specific aspects of that experience stood out to you?

User: I think I really enjoyed collaborating with my teammates. We communicated well, and I felt like my ideas were valued. It made me feel more connected to them.

Consultant: It's great that you've fostered such positive interactions with your teammates. Building strong relationships can help reduce any ongoing tension. How do you feel about your friendships with your classmates now?

User: I still feel a bit of tension sometimes, but I think it's improving. Working well on that project helped me realize that I can contribute positively to the group.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization. It's often through collaboration that we can strengthen our social ties. As you reflect on this experience, what do you think you could do to maintain this positive momentum in your relationships with classmates?

User: Maybe I could invite them for more group studies or activities. Encouraging more team bonding could definitely help.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Engaging in more social and study-related activities can build your connections further. What specific steps do you think you could take to start inviting your classmates?

User: I could create a group chat and suggest regular study sessions or maybe even casual hangouts. I think that might encourage them to join in.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan. Keeping communication open in that way can help ease any tension you might feel. Have you thought about how to encourage your classmates to join these sessions?

User: I might start by telling them about how much I enjoyed our last project and how working together made studying easier. That might motivate them.

Consultant: Sharing your positive experience can indeed help get others on board. It often inspires them when they see the benefits of collaboration firsthand. As you plan this, how can you ensure you stay motivated to keep these connections alive?

User: I guess I could set reminders for myself to follow up with them regularly. Maybe even plan a fun event as a goal to look forward to.

Consultant: Setting reminders is a great idea! Having tangible goals, like planning a fun event, can keep your motivation strong. What kind of events do you think your classmates would enjoy?

User: A game night or a movie gathering could be fun. Something casual where we can relax and talk.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Creating a relaxed atmosphere can definitely help to strengthen those bonds. How do you think you'd feel after organizing an event like this?

User: I think it would feel satisfying to bring everyone together and just enjoy some time off from studies. It could help relieve some pressure too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a break and enjoying each other’s company is essential for emotional well-being. How do you plan to balance your study time and social activities to ensure you don’t feel overwhelmed?

User: I could schedule my study sessions around the social events, making sure I don't neglect my work while still enjoying time with friends.

Consultant: That's a very balanced approach. It's crucial to prioritize both academics and social life. Before we wrap up today, what do you think is the biggest takeaway or lesson from our discussion that you’d like to keep in mind moving forward?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is the importance of communication and maintaining my relationships. I want to make a conscious effort to reach out more and stay connected. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Maintaining those connections can enrich your life significantly. As we conclude today’s session, what specific actions will you commit to so that you can continue this positive trend?

User: I’ll set up the group chat this weekend and plan for a study session next week. Hopefully, I can arrange a casual hangout soon after.

Consultant: Those are excellent commitments, Wang! I believe this proactive stance will really help solidify the improvements you’ve made. Remember, anytime you need support or want to share your progress, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. It feels good to have a plan moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of your progress, and it sounds like you're on a great path. I look forward to hearing all about your events and how your relationships continue to grow in our next session. Take care!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time!
