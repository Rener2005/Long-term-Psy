Consultant: Hello, P! It's nice to have you back for this session. I know you've been feeling a heightened level of anxiety lately. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Yes, I’ve been really anxious about the new semester, especially with the pressure of my master's coursework. I find it difficult to think about going out or interacting with others, and I've been relying on takeout for food instead of going out.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, P. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed given the circumstances. You mentioned you're struggling with the thought of interacting with others. Can you describe what thoughts come to your mind when you think about socializing?

User: I just get this wave of fear. I start thinking about how people will judge me, or that I won't know what to say. It feels like everyone is more confident than I am.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are making social situations feel daunting for you. When you picture those moments of social interaction, how does that impact your feelings in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and helpless. I often feel like I want to disappear or avoid those situations completely.

Consultant: I can see how that would lead to wanting to avoid social interactions. It’s a protective mechanism, but it also keeps you from facing that fear. Can we try to identify a specific social situation that you might experience soon? Maybe we can break it down together.

User: There's a welcome event for new students coming up. I know I should go to meet people, but just thinking about it makes my stomach churn.

Consultant: The welcome event sounds like a perfect place for us to focus on. What is it specifically about this event that feels most intimidating for you?

User: I think it’s worrying about what to say and how to make a good impression. I keep imagining myself standing there alone, looking awkward.

Consultant: Those concerns are common, and it's important to remember that many people share similar fears. Let’s explore that anxiety further. What evidence do you have that things will go poorly, and might there be alternative outcomes?

User: I don’t really have real evidence, but I just feel like I won't connect with anyone. My past experiences haven’t been great, and it feels like everything will go wrong.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way based on your past. However, let’s challenge that thought for a moment. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their chances of making a connection at the event?

User: I guess I would say that they might meet some nice people and that it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: Exactly. While it’s normal to worry about making a connection, there’s also the possibility of positive experiences. How about we consider small approaches you could take at this event to ease your anxiety?

User: Like what? I only see myself standing awkwardly.

Consultant: How about setting a small goal for yourself, like initiating a conversation with just one person? It could be as simple as asking someone about their major or complimenting something they’re wearing. This way, you’re taking a small step forward.

User: That sounds less intimidating. I think I could at least try to say something to one person.

Consultant: That’s a great start, P! Remember, even if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly, consider it a learning experience. What do you think about creating a plan to approach that first conversation?

User: I’ll try thinking of a few simple questions I can ask. It could help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Preparing questions is an excellent strategy! Also, remind yourself that most people appreciate when others reach out to them. How are you feeling about your ability to try this by the event?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but I’m also still scared. What if I freeze up or say something awkward?

Consultant: It's okay to feel scared—acknowledging that is part of the process. Remember that everyone makes mistakes in conversation. What if you gave yourself permission to make mistakes, knowing it doesn’t define your worth?

User: That makes sense. If I mess up, it doesn’t mean I’m a failure. I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Good! Let’s also work on how you can positively reinforce yourself regardless of the outcome at the event. Afterward, perhaps you could reflect on what went well, even if it’s just trying to start a conversation.

User: That could help me focus on the positives instead of the negatives.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your efforts instead of the end result can help build your confidence. As we prepare for our next session, how about we set some goals for yourself leading up to the event?

User: I want to commit to talking to at least one new person and reflecting on my experience afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, P! I believe you can do it. We’ll go over how it went in our next session, and we can talk about what you learned, both good and bad.

User: Thank you! I feel a little lighter talking about this and making a plan. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, P! Remember, progress takes time, and every step you take is important. I'll be here to support you on this journey. Looking forward to hearing about your experience at the event next time!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. See you next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, P! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. Well, I tried to attend a classmate's gathering recently, but it didn’t go well for me. I felt really awkward and couldn't express myself, which made me retreat back to my dorm. 

Consultant: That sounds tough, and I appreciate you sharing that experience with me. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when things don’t go as planned. What were some of the thoughts you had during that gathering?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself, like everyone would judge me for not being able to contribute to the conversations. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite overwhelming for you. How did thinking that way make you feel at the gathering?

User: I felt anxious and wanted to leave as soon as possible. I was worried about what they might think of me. 

Consultant: That anxiety must have made it really difficult to enjoy the gathering. Sometimes our thoughts can lead us to feel more anxious. Have you noticed any patterns in the way you think about social situations?

User: Yes, I often jump to the worst-case scenarios. I assume people will think negatively of me without really knowing their thoughts.

Consultant: It’s quite common to have those automatic negative thoughts. Can we explore this a bit further? When you think that way, what evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? 

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. It’s just a fear I have because I’ve felt awkward before. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization, P. It seems like you might be dealing with some cognitive distortions, where your fears are influencing your perceptions. What other explanations could there be for how others perceive you?

User: Maybe they are more focused on enjoying the gathering than judging me. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much healthier perspective. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them? 

User: I’d probably tell them to relax and not worry about what others think. 

Consultant: That’s great advice! Let’s work on how you can apply that kind of thinking to your own situation. What might happen if you tried to replace those negative thoughts with more balanced ones during your next social gathering?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes, and it’s okay to not be perfect. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! It sounds much more compassionate toward yourself. How do you feel about practicing that mindset in real-life situations?

User: I think I’d like to try, but I’m still feeling hesitant. 

Consultant: That’s completely natural, P. It might help to set small goals for yourself at the next gathering. For instance, can you aim to speak to at least one person, even if it’s just a simple greeting?

User: That sounds manageable. I could do that. 

Consultant: Perfect! And if it goes well, how will you reward yourself afterward?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to something I like, like a good meal or some gaming time. 

Consultant: That sounds like a nice reward! Let’s also practice a few conversation starters together, shall we? This could help you feel more prepared.

User: Sure, that’d help! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s say you approach someone. You could start with, “Hi, how are you? What’s your major?” How does that feel to you? 

User: It feels a little easier said than done, but I think I could try it. 

Consultant: It might feel challenging at first, but practice will make it easier over time. Remember, it’s okay to be nervous—most people are during these interactions. 

User: That makes me feel a bit better. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! As we move forward, remember that every small step counts. What else would you like to explore today? 

User: I think I’d like to understand more about how to deal with my feelings of self-doubt after a social gathering. 

Consultant: Absolutely, self-doubt can often follow social interactions. After a gathering, what thoughts typically come to mind? 

User: I often replay everything I said or did and focus on any mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s very common too. Let’s try a technique where we challenge those thoughts instead. If you catch yourself replaying an event, how can you ask yourself if that thought is really true? 

User: I guess I could ask if I really did make a mistake or if it was just my perception of it. 

Consultant: Exactly! And remember that most people are focused on themselves rather than judging you. After these gatherings, you could take a moment to jot down what went well, too. 

User: That’s a good idea. I often forget the positive moments. 

Consultant: It’s easy to overlook them, but keeping a record can help shift your focus. You’re doing really well, P. Shall we summarize what we’ve worked on today? 

User: Sure! I want to practice being kinder to myself, challenge my negative thoughts, and engage in small social interactions. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I have confidence that you’ll make progress. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you can revisit these strategies. How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel more hopeful after discussing things with you. Thank you! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep practicing those skills, and we’ll continue to build on them in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, P! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we dive into our session, I’d love to hear how you've been feeling since our last conversation. What has been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about that group discussion. I felt like I didn't contribute enough, and I just felt really anxious about how they perceived me. I often doubt my ability to engage with others.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite stressful for you. Feeling anxious about how others perceive us can be tough. Can you share more about what specific thoughts were running through your mind during the discussion?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas weren’t good enough, and that everyone else was judging me for not speaking up. It made me feel invisible in the group.

Consultant: That feeling of invisibility can be really uncomfortable. It seems like you were caught in a loop of negative thoughts about your contributions. How do you think these thoughts impacted your feelings during the discussion?

User: I felt really anxious and, in the end, I didn't want to speak at all. I just wanted to leave the room.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid, P. When we think we aren’t contributing well, it can create a strong urge to withdraw. Do you notice any patterns in your thoughts that contribute to these feelings, perhaps something you automatically assume about yourself in social situations?

User: Yes, I always assume that I’ll be the worst in group settings. And I think everyone will notice if I don’t do well.

Consultant: You mentioned that you believe you might be the worst in these situations. Can we explore how realistic this belief is? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that thought?

User: I guess I don't have clear evidence that I am the worst. It’s just a feeling I’ve carried since I've struggled with social interactions.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, P. It’s common to carry those feelings, especially after previous experiences. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their contributions and abilities?

User: I would probably tell them they are doing their best and that it’s okay not to speak all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re clearly able to show compassion towards others. Now let's try to apply that to yourself. What if we replaced that negative thought with a more supportive one? How might you phrase it differently about your contributions in a group?

User: Maybe I could say that my contributions are valuable, even if I don’t speak a lot. 

Consultant: That sounds like a much kinder approach, P! Recognizing your value is vital. How do you think using this new perspective might change your feelings or actions in future discussions?

User: I think it could help me feel less pressure, and maybe I would be more willing to participate instead of holding back.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Let's build on this. What small steps could you take in your next group discussion to practice this new belief about yourself?

User: I could aim to contribute at least one idea and remind myself that it's okay to take my time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking it step by step can definitely make things feel more manageable. How does that idea make you feel about your next group meeting?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I really want to try it out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s wonderful you’re feeling hopeful. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Is there anything specific you want to be aware of or practice during your upcoming group meeting?

User: I want to remind myself not to overthink my contributions and just focus on sharing when I feel comfortable.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Focusing on comfort rather than overthinking can reduce pressure. How about we practice that mindset? What affirmations or reminders could you use to encourage yourself during the meeting?

User: Maybe I can repeat to myself, “My voice matters, and it's okay to be myself.”

Consultant: Perfect affirmation, P! That’s a powerful reminder. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you plan to do going forward and how you’ll use those new insights and affirmations. What stands out to you the most from our discussion today?

User: It stands out that I need to be kinder to myself and practice contributing in my own way. Using affirmations can really help me.

Consultant: I think you’ve made significant progress today. Remember, building confidence and practicing your communication skills will take time, but you’re on the right path. If you ever feel stuck, remember those affirmations. How do you feel about today’s session?

User: I feel encouraged and a bit lighter. Thank you for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, P! You’ve taken some important steps today. Keep being patient with yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little P! I'm glad you're here today. I’d love to hear about how you've been feeling lately, especially after your recent experience with the group activity.

User: Hi! I felt a bit relieved after participating in the group's activity. The others were very welcoming, but I still doubt if I really fit in. I wish I could feel more confident in these situations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you experienced some acceptance from the group! Doubting yourself is quite common, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you share more about what specific aspects of your performance you feel unsure about?

User: I guess I just worry that I didn’t contribute enough during the activities. I often hesitate to speak up in groups because I think others might think my ideas are silly.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Little P. It sounds like you're being hard on yourself for not contributing more. Let’s explore this—what might happen if you decided to voice your ideas, even if they feel silly?

User: I suppose it could be okay. Maybe someone else would find them helpful. But then I also fear being judged by others, which makes it really hard to speak up.

Consultant: It's understandable to fear judgment. Many people share this worry. Can we examine if there’s evidence supporting that fear? Have you experienced negative reactions in similar situations before?

User: Not really. In fact, the few times I did share something, people were surprisingly supportive. It's just that my mind goes blank in the moment.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It seems your past experiences indicate that people are supportive. Next time, would it help to remind yourself of these positive interactions when you’re in a group setting?

User: Maybe! I could write down those positive experiences on a card to look at beforehand. But I still feel nervous thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Preparing those reminders could serve as comfort. Let’s think about the feeling of nervousness. When you feel that way, what do you notice happening in your body and mind?

User: I often feel tightness in my chest, and I overthink every little detail of what I might say. It’s like there's a wall stopping me from connecting with others.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. Recognizing physical sensations like tightness in your chest is key. It sounds like these feelings can be a barrier to engaging. What if we practiced some calming techniques to help ease that tightness before participating in a group?

User: I would be open to that! Maybe deep breathing or something to help me feel more grounded?

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing is an effective technique. Let’s try this right now. Imagine breathing in slowly for a count of four, holding for four, and releasing for four. Let me know how you feel afterward.

User: Alright, let me give it a try… okay, that does help! I feel a bit lighter and more focused.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this before social interactions can be very beneficial. As you continue engaging in group activities, would you be willing to set small participation goals for yourself?

User: Yes, I think I can handle small goals. Maybe I could aim to share one thought in each meeting?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting goal! By aiming for one contribution, you’re allowing yourself the space to grow gradually. How do you think you could set reminders for this goal?

User: I could set a note on my phone for each meeting to remind myself to share at least one idea.

Consultant: Great idea! Having that reminder can boost your confidence. As you work on this, be sure to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. What do you think you’ll notice in yourself as you continue to share in groups?

User: I hope I'll feel more confident and maybe even enjoy the interactions more. I really want to become more comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Embracing the possibility of enjoyment is important. As you move forward, what steps can you take to celebrate your successes, even the small ones?

User: I think I could treat myself to something nice after each meeting if I share something. That sounds motivating!

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to reinforce positive behavior! It sounds like you’re finding ways to support your progress in social settings. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the improvements you’ve made in your social skills so far?

User: I think I’m starting to see some progress! I feel hopeful that I can keep improving and be more social.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Little P! Recognizing your growth is a significant step toward building your confidence. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and being kind to yourself along the way. If you encounter challenges, remind yourself of how far you’ve come.

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep that in mind. I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of your commitment to growing. We’ll continue to build on these skills together. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, P! It's great to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I’ve made some progress in my social skills, especially during the group projects. Some of my classmates have even complimented my contributions.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful achievement! Feeling recognized by your peers can be very validating. Can you share more about how these interactions have felt for you?

User: Sure! It feels nice to be appreciated and included. I used to dread these group projects, but now I find myself participating more actively. It’s like my anxiety is lessening.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're starting to embrace these opportunities. What specific changes do you think have contributed to your increased confidence?

User: I think I’ve been practicing talking to people more, even just small things like asking questions in class or chatting with classmates during breaks. It helps me feel more engaged.

Consultant: Engaging in small conversations can indeed make a big difference. How do you feel about your ability to initiate conversations now, compared to before?

User: I still feel a bit nervous at times, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. I can approach people now without feeling like I'm going to freeze.

Consultant: That’s a substantial improvement, P! It seems like you're building a solid foundation. Have there been any specific situations recently where you felt your social anxiety creep in again?

User: Yes, there was a networking event last week. I was really anxious before going, but I pushed myself to attend. I managed to talk to a few people, but I felt out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: Attending a networking event is a big step! How did you cope with that anxiety while you were there?

User: I reminded myself that everyone else was probably feeling nervous too. I tried to focus on the conversation rather than on my anxiety, which helped a bit.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Reminding yourself that you're not alone in your feelings can be very empowering. How did you feel after the event ended?

User: I felt relieved that I went, even though it was difficult. I think I learned something about pushing through my discomfort.

Consultant: It's excellent that you recognized the value in facing your discomfort. What would you say is one thing you learned about yourself during that experience?

User: I learned that I can manage my anxiety better than I thought. Just taking that step made me feel more capable.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Do you have any plans for your next steps in continuing to build your social skills?

User: I’d like to keep attending these events and maybe practice even more with friends. I think I can also start engaging in more group activities to expand my comfort zone.

Consultant: Those sound like productive steps! Practicing with friends can provide a supportive environment to refine your skills. Is there a specific group activity you’re considering?

User: Maybe joining a club or participating in study groups more frequently. I think it would help me interact with different people in a low-pressure setting.

Consultant: Joining clubs or study groups can definitely provide a great way to connect with others. Would you feel comfortable setting a goal for how often you'd like to engage in these activities?

User: I think I could aim for one new group activity each week, starting next week. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic and achievable goal! How do you feel about tracking your experiences after each group activity to reflect on your progress?

User: I think that would help me see how I’m improving. It would also give me something to discuss in our next sessions!

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce your growth and help identify areas for continued improvement. As we wrap up today’s session, what is the most significant insight you gained about yourself?

User: I realized that I’m more capable of managing social situations than I previously believed. Each little success adds to my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, P! Building on your successes can create a positive feedback loop for further growth. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you're doing great, and it's normal to have ups and downs. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about my journey now, and I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you. Take care, and I can't wait to hear all about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little P! It's great to see you again. Today, let's take a moment to reflect on the progress you've made since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more confident. The positive feedback from my tutor and classmates has really helped. I still have some social anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming as it was before.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant strides in your confidence. Can you share some specific instances where you felt this increase in confidence in social situations?

User: Sure! I participated in a group project recently, and I was able to contribute my ideas during discussions. It felt good to share my thoughts without feeling too anxious.

Consultant: That’s an important achievement! Engaging in group discussions can be challenging, especially with social anxiety. How did you feel during and after sharing your thoughts with your group?

User: During the discussion, I felt a bit nervous, but once I started talking, I actually felt relieved and proud of myself afterward. I was surprised by how well it went.

Consultant: It sounds like you handled that situation very well, and it's great to see that you felt relief and pride afterward. Reflecting on this experience, what do you think helped you manage your anxiety while speaking in the group?

User: I think I prepared my points ahead of time, which made me feel more secure. Also, the supportive environment helped a lot; my classmates were encouraging.

Consultant: Preparation and a supportive environment are both powerful tools for managing anxiety. As you continue to build on this progress, let's think about how you can apply these strategies in new social situations. Are there any upcoming opportunities where you could practice further?

User: Yes, there's a networking event next week. I’m a bit worried about it, but I want to try to attend.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re willing to push yourself to attend the networking event. What specific concerns do you have about this event?

User: I’m worried I might struggle to start conversations with strangers. What if people aren’t friendly or if I run out of things to say?

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, and many people feel the same way in new social situations. Let’s explore some strategies together. How about we brainstorm a few conversation starters or topics you could use when meeting new people?

User: That sounds helpful! I think something about our studies or recent news could work.

Consultant: Excellent! Starting with topics like studies or news can serve as common ground. Additionally, inviting others to share their thoughts on those topics can ease the pressure. Do you feel comfortable practicing a few of these starters with me now?

User: Sure! Okay, let’s see… "What do you think about the recent changes in our curriculum?" 

Consultant: That's a great start! It invites discussion and shows your engagement with your studies. How about another one?

User: How about, "Have you worked on any interesting projects lately?" 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s another excellent choice. You're doing well at crafting open-ended questions. Now, let's think about how to handle moments where the conversation might stall or if you feel unsure of what to say next.

User: That’s a good point. I usually panic a bit and go quiet.

Consultant: That’s natural. Instead of panicking, you can take a deep breath and remember that it's okay to have brief pauses in conversation. If you find the chat slowing down, you can always ask for the other person's opinion on something related to what you've discussed. Would you like to practice that approach?

User: Yeah, I like that idea. Maybe something like, "What do you think about the way our department handles projects?"

Consultant: Exactly! That's a smooth way to keep the conversation flowing. Now focusing on your progress, how do you feel about your ability to face this networking event compared to when we first started our sessions?

User: I feel much better prepared. I still have some nerves, but I think I can handle it better.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! Acknowledging your nerves but still feeling prepared shows your growth. Let's summarize! You’ve developed strategies for conversation, recognized your strengths in group settings, and planned to apply these strategies at the event. Do you feel ready to take on this challenge?

User: Yes, I do! I’m feeling a lot more optimistic about it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, it's okay to feel a bit anxious, and what matters is how you respond. As we conclude today's session, let’s discuss how you can continue to build on these skills after the networking event. What plans do you have?

User: I think I want to keep practicing my conversation skills. Maybe by joining more group activities or clubs at university.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Continuously engaging in social activities will help reinforce your skills and boost your confidence. I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I believe you can manage your anxiety going forward. If you need support, remember I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It has been a pleasure working with you, and I'm excited about your journey ahead. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye! I will keep in touch!
