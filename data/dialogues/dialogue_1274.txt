Consultant: Hi Mickey! I'm really glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately, especially at school?

User: Hi. I've been feeling sort of angry and sad. Sometimes my feelings just explode, and I don't know why. Now some kids don’t want to play with me.

Consultant: I see that you're feeling lots of strong emotions, and it’s tough to see your friends pulling away. Let’s start by talking about what's been happening before those feelings come up. Can you share one time when you felt really upset recently?

User: Well, last week I was playing tag. I was trying to have fun, but I got tagged, and I just felt super angry and started yelling. Then everyone looked at me funny and didn't want to play anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like being tagged made you really upset, and yelling felt like the only way to express that. I want to understand better—what kind of thoughts went through your head in that moment? 

User: I thought it was unfair. I didn’t want to lose, and I felt like no one liked me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really hard to deal with. Feeling like you’re not liked can make anyone feel angry or sad. Let’s explore this together. When you think "no one likes me," how does that make you feel in your body?

User: My stomach feels tight, and I feel hot, like I'm going to explode!

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. We want to help you find ways to feel better when those thoughts come up. Can we think about something that can help you calm down when you start feeling that tightness?

User: Maybe if I had a way to take a break or cool down when I get mad. That might help.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Taking a break or finding a way to cool down can help you manage those feelings. What’s something you think could help you when you're starting to feel upset?

User: I could breathe deeply or count to ten. My mom taught me that.

Consultant: Deep breathing and counting to ten are wonderful strategies! They can help you calm down. How about we practice that together now? 

User: Okay, I’ll try it!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... and out. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a little better. I like the breathing part.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Breathing can be a really helpful tool. Now, let’s talk about how we can recognize those big feelings before they explode. What do you think could be a sign that you’re starting to feel angry or sad?

User: Maybe when I start getting upset over small things or when my heart races.

Consultant: Yes, recognizing those signs is so important! If you notice your heart racing or getting upset easily, that can be a signal for you to use your breathing or take a break. How do you think your friends would react if you told them you needed a moment to calm down?

User: They might understand, but I’m scared they’ll still think I’m weird.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about how others see you. Do you think it might help to share with a close friend how you feel about your emotions? 

User: Maybe... but what if they don’t understand?

Consultant: That’s a possibility, but sometimes sharing can help them understand you better. You might find that some kids could be kinder than you expect. What if we practice what you could say to your friend? 

User: Okay, I could say I get really upset sometimes and need to take a break.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You’re letting them know what you need. It’s brave to communicate your feelings. How do you feel about trying that the next time you're with your friends?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I might try.

Consultant: Perfect! Feeling nervous is okay, but it’s great that you’re willing to give it a shot. Remember, practice makes perfect, and it’s okay to take small steps. 

User: Yeah, small steps sound good.

Consultant: Absolutely! So, as we focus on your emotions, let’s also think about how you can create a more fun experience with your friends. What are some games or activities you enjoy that you could suggest next time?

User: I like playing with blocks and drawing.

Consultant: Those are fun options! Suggesting activities like building or drawing gives you a chance to share joy with your friends without the pressure of games that might make you feel upset. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I can invite them to draw with me!

Consultant: Excellent idea, Mickey! Drawing together can help you connect more calmly with your friends. Now, as we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What do you think is one important thing you want to remember from our session today?

User: I want to remember to breathe and tell my friends I need a break if I get mad.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! Remember, being able to express your needs and using your breathing techniques can really help you. I’m proud of you for working on this! 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mickey! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this—I'm here to support you. 

User: Bye! See you next time!

Consultant: Bye, Mickey! Take care, and I can’t wait to hear from you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mickey! I'm happy to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I don’t know, it’s been tough. I really don’t want to go to school anymore, especially after what happened with that classmate.

Consultant: I can understand why you feel that way. It sounds like the conflict has made school feel really uncomfortable for you. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: We were playing a game, and I thought I was winning, but then he got mad and said some mean things. I just wanted to play and have fun, but now I just want to stay home.

Consultant: It must have felt really hurtful when he said those things. Sometimes, conflicts can make us feel like we don’t want to be around others. Do you think that experience has affected how you see social activities now?

User: Yeah, I feel like nobody wants to play with me. I don't want to get hurt again.

Consultant: That makes sense, Mickey. It’s normal to feel scared of getting hurt again after a conflict. Instead of avoiding these situations, we could work together on how to face them. How would you feel about trying to join a small group activity again?

User: I guess I could try. But I’m really scared. 

Consultant: That's okay to feel scared! Let's think of it as a fun challenge. We can practice some ways to communicate with others. For example, what would you say to a friend if you wanted to join a game?

User: Maybe I could say, “Can I play too?” But what if they say no?

Consultant: That’s a great start! And it’s possible they might say no, but they could also say yes. Having those thoughts can make us feel nervous. Let’s think about how you could respond positively if someone says no.

User: I guess I could say, “Okay, maybe another time.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That shows that you’re still friendly and open, even if they don’t want to play right then. It’s about building your confidence. How do you think you might feel if you practiced this a few times?

User: I’m not sure. I might feel better or maybe just more nervous.

Consultant: Both feelings are completely normal. Practicing might give you more confidence, but it’s okay to feel a bit nervous at the same time. What do you think could help you cope with those nerves in the moment?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and count to three?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Breathing can help calm our nerves. Why don't we practice that together? Imagine you’re about to ask to join a game, let’s take a deep breath in... and out together.

User: Okay... Inhale... exhale. 

Consultant: Great job! How did that feel for you?

User: A little better. I think if I practice, I can be okay.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Mickey! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. What else do you think could help you feel more prepared for joining an activity at school?

User: Maybe I could try talking to a teacher first to see what they think?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Teachers can help a lot. They might even encourage you to join a group. How would you like to approach your teacher, and what could you say?

User: I could ask them if they know anyone who needs a player. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Reaching out for support is a great strategy. It’s like building your own little safety net. How does that make you feel thinking about getting that support?

User: It sounds nice because I won’t be alone.

Consultant: Absolutely, knowing you have support can make a big difference! In our next session, we can talk about how it went, and we can keep practicing those skills. Does that sound good?

User: Yeah, I would like that. It’s nice to practice.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Mickey. You're doing an amazing job! Remember, it’s okay to take your time and practice can help make things easier. 

User: Thanks! I’ll try to practice this week.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. Just remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You’re on the right track!

User: Bye! See you next time!

Consultant: Bye, Mickey! Take care, and I’ll see you soon!

Consultant: Hi Mickey! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling kind of frustrated. I got in trouble in class because I couldn’t pay attention, and now I don't want to go to school anymore.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what happened in class that made you feel this way?

User: The teacher said I was not focusing and that I needed to try harder. I felt really embarrassed and just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really uncomfortable situation for you. It’s normal to feel embarrassed when people expect more from us. What do you think you could do the next time you feel like you can’t focus in class?

User: I don't know... Maybe just zone out again? I feel like it doesn’t matter.

Consultant: I hear you, Mickey. It feels like zoning out is easier, but it might not help you in the long run. Let’s think about some ways to help you focus better. What’s one thing that usually helps you pay attention?

User: Sometimes when I’m home, if I take a break, I can concentrate better. But at school, I can’t do that.

Consultant: Taking breaks sounds like a good idea! At school, we could think about small tricks to take mini breaks without leaving your seat. Would you be interested in trying that next time?

User: Yeah, I guess that might help. But what if the teacher doesn’t let me?

Consultant: That’s a good question. If you're worried about the teacher's reaction, we can think of ways to talk to them about it, maybe ask for permission to use some strategies that might help you focus. Would it feel okay to speak with your teacher about this?

User: Maybe. But what if they think I'm just making excuses?

Consultant: That’s understandable to be worried about that. How about we practice what you could say? You could explain that you find focusing challenging and need a little help. What do you think about that approach?

User: Hmm, that could work. I could just say that to her.

Consultant: Exactly! You could say, “I sometimes struggle to stay focused, and I think taking short breaks might help me.” It’s important to express how you feel. Now, aside from school, how have you been feeling at home lately?

User: I got into a fight with my brother over a video game. I was really angry.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel upset. It’s okay to feel angry sometimes. How did you handle that situation with your brother?

User: I shouted at him, and then he shouted back. It was just really annoying.

Consultant: Shouting can happen when we’re upset. Sometimes it feels good to let it out, but I wonder if there might be ways to handle it that help you feel better afterward. What do you think?

User: I guess I could just walk away instead. But I still get really mad sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Walking away can give you a moment to calm down. It’s also okay to feel mad; it’s about what we do with that feeling. Have you noticed when you feel angry, what usually happens next?

User: I just feel like a volcano that explodes. But after, I feel bad.

Consultant: That’s a powerful image, Mickey—a volcano can erupt when there’s too much pressure. When you do explode, what do you think helps you cool down afterward?

User: I usually just go to my room and play games.

Consultant: Gaming can be a good way to distract yourself. But let’s think of some other calming techniques, too. What about taking deep breaths or counting to ten before reacting when you feel angry?

User: Breathing sounds okay. I can try that.

Consultant: Awesome! Breathing can help you feel more in control. So, let’s summarize some of the techniques we’ve talked about today: Taking mini breaks for focus, talking to your teacher, and using breathing when you feel anger. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel like I can try that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to have ups and downs. I’m here to support you, and we’ll work through this together. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel a bit better. I think I can do this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to look at it, Mickey! I believe in you, and I’m excited to see how you can apply these strategies. For our next session, let’s talk about how it goes using these skills. You're doing great!

User: Okay, thanks! I’ll try to remember all of this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mickey! Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to share your experiences next time. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Mickey! I'm really glad you’re here today. I know you had some feelings after that little argument with Kevin at the family gathering. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi. I'm still a little angry about it, but I also think it was nice that Kevin said sorry. It made me feel a bit better.

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing both your feelings of anger and the positive step Kevin took to apologize. That’s a great insight! Can you tell me more about what made you feel angry during the argument?

User: I got really upset when he didn't share the game with me. I wanted to play too, but he kept saying no. 

Consultant: I see. It’s tough when you want to join in, and it feels frustrating when someone isn't being fair. How did you feel after the argument was over and Kevin apologized?

User: I felt a little better because he wanted to make things okay. But I still didn’t like that we fought.

Consultant: That makes sense. Conflicts can be hard, even if they get resolved. Let’s think about what you could do next time you feel that way. If you were to play that moment over again, how would you want to express your feelings to Kevin?

User: I think I would tell him I felt really sad when he wouldn’t let me play. 

Consultant: That's a really good approach, expressing your feelings is important! What do you think Kevin would say if you told him that?

User: I think he would understand and maybe let me play. 

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing how you feel could help him see your side. Now, let's try a little role-playing. I can be you, and you can be Kevin. How would you start the conversation?

User: Um… I would say, “Kevin, I felt sad when you didn’t let me play. Can we find a way to play together?”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to start! By using “I” statements, you're letting him know how you feel without blaming him. How do you think he might respond?

User: He might say, “Okay, let’s play together!” 

Consultant: I love that positive response! It seems like you understand the importance of communicating. What other feelings might you want to express if something similar happens again?

User: Maybe if I feel left out, I could tell someone else too, like mom or dad. 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Involving parents can help, too. They can support you in figuring things out. If you practice this communication, how do you think it will change your relationship with Kevin?

User: I think it will be better. We can talk instead of fighting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Talking things through can lead to more understanding between you two. Now, let’s think about after the argument—how could you remind yourself that it’s okay to express your feelings?

User: Maybe I can make a chart to remember to talk and not shout.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! A chart can help you keep track of how you're feeling and what responses you want to use. How can we make that chart fun?

User: I can draw happy and sad faces or use colors!

Consultant: That's creative, Mickey! Making it colorful and fun can help you remember to look at it. Now that you've thought through these strategies, how do you feel about expressing your emotions in the future?

User: I feel more confident! Talking seems easier now.

Consultant: That's really wonderful to hear! Feeling more confident is a great achievement. As we wrap up today, what’s the most important thing you've learned about handling your feelings and talking to Kevin?

User: I learned that it’s okay to say how I feel, and it can help us get along better.

Consultant: Exactly! That will help you a lot moving forward. Remember, it's alright to share your emotions. You did an amazing job today, Mickey! I believe you can keep practicing these skills. If you encounter any more challenges, you can come back and we can work through them together. 

User: Thanks! I feel happy about this. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad you're feeling happy. Keep practicing, and I can’t wait to hear how it goes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mickey! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. When I was at my friend's house, I showed them how to make some origami, and they really liked it!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you felt proud when your friends appreciated your origami skills. How did that make you feel inside?

User: I felt really happy and kind of like I was good at something. It was nice to show them what I can do.

Consultant: It's great that you had such a positive experience sharing your talent. Have you thought about how you could share your origami skills with others, maybe at school?

User: I haven't really thought about it much. I'm a bit scared of what other kids might say.

Consultant: I understand that it can be a bit scary to share your talents. But remember, sharing your skills might lead to more friends appreciating you just like your friend's family did. What do you think would happen if you tried it?

User: Maybe they would like it too! I just worry they might not think it’s cool.

Consultant: It's totally normal to worry about what others think, but many people enjoy seeing something unique and fun, like origami! What if you practiced showing it to someone in your family first? 

User: I could show it to my mom or dad. They always say nice things.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! How would you feel about showing them a new origami design you learned?

User: I think I would feel excited! I want to see their faces when they see it.

Consultant: Excitement is a fantastic feeling! It sounds like you really enjoy sharing your skills. Let's think about how you can use that excitement when you show it to your mom and dad. 

User: Yeah, I can practice before I show them.

Consultant: Practicing will definitely help you feel more confident. How about after you show them, we can talk about it next time? I’d love to hear how it went!

User: Okay! That sounds good! I can’t wait!

Consultant: Awesome! You’re doing such a great job recognizing your feelings. Let’s also think about how you might feel supported when you show your friends at school. 

User: Maybe I can ask my best friend to join me so I’m not alone.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Having a friend with you can make things feel easier. How do you think your friend would respond if you asked them?

User: I think he’d be excited. He likes cool things too!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Collaborating with friends can create a supportive environment. How else do you think this could help you feel more comfortable sharing your skills at school?

User: If they like it, then I won't feel so bad. It would be fun to do it together.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing this fun experience together will help both of you feel more confident. Let’s try to think of a time next week when you can show your origami at school. 

User: Maybe during art class! We could even make it a group project!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Mickey! A group project where everyone can learn together. How does that make you feel about sharing your skills?

User: I feel proud! It’s like I can lead my friends in something fun.

Consultant: You should feel proud! You have a unique skill, and leading a project shows confidence in yourself. How might you remind yourself of this feeling when you feel nervous before sharing?

User: I can think about how much fun we’ll have, and that my friends liked my origami before.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder! Keep that thought close to you. Let’s also talk about how you can manage any nerves that might come up. Would you like to share what makes you nervous before showing something?

User: I just feel like I might mess up or they won't like it.

Consultant: That’s a common worry! It’s okay to feel that way. What might you say to yourself to shift that thought into something more encouraging when you feel nervous?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to have fun.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the process is what's most important. Remember, everybody makes mistakes, and that's how we learn. What else can we work on today to help you feel even more prepared?

User: I think I could think of more origami to show. Like, I want to learn how to do a crane!

Consultant: Learning a crane sounds like a fantastic goal! It’s a classic piece that many people love. Would you like to set a plan to learn that and show your family next?

User: Yes! I can find some videos to watch and then practice.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! You’re taking steps to build your skills and confidence. How do you feel about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel happy and more ready to show everyone my origami! 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made great progress in recognizing your emotions and planning how to share your talents. Remember that you have unique abilities, and it’s wonderful to share them with the world. 

User: Thank you! I can’t wait for next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing all about your experiences. Keep practicing and remember, it’s all about having fun! Take care, Mickey, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Mickey! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better. I got to share a little more in my group activities at school, and it was nice to see my classmates and teacher respond positively.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Mickey! It seems like you're becoming more comfortable sharing your thoughts. How did it feel to receive that positive feedback?

User: It felt really good! I was a bit nervous at first, but when they smiled and said nice things, I felt proud of myself.

Consultant: It's great to hear you felt proud! Recognizing your own achievements is really important. Can you tell me more about what you've been sharing with your group?

User: I shared a story about my vacation. I was nervous because I didn’t want to mess up, but it turned out they liked it!

Consultant: Sharing a personal story takes a lot of courage, especially when you're worried about messing up. What do you think helped you to feel more at ease when you shared your story?

User: I guess I practiced a little bit before. My mother helped me by listening and asking questions, which made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy—practicing and getting support from your mom. It sounds like she really helps you prepare. How do you think that practice affected how you communicated in the group?

User: I think it helped me remember important parts of the story, and I told it better than I thought I would.

Consultant: Definitely! Practicing can really boost your confidence. What do you think you could do next time to help you feel just as confident or even more so?

User: Maybe I could practice another story again. Or I could ask my friends what they think about my ideas before I share them.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Practicing and getting feedback can help you feel more secure before sharing. What goals would you like to set for yourself moving forward in your group activities?

User: I want to share more often and maybe even ask questions to my classmates. I think I can do that.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Mickey! Asking questions can help you connect even more with your classmates. How do you feel about setting a specific number of times you want to share or ask questions in the next few weeks?

User: Maybe I can try to share at least once a week and ask one question.

Consultant: That sounds really achievable! Sharing once a week and asking one question can help you grow your confidence. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel excited! It seems like a good way to keep practicing.

Consultant: Excitement is a perfect feeling to have when you're trying something new! Let's also think about the support system around you. What have your parents and teachers done to help you feel more confident so far?

User: My parents encourage me and my teachers are really nice. They smile and give us thumbs up during presentations.

Consultant: It's so crucial to have supportive people around you—a smiling teacher is a huge confidence booster! How do you think you can keep that support alive as you work toward your goals?

User: I could keep telling my parents about my school activities and how I feel.

Consultant: Communicating with your parents is a great idea! It helps them understand your journey, and they can celebrate your successes with you. What do you think might be some challenges you could face while trying to achieve your goals?

User: I might feel shy or nervous again. Sometimes I get worried about speaking in front of others.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel shy or nervous, especially when speaking in front of people. What techniques can you use to manage those feelings when they come up?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Deep breathing and self-talk about making mistakes are fantastic strategies! They can help you stay calm. Let’s also create a visual reminder. What could you use to remind you of these techniques when you're feeling nervous?

User: Maybe I can draw a picture of me speaking confidently and hang it by my desk!

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! A visual reminder can be very powerful. As we wrap up, can you reflect on how far you've come since we started these sessions?

User: I’ve told stories in front of my class and felt good about it. I’m more confident now.

Consultant: You've made remarkable progress, Mickey! Remember how practice and support helped you. How will you continue to build on these skills moving forward?

User: I will keep practicing and telling my parents about my experiences.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! You have everything it takes to keep growing. This was our final session for now, and I want you to know you can always return if you need help in the future. Keep celebrating your successes, Mickey!

User: Thank you! I will remember to do that. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Mickey, and take care! You’ve got this!
