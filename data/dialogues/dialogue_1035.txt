Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. I’m glad you’re here. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling lately? What have you been experiencing?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down. Since I started at this new school, I've been struggling with my grades, and my classmates laugh at me. It’s just been tough to fit in, and I dread talking to anyone.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you’re feeling quite isolated and sensitive to others’ opinions, especially your classmates. Can you tell me more about how their comments make you feel?

User: Well, it just makes me feel even worse about myself. I already feel like I’m not good enough, and hearing them laugh makes me feel like I don’t belong anywhere.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re facing those challenges. What thoughts go through your mind when you hear those comments from your classmates?

User: I think things like “I will never be as good as them” or “they probably all think I'm a loser.” It just spirals from there.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and negative. Let’s explore them a bit. How much do you believe those thoughts when they come up? Are there moments when you feel differently about yourself?

User: I guess I know deep down that I have some strengths, but it’s hard to remember them when I'm feeling low. It’s like those negative voices drown out everything else.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed by those negative beliefs. Would it help to discuss what strengths you do recognize about yourself, even if it feels challenging right now?

User: I used to enjoy drawing, and my teachers always said I had potential in that. But I barely do it now because I just feel so bad about everything.

Consultant: It’s great that you have that passion for drawing! That’s definitely a strength. What if we try to incorporate more of that into your life again? It could be a way to express yourself and perhaps feel a little better about your situation.

User: I’m not sure. I feel like I wouldn't be good at it anymore. What if I just fail again?

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about failing, especially when you’re feeling insecure. But remember, trying something without the pressure of perfection can actually be freeing. What if you allowed yourself to draw, even just for fun, without judging the outcome?

User: That sounds nice, but I just don’t feel like I have the time or energy right now with all the studying I need to do.

Consultant: Balancing everything can be overwhelming, especially with school pressures. But even a small break for drawing could refresh your mind. How would you feel about trying to schedule short sessions for it? Perhaps it could help relieve some stress.

User: I guess a little break might help. I just have this fear that it’ll take away from my studying time.

Consultant: I understand that concern. But often, when we allow ourselves a break, we can return to our tasks with greater focus. Let’s challenge the idea that taking time for yourself is a waste. Do you think it might be possible to experiment with this idea?

User: Maybe. I can try to think of it as a reward for getting some studying done, like a treat.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! As you consider this, how about we also discuss ways to cope with your classmates' reactions when they mock you? It might be helpful to have some strategies ready.

User: I really don’t know what to do. I just feel like I want to disappear when they laugh.

Consultant: That’s a very understandable reaction. One thing we can explore is what you could say or think in those moments that allows you to feel more empowered. For instance, something like “Their opinions don’t define my worth” could be a powerful reminder.

User: I’ve never thought of saying that to myself. I usually just stay quiet and feel ashamed.

Consultant: It’s common to withdraw when we feel hurt. However, affirming your worth can slowly help shift your perspective. Maybe we could practice some responses together to help you feel more prepared.

User: That could help. I just need to believe it more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Believing takes practice. How about you write down a couple of these affirmations and read them to yourself? You could also share with me how it feels to say them out loud.

User: That’s a good idea. I’ll try doing that.

Consultant: Wonderful! We’re taking steps. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As we move forward, how can we work on your communication with teachers and parents, especially when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

User: I don’t talk to them much about how I feel. I guess I just assume they won’t understand.

Consultant: I see. It can be intimidating to open up. What if we brainstormed some ways to express your feelings to them? They might surprise you with their support.

User: I think I could start by just telling them I’m struggling and need a little help. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent first step! You might be pleasantly surprised by their willingness to help. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable initiating that conversation?

User: Maybe writing down what I want to say first would help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Preparing ahead can alleviate some anxiety. Let’s summarize what we've discussed today: exploring your strengths, managing thoughts about negative comments, encouraging communication, and adding some creative breaks. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds like a lot, but I feel a bit hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s progress. As we wrap up today, remember that it’s a journey, and by acknowledging these small changes, you’re building a path toward a more confident you. What’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to try those affirmations and maybe draw a little too. 

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful plan! Embrace these practices, and we can explore how they went next time. Remember, I’m here to support you along this journey.

User: Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Looking forward to our next conversation. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, it’s great to see you again! I understand you’ve been feeling quite pressured with your recent exam results. Can you share more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I feel really down. I got my mid-term exam results, and they were not good at all. I can tell my teachers are disappointed, and I feel like I'm letting my parents down too. It just makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I can see how disappointing results can really affect your mood and self-esteem, especially with the expectations surrounding you. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts have been on your mind since getting your results?

User: I've been thinking that maybe I’m just not smart enough. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever be able to catch up with my classmates. It feels so hopeless.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, feeling hopeless about your abilities. When these thoughts come to you, how do they make you feel emotionally? 

User: I feel anxious and really sad. Sometimes I just want to shut down and not think about school at all. I avoid talking to my teachers because I fear they'll judge me.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to avoid situations that make you feel anxious. Let’s explore those feelings a bit. You mentioned that you think you're not smart enough—can you think of any evidence that contradicts that thought?

User: Well, I did manage to pass some subjects last semester and got decent grades in those. But those feel like just one-off successes. 

Consultant: It sounds like you do have moments of success, even if they feel isolated. What would you say if a friend were in your position and thinking the same way about themselves?

User: I’d tell them that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective. It’s interesting how we can be more compassionate toward others than ourselves. What if we tried to apply that same kindness to your own situation? 

User: I guess I could try to think of my past successes more often. But it’s just hard when everyone seems to be doing better than me.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be tough seeing others succeed when you’re struggling. Let's try to identify some specific achievements or strengths of yours. Can you recall any skills or accomplishments you’re proud of, no matter how small?

User: I enjoy drawing and have received compliments from my art teacher, which makes me feel good. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Creativity is a great strength and can also be a valuable outlet for your feelings. How might finding some time to engage in art help you cope with your academic pressures?

User: It might help me relax and take my mind off things for a while. But I still worry that if I spend time on that, I won’t study enough.

Consultant: It’s a valid concern to want to balance your time well. What if we designed a plan where you could dedicate time to both studying and drawing? How would that look for you?

User: Maybe I could set aside an hour for art and then study for a couple of hours afterward. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! By introducing that balance, it could alleviate some of your stress. During your study time, have you thought about specific techniques you could use to make studying feel less daunting?

User: I haven’t really thought about that, but I sometimes find it hard to focus because I get distracted easily.

Consultant: Distractions can definitely make studying harder. We can try breaking your study time into shorter bursts, like 25-minute focused sessions followed by short breaks. This method can really help increase concentration. Would you be willing to try that?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can manage that. 

Consultant: Great! How might implementing this study method positively affect your thoughts and feelings about your abilities?

User: Maybe if I see some progress with my studying, I’ll feel more confident and less anxious. 

Consultant: That’s a positive way to look at it! Along with these adjustments, let’s talk a bit about communication with your teachers and parents. How do you feel about opening up to them about how you’re feeling?

User: I’m not sure. I’m afraid they’ll just add more pressure on me if I tell them I’m struggling. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear that reaction, but communicating can also foster understanding. What if you approached your teachers or parents with specific questions about how to improve, instead of just revealing your struggles? 

User: That could work. I guess asking for help is better than suffering in silence.

Consultant: Absolutely! It shows strength when you seek out support. Let’s consider how you might phrase that when you decide to talk to them. 

User: Maybe something like, “I’ve been having a tough time understanding the material and I really want to do better. Can you help me?” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! It shows your willingness to improve. How does it feel to think about approaching them this way?

User: It feels a bit less scary, I guess. At least they would know I’m trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about taking that first step. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you are leaving with that feels helpful?

User: I think I’ll focus on my strengths, communicate better with my teachers, and try this balanced study plan. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful actually. Thank you for the guidance!

Consultant: You’re welcome! It's been a pleasure talking with you, and I'm hopeful for the positive changes ahead. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit lonely and confused. Recently, during a group project in class, I sensed that my classmates were acting distant. I couldn't help but think that it was because of me, which left me feeling even more self-conscious and insecure.

Consultant: I can understand how that must feel for you. It’s tough when you’re in a group and feel like you’re not connecting. Can you share more about the project and the specific interactions that made you feel this way?

User: Well, during the discussions, I noticed they weren't really including me. They seemed to be making decisions without asking for my input. I started doubting myself—wondering if they didn't want me there because I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like those experiences in the project made you feel excluded and led to a lot of self-doubt. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt left out?

User: I just kept thinking that maybe I'm annoying or that I don’t contribute anything meaningful. I thought they might be avoiding me because they think I’m not as capable as they are.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s really common to jump to those kinds of conclusions about ourselves when we feel left out. Have you ever considered that there might be other explanations for their behavior?

User: I guess so, but it’s hard not to take it personally. I tend to think people are judging me quickly based on my past experiences with moving schools and my struggles with making friends.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Our past experiences can shape how we perceive current situations. Let’s take a moment to reflect on those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates think less of you? 

User: I don't really have any solid evidence. It's just a feeling that’s been built up over time. But I do wonder if they talk about me behind my back. 

Consultant: Those feelings can feel very real, but it's important to challenge them a bit. If a friend of yours were in the same situation, what do you think you would tell them about their thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn’t assume the worst and that maybe their classmates are just focused on their own tasks. But I can't seem to use the same logic on myself.

Consultant: That’s a great point! It sounds like you’re really insightful about other people's experiences. Let's try applying that perspective to your situation. How about we brainstorm some alternative explanations for your classmates' behavior? 

User: Maybe they were just really busy and didn’t realize I felt excluded? I suppose I could have spoken up too instead of assuming they didn’t want me involved.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking a step to express your feelings can be a constructive way to bridge that gap. It helps to recognize that their actions might not be about you, but rather their own distractions or pressures. How does that shift in thinking feel for you?

User: It feels a bit relieving, actually. I suppose I do need to remind myself that not everything is about me. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy realization! Now, let’s think about how you can apply this new understanding in future social situations. What could you do differently next time you sense that distance from others?

User: Maybe I could try to reach out more, or initiate conversations instead of waiting for them to include me. That seems like a good way to see if they really are interested in collaborating.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant plan, Zhang! Taking initiative can really help you gauge their interest. It can also empower you to build those connections. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. I think I can work on being more proactive in social situations.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Additionally, let’s consider some small activities you can engage in to ease your way into these interactions. What kinds of activities do you feel comfortable doing in groups?

User: I enjoy group projects and also playing basketball with others, but I usually hang back and let others take charge.

Consultant: How about we set a goal for you to take a more active role in those settings? Perhaps you can suggest ideas during group discussions or even set up a casual basketball game some classmates can join?

User: I like that idea! I’ve always wanted to suggest a game but felt too shy. Maybe I could just ask one or two friends and see where it goes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Start small and build your confidence. If you find that you have fun, you can gradually invite more people as you feel comfortable. What do you think?

User: I think it sounds good. I can feel my anxiety easing a bit as we talk about this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, practicing these skills can take time, but with each step you take, you’ll likely find it becomes easier. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think understanding that how others act is often not about me has been really important. It helps me feel less self-critical and more open to reaching out.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Zhang! You’re making great strides. As we move forward, keep reminding yourself of this perspective, and don't hesitate to reach out when you feel overwhelmed. Lastly, what strategies do you think you can use to maintain your progress until our next session?

User: I can keep practicing reaching out and also write down any positive interactions I have. That would help me remember that not everyone thinks poorly of me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Tracking your progress and positive interactions can really help reinforce your self-esteem. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re on the right path. If you need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our talk today. I feel more ready to face things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing how things develop in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, I think. Participating in the extracurricular activity has been fun, but I still feel unsure about my place among others.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve been enjoying the activity! Feeling unsure is completely normal, especially when you’re trying something new. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy in those moments?

User: I like the team spirit and the way we all work together. It feels good to be part of something, but at times, I worry that I don't contribute enough.

Consultant: It sounds like being part of a team brings you joy, which is wonderful! But the worry about your contribution can sometimes overshadow that enjoyment. Can you share an example of when you felt you contributed positively to your team?

User: Well, last week I suggested an idea for our project, and people seemed to like it. That felt nice, but I still think I didn't help as much as others.

Consultant: Suggesting that idea was a significant contribution, and it’s encouraging that others liked it! Let's explore that feeling of not doing enough. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think you aren’t contributing enough?

User: I think that I'm not as smart or capable as the others, and it makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. It’s important for us to challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not capable? 

User: I mean, I do struggle with some subjects, and my grades aren’t great compared to my classmates.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but grades don't define your worth or capability in a group activity. If you think about it, how would you feel if a friend expressed those same doubts about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and that grades don’t reflect who they are.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have that wisdom within you. How might it feel to apply that same understanding to your own situation?

User: I guess it would help me feel a bit more relaxed and less pressured.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Let’s work together to create small social goals for you in this activity. What’s a simple step you could take this week that might help you feel more confident in your social interactions?

User: Maybe I can try to talk to someone new in the group or share another idea for our project.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Xiaozhang! Taking small steps can really help build your confidence. How do you feel about making that a goal for this week?

User: I feel good about it. I think talking to someone new could be a good way to start.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember to celebrate that step, no matter how small it may seem. How will you remind yourself to stay positive about this experience?

User: I could keep a small note with me that says, “You are capable and deserve to connect with others.”

Consultant: That’s a beautiful affirmation! It’s a great reminder of your worth and potential. How do you think reflecting on your accomplishments during the week will impact your feelings of self-doubt?

User: I think it could help me see myself differently, like I can actually be part of this group.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your successes, no matter how small, can really shift your perspective. Let’s also consider what support you can reach out to if those self-doubts creep in again. Who in your life can you talk to when you need encouragement?

User: I suppose I could talk to my parents or a close friend. They’ve always been supportive.

Consultant: Great! It’s important to have support during challenging times. As we wrap up today, how confident do you feel about implementing these small goals and using your support system?

User: I feel much more confident now. I'm ready to give it a try!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiaozhang! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, every small step counts. I look forward to hearing all about your experiences next time. Take care and keep embracing those opportunities!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. I received some positive feedback from my peers during a recent group project, which felt good. But I still worry about whether I can keep doing well socially.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and receiving positive feedback! It's a significant step forward. Let's talk a bit more about that worry. What specifically makes you feel unsure about maintaining that confidence in social situations?

User: I guess I'm just afraid that I won't be able to keep up the good interactions, or that I'll misinterpret social cues. Sometimes I feel like I might just be lucky.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about your ability to continue connecting with others, and you're worried that you might not fully understand the social signals around you. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you've felt this way?

User: During a recent study group, I thought I was contributing well, but then I noticed one of my classmates looking at me strangely. It made me doubt myself and wonder if I was being too much or saying the wrong things.

Consultant: I can see how that would create a sense of doubt for you. What were you thinking at that moment when you saw your classmate's reaction? And how did that make you feel?

User: I thought maybe I was annoying everyone with my contributions. It made me feel embarrassed and a little anxious.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel embarrassed in that situation, and it's common to worry about how others perceive us. Let’s explore that thought a bit further. Do you think it's possible that your classmate's reaction was influenced by their own feelings or experiences, rather than something you did wrong?

User: I hadn’t thought about it that way. Maybe they were just having a bad day or were confused about what I was saying.

Consultant: Exactly! Our perceptions can often be influenced by factors outside our control. When you notice those anxious thoughts, it might be helpful to remind yourself that not everything is a direct reflection of you. How does that realization make you feel?

User: It feels a bit relieving. I guess I don’t always have to take others' reactions so personally.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing that you don’t need to internalize others' expressions can help reduce anxiety. Let's work on developing a self-encouragement plan that you can use when you notice those doubtful thoughts creeping in. What would you like to remind yourself during those moments?

User: I think I could remind myself that I am doing my best and that people appreciate my contributions, as I’ve received positive feedback before.

Consultant: That's a fantastic affirmation to use! By acknowledging your efforts and the appreciation you've received, you can reinforce your confidence in social situations. How about we set a specific goal for you to practice this self-encouragement in your next social interaction?

User: That sounds good! I can try to remind myself of this during our next group study session.

Consultant: Excellent! Before that session, it might be beneficial to write down a few reminders or phrases that motivate you. What would be one phrase you could write down to help you stay positive during the interaction?

User: Maybe something like, "I have valuable things to contribute, and it’s okay to make mistakes."

Consultant: That's an empowering phrase! It promotes self-acceptance and encourages you to participate without fear. How do you feel about using that as a mantra during your next study session?

User: I feel pretty good about it! It gives me confidence to know I can remind myself of this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also think about what social situations you might want to explore further. Are there any activities coming up where you could challenge yourself to be more social?

User: There’s a school club fair next week. I was thinking of checking it out, but I’m a bit hesitant.

Consultant: The club fair sounds like a perfect opportunity! It can be a great way to meet new people and engage in activities that interest you. What could be a small goal for you during the fair?

User: Maybe I could talk to at least three different clubs and ask about what they do.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! It’s manageable and gives you a chance to engage without overwhelming pressure. How would you feel trying that?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself if I managed to do that, even if I felt nervous.

Consultant: Feeling proud is an excellent motivator! Remember, every small step you take in social situations contributes to your growth. As we wrap up today's session, let’s review what you've accomplished and set out a plan for your next steps. What do you feel has changed for you since we started?

User: I think I feel more capable and open to participating in social situations. I’m learning to trust myself more.

Consultant: That's a significant change! You're developing resilience and trust in your abilities. As you look ahead, what would you like your future goal to be concerning your social confidence?

User: I want to keep challenging myself to participate in more activities and slowly become more comfortable in new social situations.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Embracing those challenges will help fortify your social skills and confidence. Remember, you can always return to your self-encouragement phrases whenever you need a boost. Thank you for sharing today, Xiaozhang. You've made great progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and the strategies we discussed. I'm looking forward to trying them out!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling after our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling better, actually. The communication with my parents has improved, and I think it’s helping me. But I still feel a bit uncertain about my future.

Consultant: It's great to hear that communication with your parents is getting better! Feeling uncertain about the future is completely normal, especially during this time in your life. Can you share what specific aspects of your future you're feeling uncertain about?

User: Mostly about my studies and what I want to do after high school. I’m not confident about my grades, and I worry about whether I’ll even get into a good college.

Consultant: That’s a common concern among students. Let's focus on your strengths for a moment. Since we last spoke, what progress have you noticed in your studies or social interactions?

User: I’ve been trying to engage more in class, and I even participated in a group project. It felt good to contribute and interact more with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward! Engaging in class and participating in projects shows your willingness to challenge yourself. How did it feel for you to take that step?

User: It felt a bit scary at first, but once I started talking to my group, I realized I could share my ideas. It was nice to be included.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you felt included and saw the value in sharing your ideas. This shows your growing confidence. Moving forward, how do you envision maintaining this momentum in class?

User: I think I could set small goals for myself, like speaking up at least once in every class instead of disappearing.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Setting small and achievable goals can really help build your confidence gradually. Besides your studies, what other areas of your life are you looking to improve as you move forward?

User: I guess I want to make more friends. It’s tough for me because I usually prefer being alone.

Consultant: Wanting to make friends while also enjoying your own space is completely valid. What do you think could help you balance both?

User: Maybe I can try to join a club at school. It would let me meet new people in an environment where I can still keep my distance if I need to.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like an excellent idea! It gives you the opportunity to connect with others while you engage in an activity you enjoy. What type of club are you thinking about?

User: I’m considering the art club. I like drawing and it sounds like a great way to express myself.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Art can be a fantastic way to connect with others while showcasing your creativity. How do you feel about taking that step to join the art club?

User: I’m a bit nervous about meeting new people, but I really want to try.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous about stepping into new social situations. Remember, everyone in the club will likely have some nervousness too. Focusing on your interest in art may help ease those nerves. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I can focus on my passion and the reasons I want to join instead of the anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your passion is a great strategy. Let’s also talk about the feelings you have when you think about social situations. Can you describe what feelings come up for you?

User: I think I feel a mix of anxiety and excitement. I want to connect but I also worry about what others think of me.

Consultant: That mix of anxiety and excitement is really common. It shows that you care about making those connections. We can explore ways to manage those anxious feelings while maintaining your excitement for connections. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would. I want to handle my anxiety better.

Consultant: One approach we can try is grounding techniques. These are simple tools that help you focus on the present moment when you start feeling anxious. Would you like to learn more about them?

User: Sure! I’d like to know how I can use those techniques.

Consultant: A grounding technique could be as simple as focusing on your breathing or noticing your surroundings. For instance, you can take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out. It helps to bring your attention back when you feel overwhelmed. 

User: That sounds doable! I can practice my breathing.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Practicing that technique can help you feel calmer when facing social situations. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I want to set small goals for speaking in class, try joining the art club, and practice grounding techniques when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps that can help you build your confidence and manage your anxiety. Remember, it's a journey, and it's completely fine to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thank you! This really helps me see a clearer path.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiao Zhang! I'm so glad to see your progress. Our next session can focus on how these strategies are working for you and any new challenges you face. 

User: I'm looking forward to it! Thanks again for your help.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! Remember, you have the tools to continue developing your confidence and building connections. See you next time!
