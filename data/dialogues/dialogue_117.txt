Consultant: Hi Xiaoyu, it's good to see you today. I'm here to listen and help with anything you want to talk about. How have things been for you lately?

User: Hi. Well, things have been kind of tough. My mom has been really strict about studying because of the upcoming final exams. It makes me feel stressed, but I don't think I'm anxious. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like the pressure is coming from your mom's expectations, and that must be overwhelming at times. How does it make you feel when she becomes stricter about your studies?

User: It's frustrating. I feel like no matter how hard I try, it's never enough for her. But I don't think that's the reason why I sometimes feel uncomfortable before exams.

Consultant: I see. Perhaps we can explore this together. How do you feel when you're at school or when you're thinking about exams? 

User: Sometimes, I feel like I have a stomachache or a headache when exams are near. I guess it's annoying, but I can handle it. I think it's just normal stress.

Consultant: It's important to pay attention to how your body reacts to stress, even if it feels normal. What do you think would help you feel a bit less pressured about studying?

User: I don't know, maybe if my mom could understand that I'm trying my best. It feels like our conversations don't get anywhere.

Consultant: Communication can be tricky, especially when it feels like you're not being heard. How do you usually try to convey your feelings to your mom?

User: I try to tell her that I'm stressed, but she just wants me to study more. It's frustrating because I don't want to disappoint her.

Consultant: It sounds like you care a lot about her expectations, but also about sharing your own perspective. How do you think she might respond if you approach the conversation differently?

User: I really don't know. We always end up in the same arguments about studying more.

Consultant: Perhaps we could explore some new ways to communicate that might shift how these conversations go. What if you could express what you're feeling without fearing a negative response?

User: I suppose I could try, but I'm not sure how to start. It feels like every attempt just ends in misunderstandings.

Consultant: We could work through some techniques together. Imagine a situation where instead of it being about studying more, it was about understanding your feelings. How would that conversation start?

User: Maybe I could tell her how it makes me feel when she pressures me so much. Like, I'd appreciate it if she acknowledged my efforts instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a good step. Acknowledging your feelings and sharing your need for recognition can be a powerful way to change the dynamic. How do you think that would make you feel?

User: I guess it would feel nice to be recognized for what I am doing right. But I still wonder if she'd really listen.

Consultant: It's understandable to have that concern. Change takes time, and sometimes repeated efforts. It can help to consider what you can control in these interactions as well. How do you plan to support yourself during these conversations?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths and remind myself to stay calm. I tend to get worked up easily.

Consultant: That's a great technique. It can also help to have some phrases ready in your mind, something like "I feel ___ when ___ happens," to clearly express your feelings. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could try that next time. Maybe it would help me keep the conversation focused.

Consultant: Excellent. Having a way to structure your words can sometimes lead to more constructive discussions. Is there anything else about your situation with your mom that you would like to explore?

User: I just wish she could see things from my side sometimes. It's hard to tell her how much pressure I'm under without adding to it.

Consultant: It sounds like empathy is something you're looking for, and that's completely understandable. We can look into how these small changes might help guide the conversation toward that empathy. Would you like to work on a plan for your next conversation with her?

User: Yeah, I think that could be useful. I want to be able to talk to her without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: Great. Let’s think about a time when the atmosphere is more relaxed, perhaps at a moment when both of you aren't preoccupied with other things. When do you think would be ideal?

User: Maybe during dinner on a weekend. We might be more relaxed then compared to after a long school day.

Consultant: That sounds like a good opportunity. You might begin by sharing something you appreciate about the support she gives you, and then move on to your feelings and needs. How does that sound?

User: It sounds better than just starting off with my complaints. I think it might make a difference.

Consultant: Yes, sometimes starting with a positive note can make it easier to talk about challenging topics. Remember, this is a process, and every step is progress. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I'm willing to give it a shot. I really hope it helps.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. It's all about exploring new possibilities and seeing what works. How about we meet again to discuss how the conversation went and any feelings that came up for you?

User: Sure, that sounds good. Thank you for helping me think this through.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyu. You're doing great by taking these steps. I look forward to hearing how things go. Take care until our next session!

Consultant: Hi Xiaoyu, I'm really glad you've decided to come in today. How are you feeling right now?

User: I'm okay, I guess. I still don't really see the point of this. My mom just doesn't get me, and it's frustrating.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like feeling misunderstood and frustrated is weighing on you a lot. Could you tell me a bit more about what's been happening with your mom?

User: Well, whenever I try to talk to her about how I feel, she just criticizes me. Like if I say I'm stressed about school, she'll say I’m overreacting.

Consultant: That must feel pretty tough. It seems like you're really trying to communicate but it doesn't feel productive. Let's work on some skills that might help make these conversations more effective. How does that sound?

User: I guess it sounds okay, but I'm not really sure how it will help.

Consultant: Let's start by talking about using "I" statements. This means expressing how you feel and what you need without sounding like you’re blaming someone else. For example, instead of saying "You always criticize me," you could say "I feel upset when I hear criticism because I feel misunderstood."

User: So like, starting with "I feel" instead of "You always." That sounds a bit different, but maybe it could work.

Consultant: Exactly! It might help your mom understand your perspective better. Let's try to role-play a situation. How about you tell me something you want to express to your mom, and we'll figure out how to say it using "I" statements.

User: Okay, um... I guess I could say, "I feel upset when I don't get a chance to explain my side because it seems like I'm not being heard."

Consultant: That's a really good start, Xiaoyu. How do you feel about expressing it that way?

User: It feels a bit strange, but maybe it'd help her see how I really feel.

Consultant: It's natural for it to feel a bit different at first, but it can be very powerful. Let’s try another—what's something else you're dealing with that you could practice on?

User: Sometimes I feel really stressed before exams, and I want to say, "I need some support because the pressure makes me feel overwhelmed."

Consultant: That's very well expressed! Practicing this can help you get more comfortable when these situations arise with your mom.

User: Okay, I think I get it. It's like, I'm saying how I feel so she can understand better.

Consultant: Exactly. Over time, using these statements can improve the way communication happens between you and your mom. How has this shift in framing your thoughts and feelings felt?

User: It feels a bit more peaceful, like I'm not just angry and shouting. But I'm worried she still might not listen.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Change takes time, but you're building a strong foundation. Also, recognizing your mom's intentions could be key. Sometimes what sounds like criticism may come from a place of concern. How do you feel about that?

User: I guess I can try to see it that way, but it's really hard when it feels like she's never on my side.

Consultant: It can be difficult, but if we can find moments where her intentions are good, it might help ease the frustration. What do you think could make this easier for you?

User: Maybe if I reminded myself that she's trying to help in her own way, it might feel better.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiaoyu. Let’s explore more about how to give your mom feedback when things are working well too. This can reinforce positive communication between both of you as well.

User: So like, if she listens to me, I could say, "I really appreciate you listening because it makes me feel supported."

Consultant: Yes! That's an excellent approach. It encourages more of those supportive interactions. How do you feel about practicing this strategy?

User: It sounds like it could really help. I'll try to notice those moments and let her know.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we continue, reflect on the impact of these conversations on your relationship. How are you feeling about everything we’ve covered today?

User: I feel like I have some tools to try out now. It still worries me a bit, but it's something.

Consultant: I'm really proud of how open you've been in this session. You're taking important steps toward improving your relationship with your mom. As we move forward, remember we're here to navigate these challenges together.

User: Thanks. I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyu. I'm here to support you along the way. Would you like to set a specific intention or goal to focus on until our next session?

User: I think I’ll try the "I" statements when I talk to my mom and remind myself of her positive intentions as best as I can.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. We’ll explore how that goes the next time we meet. Thank you for being here and sharing your thoughts today.

User: Thank you for listening and helping me figure things out. 

Consultant: It's my pleasure. Take care, Xiaoyu, and remember you're doing a great job navigating these challenges. See you next time!

Consultant: Hi Xiaoyu, I'm glad you're here today. How have things been going since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've noticed some improvements in conversations with my mom. She's responded positively a few times, but I still feel quite sensitive to her criticisms. 

Consultant: That's good to hear about the improvements. It's natural to still feel sensitive at times. Can you tell me more about what your mom says that makes you feel this way?

User: Well, sometimes she points out the mistakes I make in my homework or how I manage my time. It feels like I can't do anything right.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It seems like those comments make you doubt yourself. What goes through your mind when she criticizes you?

User: I start thinking that maybe I'm not good enough, or that I'll never live up to her expectations. It makes me anxious and upset.

Consultant: I see how those thoughts could be distressing. Have you noticed if these thoughts impact your mood or how you react to other situations?

User: Yes, definitely. Sometimes I get headaches before exams or feel nervous even when I'm doing things I usually enjoy.

Consultant: Those physical symptoms seem to be connected to how you're feeling inside. Let's work on recognizing these thoughts and how they affect you. Can you give an example of a recent criticism and how it made you feel?

User: Last week, she said I was spending too much time on my hobbies instead of studying. I felt angry and frustrated because I thought I deserved some time to relax.

Consultant: It's important to find a balance between your responsibilities and relaxation. Let's consider if there might be a different way to look at her feedback. What else could it mean?

User: Maybe she just wants me to focus more on my studies and succeed, but sometimes it feels like I'm stuck only doing what she wants.

Consultant: That's a good perspective. It's possible her intentions are about helping you succeed. Have you thought about how you might respond in a way that acknowledges her concerns but also communicates your need for some personal space?

User: I guess I could try telling her that I understand her concerns but also need a bit of time for things I like. It's just hard to say it without sounding defensive.

Consultant: It's great you're thinking about how to communicate your needs. We can practice this conversation here. Would you like to give it a try?

User: Sure, I can try. I'd say something like, "Mom, I know studying is important, but having time for my hobbies helps me relax. Can we find a middle ground?"

Consultant: That's a polite and clear way to express your feelings and needs. How do you feel about trying this approach next time?

User: I think it might help. It feels like a better way to address it without making things worse.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel more comfortable with this approach. Let's also work on reinforcing your self-confidence when you receive criticism. How would you remind yourself of your strengths in those moments?

User: I could remind myself that I usually do well in tests and that I work hard on my assignments, even if sometimes it doesn't go perfectly.

Consultant: That's a great affirmation of your efforts and abilities. When you affirm these strengths, does it change how you view the criticism or how you feel about yourself?

User: Yes, it does. It makes me feel a little more secure and less upset by negative comments.

Consultant: Excellent. The more you practice these affirmations, the more you'll strengthen your self-confidence. How about setting a small, achievable goal for practicing this before our next session?

User: Maybe I could try to remind myself of one good thing I did each day, especially when I feel down about criticism. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal. It can help shift focus to positive achievements. Is there anything else you'd like to explore today?

User: I think I'm good for now. This conversation has already given me a lot to think about.

Consultant: Perfect, Xiaoyu. I'm glad we could talk through this, and I'm here whenever you need support. Keep practicing your self-affirmation and communication, and let me know how it goes.

User: Thank you, I will. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome. I'll see you in our next session, and you can always reach out if you need to discuss anything before then. Take care and remember, you're doing great!

User: Thanks, I'll try to remember that. Bye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiaoyu. Take care!

Consultant: Hi Xiaoyu! It's really nice to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident lately since my teacher praised me at school. But I still feel tied down by too much control from my parents. I wish I had more freedom to decide how I spend my study and rest time.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your confidence is growing. You mentioned feeling constrained by your parents' control. Can you tell me a bit more about when you feel this way the most?

User: Mostly when it comes to my study schedule. They always want me to stick to a strict routine, and sometimes it feels overwhelming. I get anxious if I think about all the rules I need to follow.

Consultant: I understand, Xiaoyu. It sounds like balancing their expectations with your need for independence is challenging. Let's explore some areas where you feel you might start gaining more control. What would you like to change first?

User: Maybe deciding when to take breaks or how long I study without them telling me what to do all the time.

Consultant: That's a good starting point. It may help to approach this by discussing with your parents. How do you feel about talking to them about having a bit more say in planning your study and break times?

User: It makes me a bit nervous, but I think it's important. I want them to understand that I can manage some things on my own.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. How about we practice what you might say to them? We can also explore how to handle the conversation if it doesn't go as expected.

User: Okay, maybe I can start by telling them how the praise at school made me realize I can be responsible. Then, I could ask for a chance to prove it with more control over my schedule.

Consultant: That sounds considerate and mature, Xiaoyu. Expressing how their trust could further boost your confidence might help them see the benefits. What about possible concerns they might raise? How would you address those?

User: They might say I'm not ready or won't use my time wisely. I could show them my plan for balancing study and breaks and promise to review it with them regularly.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach. It shows responsibility and willingness to keep them in the loop. How are you feeling about the idea of following through with this discussion?

User: A bit more hopeful now. I think it might work if I stay calm and explain myself clearly.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's okay to express your feelings throughout the talk. Acknowledge the effort you're making to take initiative. Should we go over any other scenarios or ideas?

User: Maybe how to respond if they insist on keeping things the same. I might get upset and don't want to argue.

Consultant: If that happens, staying calm and asking for a compromise could be helpful. Maybe propose a trial period where you try setting your schedule and then evaluate how it went together.

User: I like that idea. It might help to show them I can handle it. I should remember to breathe and stay composed.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiaoyu. Deep breaths can really help manage any frustration or anxiety. Over time, with practice and patience, they might start giving you more control. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: Encouraged, I guess. It seems like a fair way to show them I can be responsible.

Consultant: Wonderful. You're demonstrating such maturity and readiness to grow. Let's plan another session to follow up on how the conversation goes. It might also help to reflect on any adjustments you need. Sound good?

User: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Thank you for helping me find a way to make this work.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoyu. I'm excited to see how things unfold and am here to support you every step of the way. Remember, you’re doing a fantastic job of identifying and working towards what you need. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it.
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaoyu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling lately with all the changes happening?

User: Hi. Actually, I've been feeling quite good. I've picked up some new interests after school, and my friends have been really supportive.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaoyu! It sounds like you're creating a very positive environment for yourself. How do these new activities and support make you feel?

User: They make me feel more confident and happy. I don't worry as much about school as I used to.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling more confident. Do you notice any changes in how you handle school challenges, like homework or exams?

User: Yes, I've noticed I'm less anxious. I used to feel sick before exams, but now I just focus on doing my best.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement. Recognizing your efforts and achievements can help you maintain this positive mindset. Are there any strategies you've learned that help you stay calm?

User: I think taking deep breaths and talking to my friends about my worries help. They remind me that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Xiaoyu. It's important to remember those moments so you can use them in future situations. How do you plan to use these strategies for your upcoming exams?

User: I will try to breathe and maybe talk to my friends if I feel anxious again. I think it will help me focus.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Is there anything else that you find helpful in dealing with stress or anxiety?

User: Sometimes listening to music helps me relax. It distracts me from overthinking.

Consultant: Music can be very soothing. Keep finding those things that make you feel at ease. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel proud of myself. It's nice to know I can handle things better now.

Consultant: You should be proud, Xiaoyu. You've worked hard. How do your teachers and family see the changes in you?

User: They've noticed I'm more cheerful and less worried about schoolwork. It makes everything feel better.

Consultant: It's wonderful when others see the positive changes too. Is there anything you'd like to focus on more as you continue to grow and learn?

User: Maybe just keeping up with everything and not getting overwhelmed again.

Consultant: That's a wise goal. Keeping a balance is important. Do you remember the strategies we've discussed to stay balanced?

User: Yes, like taking breaks, organizing my work, and asking for help when needed.

Consultant: Exactly. Those will be key in maintaining your well-being. Are you confident in using these tools in the future?

User: Yes, I think I can use them.

Consultant: It's great to hear your confidence. What do you think has been the biggest lesson in all of this?

User: I learned that it's okay to feel worried sometimes, but I don't have to stay stuck in those feelings.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiaoyu. Recognizing that you have control is empowering. How about celebrating your achievements—any ideas on how you'd like to do that?

User: Maybe a small party with my friends. They’ve been really supportive.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect way to celebrate your progress and thank your friends. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

User: Not really, I just hope to keep growing like this.

Consultant: You've set a great foundation for yourself, Xiaoyu. Keep believing in your abilities, and remember I'm always here if you feel the need to talk in the future. Any final thoughts before we end this session?

User: Thank you for helping me. I feel ready to face whatever comes next.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyu. You've done remarkable work. Remember, you've got everything you need to handle things. Take care and enjoy your newfound confidence!
