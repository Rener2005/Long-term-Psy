Consultant: Hello, Xiaona! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to create a safe space for you to share anything that's on your mind. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down. There was this incident in my English class where I got into a physical conflict with a boy. It made me feel embarrassed and self-conscious about my looks. I just feel like people don't like me because of how I look.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaona. It's understandable to feel embarrassed after such an experience. It's also common to feel self-conscious about our looks, especially when we don't receive the validation we hope for from others. Can you tell me more about how this incident has affected your feelings about yourself?

User: I just keep thinking that if I looked better, maybe people would like me more. I feel so frustrated that I can't seem to make friends easily. It feels like no matter what I do, I don’t fit in.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration, and it's hurtful to feel like you're not fitting in. You mentioned thinking about your appearance as a barrier to connection. Can you share specific thoughts that come to your mind when you think about your looks and how they affect your interactions with others?

User: I always find myself comparing my appearance with others. I think they are prettier or more stylish than I am. Then I feel like I'm just this awkward person that no one wants to be around. It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: It’s understandable to compare yourself to others, especially during a time when social acceptance feels so important. Those thoughts can be really harsh and unkind. Let’s explore this further—what evidence do you have to support the belief that you’re less attractive or less likable than others?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It’s just how I feel. When I see popular girls, I think they are perfect, and I'm just... not.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaona. It seems like you’re holding onto some strong feelings, but you also recognize there’s no solid evidence to support them. Thinking about those popular girls, how do you think they might feel about themselves? Do you think they ever have insecurities or doubts?

User: Maybe? I suppose everyone has some things they struggle with. I just never really thought about that before; it feels like they’re so confident.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! Many people grapple with insecurities even if they seem confident on the outside. If you were in a situation where you were talking to someone who feels insecure about their looks, what comforting words or advice might you give them?

User: I think I would tell them that looks aren't everything and that it's what’s inside that counts. I might encourage them to focus on their strengths instead of their appearance.

Consultant: That's a very kind and nurturing approach, Xiaona. It's great to see you can give that support to others. Now, let’s try to apply this to yourself. What strengths or positive qualities do you see in yourself that you can focus on instead of your appearance?

User: Well, I’m pretty good at drawing. I like helping others when I can. I’ve also been trying to be a good listener in class.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities to recognize! Your talent in drawing and your kindness toward others are incredibly valuable. How do you think focusing on these strengths might help you feel more confident in your interactions with peers?

User: I guess if I focus on what I'm good at, I might feel less worried about how I look. Maybe I can also connect with others through drawing or by being a good friend.

Consultant: Absolutely! By embracing your strengths and talents, you can create connections that are deeper than appearance alone. Let’s think about some ways you can share your drawing talents with others—perhaps you can show your classmates your work or even organize a small drawing session together. How does that sound?

User: That sounds kind of fun! I’ve always loved sharing my drawings with friends, but I just stopped because I thought they wouldn’t be interested.

Consultant: It makes sense that you might hesitate to share, especially feeling the way you do right now. But this could be a great opportunity to reach out and form connections. What steps can we take to help you feel prepared to share your art with others?

User: Maybe I can start small, like sharing one drawing with a friend or just talking to someone about it. It feels less scary than showing the whole class.

Consultant: Starting small is a fantastic idea, Xiaona. It helps build your confidence without feeling overwhelmed. How about setting a specific goal for yourself this week to share a drawing with a friend and see how it feels?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll try to show one drawing before the week is over.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! I’m excited for you to take this step. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to reflect on what we’ve talked about. What insights or takeaways do you think will help you as you move forward?

User: I realized that my qualities matter more than my appearance and that I can use my drawing to connect with others. I just need to remind myself of that more often.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Xiaona! Focusing on your strengths can help shift your perspective. If you ever start to feel down about your looks again, remember this session and the qualities you carry. How confident do you feel about the steps you've outlined?

User: I do feel a bit more hopeful now. It’s not going to be easy, but I think I can handle it.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaona! Remember, building self-confidence takes time, and you’re already taking important steps. We can continue exploring these feelings in our next session. If you have any thoughts or feelings in between, know that I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaona! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaona! I'm really glad you're here today. Can you share with me how you've been feeling recently and what brought you to this session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit lost and confused about how I view myself. Lately, I've started noticing that I often think negatively about my appearance, especially when I'm talking to other classmates. It's hard to shake those feelings off.

Consultant: It sounds like these negative thoughts about your appearance are weighing heavily on you. You're saying it's especially difficult when interacting with others. Could you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to mind during those interactions?

User: I often think that they are judging me for how I look. I feel like I don't fit in, and it makes me anxious when I have to talk to them. I think they probably find me unattractive.

Consultant: I hear you. That feeling of being judged can be really overwhelming. When those thoughts come up, how does it make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel really nervous and sometimes embarrassed. It's like I freeze up and don't know what to say, which makes everything worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way in such situations. You mentioned freezing up—do you think those feelings also push you to avoid speaking up or engaging with others?

User: Yes, definitely. I just want to disappear sometimes because I feel so self-conscious. It’s hard to be in a group when I think everyone is looking at me.

Consultant: It sounds tough to feel like you want to hide from those social situations. Let’s explore those thoughts further. When you think "everyone is looking at me," can you recall any evidence that supports that thought? 

User: Not really, but I just assume that they do. I guess I think that everyone notices my flaws.

Consultant: It's common to make assumptions like that, especially when we're feeling insecure. What do you think could be some alternative explanations for why you might feel that way? 

User: Maybe they are just focused on their own things, and I’m just being too hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful perspective! It’s possible that people are preoccupied with their own concerns. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice do you think you would give them about these thoughts?

User: I would tell them not to worry so much and that others probably don’t notice their flaws as much as they think.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach you would take with a friend. Let’s practice treating yourself with that same kindness. What might change if you started believing that others are less focused on your flaws?

User: I might feel a little less anxious and might be able to talk more freely without worrying all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! Reducing that anxiety can open up more opportunities for you to connect with others. Let’s think of some small steps. What activities could you try that might help you practice socializing in a lower-stakes environment? 

User: Maybe I could start with talking to one close friend first and then gradually try to speak with more people.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can really make a difference and build your confidence over time. How would you feel about setting a goal for your next week regarding this?

User: I could aim to talk to a friend about something I like. Maybe we could discuss music or movies we enjoy.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Focusing on shared interests can make conversations more enjoyable and less stressful. Would you like to discuss any specific strategies to help you with that conversation?

User: I guess I could prepare some questions or topics in advance so I wouldn’t feel so lost in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Preparing in advance can help ease your anxiety during the conversation. What kind of questions do you think would be good to start with?

User: Maybe asking them about their favorite bands or what movies they’ve seen lately.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent open-ended questions! They’ll give your friend a chance to share, and you can build on their responses. Remember, it’s about creating a dialogue. How do you feel about trying this out next week?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I hope it goes well!

Consultant: That’s completely normal! It’s great that you’re feeling a mix of emotions. Remember, no matter how this conversation goes, it's a step forward in building your confidence. How do you plan to reflect on this experience afterward?

User: I think I’ll try to journal about how the conversation went and how I felt before and after. 

Consultant: Journaling is a wonderful way to reflect and process your feelings. It can help you understand your experiences better. As we near the end of this session, is there anything specific you’d like to summarize about what you’ve learned today?

User: I’ve learned that my thoughts about myself might not reflect reality. I can work on changing my mindset and practice socializing by talking to friends about things I enjoy.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Xiaona! You are already showing resilience by recognizing the need for a mindset shift. Keep focusing on those positive steps you've outlined. If you ever find yourself feeling overwhelmed or need a reminder of these strategies, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your help. I feel more hopeful about tackling this now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. You're doing a great job taking these steps for yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaona! I'm glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about building your confidence. I'm interested to know how you've been feeling since our last session.

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed. I realize I often doubt myself, especially around others. It's like a voice in my head keeps telling me I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like those doubts can really hold you back. Can you share a specific situation where you felt that way recently?

User: Well, last week at school, I was supposed to present a project in front of my class. I got really nervous and felt like I was going to mess it up. So, I just stayed quiet when it was my turn.

Consultant: That must have been really tough for you. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind just before your presentation?

User: I thought everyone would laugh at me if I said something wrong. It made me feel really anxious, and I ended up avoiding speaking at all.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious in front of others, especially with those kinds of thoughts. What do you think are the chances that people would have laughed at you if you had spoken?

User: I don’t know... Maybe they wouldn't have. But in that moment, it felt so real to me.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. Our minds can create very convincing thoughts. What if we tried to challenge that negative thought together? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they would laugh at you?

User: I guess... I’m not really sure. No one has laughed at me before, but I just felt like it was going to happen.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaona! It’s helpful to recognize that those thoughts might not be based on reality. Let’s explore a more balanced thought. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that people usually aren’t so harsh.

Consultant: Exactly! This is a more supportive perspective. How does thinking this way make you feel about your own presentation next time?

User: I think it might make me feel a bit less scared. Maybe I could actually try to speak.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Let’s focus on practicing some social skills together. How about we role-play a situation where you present to a small audience to build your confidence?

User: That sounds helpful. I feel a bit nervous about it, but I want to try.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is totally normal, and it shows that you care about doing well. I’ll be your audience and you can present something simple. Just take your time, and remember, it’s all about practice!

User: Okay, I’ll do my best! 

Consultant: Great! Whenever you’re ready, you can start your presentation.

User: Um… today I want to talk about my favorite hobby, which is drawing. I really enjoy it because it helps me express myself and relax.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful introduction, Xiaona! It's meaningful to share your passion. What do you like to draw most often?

User: I usually draw landscapes and sometimes people. I like capturing different feelings through my art.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to express your emotions! How does sharing your drawings with others make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit vulnerable, but also excited to see their reactions.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. Sharing your art is a brave thing to do! What if you were to share your drawings with friends or classmates? How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they might appreciate it. They usually seem to enjoy art.

Consultant: It sounds like you have supportive friends. What’s one small step you could take to share your art with them?

User: Maybe I could show them my sketches during lunch next week.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Let's make that your goal for next week. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: A little nervous but also excited. I want to see their reactions!

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Xiaona! It’s wonderful to feel excited about sharing. Remember, no matter the outcome, every experience is a chance to learn and grow. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind!

Consultant: As we wrap up for today, let’s reflect on your progress. You took a big step in challenging your thoughts and even practiced a presentation! What do you feel you’ve gained from today's session?

User: I think I’ve learned that my fears may not be as true as I think and that it’s okay to share my interests. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve done a great job recognizing those patterns. As you move forward, keep practicing those social skills. It’s a journey, but you're on the right path!

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated to try.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Xiaona! Remember, you can always come back if you need more support. I believe in your ability to grow and connect with others. See you next time!

User: See you! I'm looking forward to it!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaona! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit excited, actually. I tried talking to a few classmates during the class activities, and it felt good to have some positive feedback from them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step forward! It's wonderful to hear that you received positive feedback. What specific moments stood out to you during those interactions?

User: I remember one time when I suggested a game, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. They laughed and encouraged me, which made me feel happy.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like your suggestion was well-received, and it made you happy to see others enjoy it. How did that experience affect your feelings about socializing with your classmates?

User: It made me want to try to talk to them more. I guess I'm not as scared as I used to be, but I still feel a little anxious before I approach someone.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before social interactions, especially when you're making an effort to connect with others. What do you think helps you feel less scared in those moments?

User: I think knowing that I had a positive experience helps. It makes me feel like it's worth trying again.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Building on those positive experiences can really help reduce anxiety. What are some approaches you might use when you want to engage with your classmates again?

User: Maybe I could start with small chats about our classes or ask them about their hobbies. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with small chats is a perfect way to ease into conversations without too much pressure. Is there a specific class or activity where you'd like to practice this?

User: I think during lunch would be a good time. It's more relaxed then.

Consultant: Lunchtime sounds ideal! It’s a more casual environment. How about setting a small goal for yourself for the next lunch break? For example, initiating a conversation with at least one person.

User: I can try that! Just talking to one person seems manageable.

Consultant: I love that! Focusing on one conversation can make it feel less overwhelming. How will you feel if it goes well?

User: I’d feel really proud of myself. It would mean I’m getting better at this.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Celebrating each achievement, no matter how small, can really boost your confidence. What if it doesn’t go as planned? What thoughts might come up for you?

User: I worry I might feel embarrassed if they don’t respond positively.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let’s try to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that most interactions will go poorly, as opposed to the positive ones you've already experienced?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. Most of the time, people seem friendly.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, most people are open to conversations and appreciate when others make an effort. You could also think of what you'd say to a friend who had a similar fear of embarrassment.

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay, and even if it doesn’t go perfectly, it’s a learning experience.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to support a friend! Now, let’s use that same supportive voice for yourself. How can you be kinder to yourself if an interaction doesn’t go as you hoped?

User: I could remind myself that it's just one conversation and it's okay to learn from it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation! You’re on the right path. As we build on these practices, what are some other positive strategies you can think of that might help during these social situations?

User: Maybe I could practice some small talk topics before lunch so I feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparing some topics can give you the confidence to engage more easily. What are some potential small talk topics you could think of?

User: I could ask about weekend plans or what they're interested in, like movies or music.

Consultant: Great ideas! These are relatable topics that can encourage friendly conversations. How do you feel about trying this approach during lunch next time?

User: I feel excited about it! I hope it will go well.

Consultant: That enthusiasm is important! It indicates growth and readiness to engage. As we get closer to our next session, how can we ensure you feel prepared to tackle this lunch challenge?

User: Maybe I could set a reminder for myself to practice my small talk ideas.

Consultant: That’s a proactive strategy! Setting reminders can keep the ideas fresh in your mind. Remember, even if it doesn't go perfectly, each attempt is a step forward. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate that. I’ll do my best.

Consultant: You're doing wonderfully, Xiaona! Let’s continue to build on your confidence in these sessions. Before we conclude today, would you like to share what you feel is your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think realizing that it’s okay to practice, and even if it’s not perfect, I’m still learning is my biggest takeaway. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Remember, every effort is valuable. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Keep embracing those positive experiences, and I believe you’ll continue to feel more confident in social settings.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here to support you. Let’s keep working together to strengthen those social skills. See you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Na! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but sometimes I'm still unsure about how to communicate. I think I’ve learned some skills, but I wonder if I can really use them when it matters.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling a bit better! Let's focus on that uncertainty you mentioned. Can you share a specific situation where you felt unsure about using your skills?

User: Last weekend, at a friend's gathering, I tried to join conversations more, but I felt awkward. I was afraid I might say the wrong thing.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Engaging in conversations can truly feel overwhelming at times. What thoughts were going through your mind in that moment? 

User: I kept thinking that if I messed up, they might not want to talk to me again, and I just felt really nervous.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts made you feel anxious about the interaction. Let’s explore that belief—how likely do you think it is that making a mistake would lead to your friends not wanting to talk to you again?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. They are my friends, and they’ve never reacted that way before.

Consultant: That's a helpful realization! It seems like a more balanced thought could be that friends are supportive and understanding. What do you think would help you feel more relaxed during conversations, knowing your friends care about you?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes, it might help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the idea that mistakes are part of learning can really ease that pressure. Let’s practice some scenarios where you can use your skills without worrying too much. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds good, but I’m a little nervous to practice.

Consultant: That's completely normal, Xiao Na. Remember, the more we practice, the more comfortable you’ll become. Let's start with a simple role-play. Imagine you meet someone new at a gathering. What would you say to start a conversation?

User: I would say, "Hi, I’m Xiao Na. What do you like to do?"

Consultant: That's a great opening! Now, if the person responds positively, how would you keep the conversation going?

User: I could ask them more about their hobbies or interests, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Asking questions is a fantastic way to show interest and keep a dialogue flowing. Let’s practice that back and forth—I'll be the new person. 

User: Okay... Hi, I’m Xiao Na. What do you like to do?

Consultant: Hi, Xiao Na! I enjoy painting and reading. What about you? 

User: I like... um, talking with friends and sometimes drawing.

Consultant: That’s perfect! You’re doing well. Now, if I said I also enjoy drawing, what could you say next?

User: I could ask what kind of things you like to draw?

Consultant: Yes! That keeps the conversation going and shows your interest. How do you feel after trying that out?

User: A bit less nervous, actually. It helps to think of questions in advance.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having questions ready can ease the pressure. Let's address any future situations where you might feel anxious. Can you think of a potential social scenario that might come up soon?

User: There’s another gathering next weekend. I’m worried I might freeze up again.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Since you've practiced some questions today, why don’t we identify two or three that you can remember to use next weekend? 

User: I could say, "What do you like to do for fun?" and "Have you seen any good movies lately?"

Consultant: Excellent choices! Having those in mind can give you a sense of control. What might help you stay calm if you start to feel nervous at the gathering?

User: Maybe taking deep breaths or just reminding myself I can ask my questions.

Consultant: Those are great strategies, Xiao Na. Remember, it’s perfectly fine to take a moment for yourself. You’re developing those social skills wonderfully! How are you feeling about your progress today?

User: I feel more confident about trying at the gathering. I think I can do this.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You’ve made great strides in your confidence and skills. For our next session, let’s touch on how the gathering went and any experiences you want to reflect on. 

User: Okay! I’ll definitely share everything with you.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it! Remember, be kind to yourself during this learning process. You’re doing incredibly well, and I’m here to support you. Let’s wrap up for today.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Na! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaona! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, I think. I've been enjoying my time with my classmates more now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like you're beginning to appreciate your social interactions more. What moments or experiences have stood out to you lately?

User: Well, I've been laughing more during breaks and feeling like I belong. But sometimes, I still feel a bit anxious around new people.

Consultant: It's normal to feel a bit anxious in new situations, especially when social dynamics are involved. Let's explore that a bit. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel anxious in those situations?

User: I worry that they won't like me, or that I'll say something stupid. It makes me want to avoid talking.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It sounds like you're concerned about others' perceptions. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel nervous and sometimes a bit sad, like I just want to go back to my room and hide.

Consultant: I understand. It must be tough to deal with those feelings. Let's take a moment to recognize that you've been making progress in your social interactions. Remember, it’s okay to have mixed feelings. Can we think of a time when you've successfully interacted with someone new? What helped you during that moment?

User: Yes! There was this new girl in my class, and I just started chatting with her about our classes. It felt good, and we laughed a lot!

Consultant: That sounds like a great experience! It shows that you have the ability to connect with others. How did you feel during that conversation?

User: I felt happy and relaxed—much different from how I usually feel!

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems you have the potential to feel comfortable in conversations. Let's think about how to challenge those negative thoughts you mentioned. What evidence do you have that people won't like you?

User: Well, it's just a feeling… I don't have any actual proof that they don't like me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often the case that feelings can be misleading. If a friend were in your position, what might you advise them to think instead?

User: I would tell them it doesn’t matter what others think; what’s more important is being themselves.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Embracing authenticity can really help ease anxiety. Based on that, what new thought could you replace the negative ones with when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could say, "It's okay to just be myself, and if they don't like me, that's not the end of the world."

Consultant: Yes, that’s a powerful reframe! Let's practice holding on to that thought. The next time you feel anxious, remind yourself of your worth and the joy of connection. How does that sound?

User: It sounds helpful. I think I can try that!

Consultant: Great! Let's also think about your overall progress. What strategies have you found effective in maintaining your self-confidence during these social interactions?

User: I’ve been trying to focus on my interests and talk about things I like. It helps me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Focusing on your interests can certainly make conversations more enjoyable. Moving forwards, how would you like to keep building on this confidence?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to talk to new classmates more often. Like one new person each week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting achievable goals can help reinforce your confidence. What do you think might help you stick to this goal?

User: I could keep a journal to track my conversations and feelings about them.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable tool! Writing can help you reflect and see your progress. How do you feel about the idea of checking in on your goals at our next session?

User: It feels encouraging. I think I’d like to see how I’m doing.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to that! We can review your experiences and celebrate your achievements together. Before we wrap up today, is there anything specific you’d like to address or questions you have?

User: No, I think I'm good. I feel more positive after talking.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, embracing your growth is important. You've made notable strides, and I'll be here to support your journey. Next time, we’ll reflect on your progress and see what further support we can plan. Have a great week ahead, Xiaona!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it!
