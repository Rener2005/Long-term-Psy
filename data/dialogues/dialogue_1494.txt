Consultant: Hello, Shi Shi! It's good to see you today. I’m here to listen and support you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really lost and sad. After the argument with my mom about my grades, I don’t know how to cope. I ended up hurting myself again, and now I just feel even more ashamed and confused.

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of difficult emotions right now. It's understandable to feel this way, especially with the pressure you’re under. Can you tell me more about what led up to that argument and how it made you feel?

User: Well, my mom was upset because my grades dropped. She yelled a lot, and I just felt really overwhelmed. I used to dance a lot, and I miss it, but she always puts so much pressure on me about school. 

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of tension around your schoolwork and your mother’s expectations. You mentioned missing dancing; can you share how that impact your feelings and how you wish things were different?

User: Dancing used to make me feel free, but now I can’t do it anymore. I feel like my mom doesn’t understand how much it means to me. It’s like my dreams are taken away from me.

Consultant: I can sense how much dancing meant to you, and it's painful when something you love feels out of reach. Can I ask, when you hurt yourself, what feelings are you trying to manage during those moments?

User: It’s like the emotional pain is so overwhelming that the physical one becomes a distraction. It feels like I can release some of the pressure, even if it’s just for a little while.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Sometimes, physical pain can feel more manageable than emotional pain. But I want to help you find safer ways to express and cope with those feelings. Have you thought about some other ways to release this pressure or express what you’re feeling?

User: I haven’t really thought of anything else. It just feels hard to reach out or talk about it. Plus, I don’t know if anyone would understand.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel hesitant about talking. Let’s explore that. What if we brainstorm some safe ways for you to express your feelings without resorting to self-harm? We could think about journaling, art, or even movement like dancing in a way that feels right for you.

User: I used to love writing poems, but I haven’t done that in a long time. Maybe I could try that again?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Writing can be a very powerful way to process emotions. What would it feel like to start writing again? Do you have any themes or topics in mind?

User: I think I’d want to write about how it feels to be stuck and sad but still longing for dance. Just the contrast of emotions.

Consultant: That’s a powerful theme. Writing about those feelings could help you explore and understand them more. Also, how do you feel about taking small steps towards dancing again, even if it’s just at home?

User: I’d love that, but I’m scared my mom would get upset again if she sees my grades drop more.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be concerned about your mom's reaction. Perhaps we can approach that together. What if we think of a way to communicate your desire to dance with her? You could start by expressing how much it means to you while assuring her that you are still committed to improving your grades.

User: I guess I could try to talk to her. It’s just scary to open up like that.

Consultant: It’s quite brave to consider sharing your feelings. We could practice how to approach that conversation. What do you think you would want to say to her first?

User: I might say that I miss dancing and it helps me feel better. But then I worry she’ll focus too much on the grades.

Consultant: You can certainly express how dancing helps you emotionally and can actually motivate you in school. Perhaps you could say something like, “Mom, dancing makes me feel happier and helps me focus better on my studies.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good, but I still worry about how she would react. What if she just gets angry again?

Consultant: It’s normal to have those concerns. Remember, you can control your message but not her response. If she reacts negatively, how could you cope with that emotion in a healthy way?

User: I could write about it or talk to my grandma. She understands me better.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Having a support system can help you manage those feelings when things get tough. It’s important to reach out to those who understand and uplift you. 

User: I feel a little better thinking about having a plan and a way to express myself.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Shi Shi! It’s important to have both a plan for communication and healthy coping mechanisms. How about we set some goals for the next week? Maybe you can try writing and dancing a bit, and see how that feels?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ll try to write a poem and dance a little at home.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! And remember, it's okay if it doesn’t turn out perfect. The important part is that you’re taking steps to explore your emotions and connect with yourself. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re doing really well, and it’s wonderful to see your willingness to explore these feelings. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, it's okay to reach out in between our sessions if you need to talk. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll try to keep you updated.

Consultant: Great! Just know that you’re not alone in this journey. I’m here for you. Let’s continue working together to help you find your voice and express your emotions safely. 

User: Thank you so much. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Shi Shi! I'm really glad to see you today. I understand you've been going through some tough emotions lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I just feel like my passion for dance has been taken away from me. I tried writing an essay about it to express my feelings, but my mom just criticized me for not focusing on my studies. It’s like she doesn’t understand how much dance means to me.

Consultant: I hear you, Shi Shi. It must be really painful to feel that your passion is being dismissed, especially when you've tried to express that through writing. What does dancing mean to you, and how do you feel when you think about it?

User: Dancing used to make me really happy. It was my escape, and I felt free when I danced. But now, I just feel stuck and sad. I want to dance again, but my confidence is so low because of the pressure I feel from my mom.

Consultant: It sounds like dancing was a vital part of your happiness, and now it's causing you a lot of distress. What do you think would help you regain that connection with dance, despite the challenges from your mom?

User: I guess I just want her to understand that it’s important to me, but I'm not sure how to make her see it. I feel like everything I am going through is just a burden to her.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling like you’re burdening someone you care about. It seems like you're seeking support and understanding from your mom. Do you think there are ways you could communicate your passion for dance to her that might help her see its importance to you?

User: Maybe if I could show her how it helps me feel better and be happier… But I don’t know how to start that conversation. I don’t want her to get angry.

Consultant: Starting that conversation can definitely feel intimidating, especially if you're worried about her reaction. What if we brainstormed together a few points you could present? Perhaps explaining how dance aids in your emotional well-being might be helpful. How does that sound to you?

User: That could be good. I just wish she would listen instead of getting upset right away.

Consultant: It’s understandable to wish for understanding before jumping to reactions. Let’s think about how you could frame your feelings and needs in a way that encourages dialogue rather than defensiveness. Could you perhaps emphasize your feelings first, instead of how she might see it?

User: Like saying I feel sad without dance? 

Consultant: Exactly! Starting with “I feel sad” lets her know how this impacts you on a personal level. It’s a way to express your emotions without putting her on the spot. What do you think her likely responses might be when you express it like this?

User: I really hope she would try to understand. But I worry she might still dismiss it as just me being lazy.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Shi Shi. Would it be helpful to prepare for that by considering how you might respond if she reacts that way? Perhaps sharing a specific experience when dancing helped you cope with stress could illustrate your point?

User: Yes, I can think of a moment when I danced instead of crying after a fight with my friends. It really helped me feel much better. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! Sharing personal experiences can make your feelings more relatable. How would you feel about using that story during your conversation with her?

User: I think it might help. I just hope she listens and doesn’t get angry. 

Consultant: You sound hopeful about the possibility, which is great! Keep in mind it's normal to feel anxious about opening up. What if we also explored some other healthy outlets for expressing your passion for dance, even if your mom might not fully agree right away?

User: I guess I could practice on my own at home. But I still miss being in a class.

Consultant: Practicing at home sounds like a fantastic first step! It allows you to reconnect with your passion in a safe space. What about joining an online class or video tutorials? That way, you can still learn and dance while feeling empowered.

User: That sounds interesting! I’ve seen some dance tutorials online. I could try that.

Consultant: That’s a promising idea! It lets you explore dance on your terms. Plus, it might give you some enthusiasm to share with your mom later on. How do you feel about combining that with the conversation we discussed earlier?

User: Combining them could be great! If I can show her I’m still engaging with dance, she might be more understanding.

Consultant: Absolutely! Showing her your active engagement can provide more context for your feelings. Remember, your passion is valid, and you deserve to express it healthily. 

User: Thanks, I needed that reassurance. It’s just hard to see things clearly sometimes.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Shi Shi. Remember, reaching out for help is a step toward clarity. How do you feel about the plan we’ve created together?

User: I feel a bit better! I see a way forward, and it gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You have the strength to navigate this. Let’s keep building on this progress. How about we check in on how the conversation and your practice go in our next session? 

User: Yes, definitely! I’ll work on that conversation and let you know how it goes.

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing about it. Just remember, it's okay to take small steps, and you’re not alone in this. You can always reach out if you need help in between. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Shi Shi. Keep nurturing your passion for dance and remember to be kind to yourself. Until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Poem! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better because I talked to my teacher. She really understood my situation and said I could explore more activities that I enjoy.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you found support from your teacher. Can you tell me more about what activities you're interested in exploring?

User: I really miss dancing. I used to love it, but my mom got upset when my grades slipped. Now, I'm scared of her reaction if I bring it up again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially given how your mom has responded in the past. What would it look like for you to approach her about dancing again?

User: I imagine telling her how much I love dancing and how it makes me feel better. But I worry she’ll just focus on my grades again.

Consultant: It sounds like you want to express your feelings, but you're concerned about her reaction. What if we practiced how you could communicate this to her? 

User: That might help. I just don’t know how to start without her getting defensive.

Consultant: Let's break it down, then. You might start by expressing your feelings first. For example, you could say, “Mom, I wanted to share something important with you. Dancing makes me feel happy.” What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds like a good start! I could try that.

Consultant: Great! After that, you could explain how it helps you manage stress and maybe even mention that it could improve your mood. How does that feel to you?

User: I like the idea of mentioning my mood. It may help her understand that it is good for me, but I'm still afraid.

Consultant: That fear is completely valid. If you were to practice this conversation in a safe environment, it might make it easier when you actually talk to her. Want to give it a try now?

User: OK, I’ll try! “Mom, I wanted to share something important with you. Dancing makes me feel happy.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! How would you continue from there?

User: I could say, “It helps me manage stress and makes my mood better.” 

Consultant: Yes, perfect! Now, what would you say if she responds negatively or brings up your grades?

User: I guess I could say, “I understand school is important, but I believe dancing could actually help me improve my grades because I’d feel better.”

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re connecting your passion for dancing with a positive outcome for her concern about your grades. That might just help lower her defenses. 

User: I hope so! It sounds logical. 

Consultant: Logic is a great tool when communicating! How are you feeling about this conversation now compared to when we started?

User: I feel more confident. Talking about it helps me come up with a plan.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful progress, Poem! Remember, communication is about sharing your needs and emotions openly. It sounds like you've already been practicing that with your teacher. 

User: Yes, and it felt so relieving! 

Consultant: That’s a key experience to build upon. Now, in addition to approaching your mom about dance, are there other ways you’d like to gain support for your interests?

User: I think I could reach out to my classmates. Maybe some of them would be interested in dancing, too.

Consultant: What a fantastic idea! Social connections can really help. How would you go about inviting them to join you?

User: Maybe I could ask if anyone wants to dance together after school. 

Consultant: That’s a great way to create a supportive community! And if someone says yes, how do you think that would make you feel?

User: I’d feel really happy. It would make dancing feel less lonely, and I’d have people to share it with. 

Consultant: That joy can be so uplifting! You deserve that, Poem. Can you see how this could also help with your confidence in other areas?

User: Yes, I think it might help me feel more confident around my mom too!

Consultant: Absolutely! Building connections and pursuing your interests can enhance your overall well-being. Remember, it's about gradual steps. How do you feel now about engaging with your mom and your classmates about dancing?

User: I feel more resolved to do it! I think I can also express my feelings better.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've achieved. How do you think you'll maintain this positive mindset as you move forward?

User: I’ll remind myself of these talks and my plans. I’ll also try to keep practicing what I’ll say to my mom and friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like an effective plan! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. I'm confident that you’ll manage it well. If you ever need support, you know I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel really supported and understood today. 

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Poem! I'm really proud of the steps you're taking. Until next time, take care of yourself and keep nurturing your interests!

Consultant: Hello, Shishi! I'm glad to see you again. It's great to hear you’re feeling a bit more confident after getting back into dance. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, actually. Dancing again has made me happy—for a moment, I felt like I was myself again. But I still get really scared when my mom talks to me about my grades. 

Consultant: It sounds like dance has helped lift your spirits, which is wonderful! But I can see that your mom's reactions still weigh heavily on you. Could you tell me more about what happens when she brings up your grades?

User: Whenever she talks about my grades, she gets really angry. It feels like she’s never satisfied, and sometimes she even raises her voice. I just freeze up and can't respond. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Shishi. It's understandable to feel frightened in those situations. How does her anger make you feel about your own abilities or your self-worth?

User: It makes me feel really bad about myself. Like, no matter how hard I try, it's never enough. I just want her to be proud of me, and I hate disappointing her.

Consultant: Wanting to make your mom proud is a natural feeling. It's painful to feel like you’re not meeting her expectations. Let's explore that a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind during those moments when you're feeling disappointed or scared?

User: I just think that if I don’t get good grades, then I’m a failure. And then I wonder if she’ll still love me or if I’ll just disappoint her even more. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. It’s important to challenge these ideas a little. Do you think it’s true that your worth as a person depends solely on your grades?

User: I guess not, but it definitely feels that way when she’s upset. 

Consultant: That’s a valid point, Shishi. Let's try to reframe that thinking. What if you considered your value is based on who you are as a person, and not just your grades? What qualities do you value in yourself?

User: I guess I’m creative and I really love dancing. I can make people laugh sometimes too.

Consultant: Those are fantastic qualities! It sounds like you bring joy and creativity into the world. Remembering these can help when you're struggling with academic pressures. How might you remind yourself of these strengths when your mom brings up your grades?

User: Maybe I could write them down somewhere. Or even tell myself them when I feel scared. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Positive self-talk can be very powerful. You deserve to see yourself beyond just grades. As for your mom's reactions, how do you think you might approach those conversations differently moving forward?

User: Maybe I could try to stay calm and remind myself that her anger isn’t about me as a person. But it’s hard to do that in the moment.

Consultant: It's definitely not easy, but acknowledging that her feelings don’t define you is a step in the right direction. It might also help to express how you feel to her when it’s calm. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: I’m not sure. I haven’t really talked to her about how her words affect me before. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel hesitant. Perhaps starting with small steps could make it less intimidating. You could try sharing your feelings in a letter or during a quiet moment. What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds a bit easier. Writing a letter might give me more time to think about what I want to say.

Consultant: Exactly! Writing can provide clarity and help you communicate your feelings without being overwhelmed. How do you feel about incorporating this into your next week?

User: I think I could give it a try. I just hope she reacts well. 

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about her response, but remember that you’re expressing your needs and feelings, which is important. Even if her reaction isn’t what you hope, you’re taking a brave step. Do you feel ready to move forward with this plan?

User: Yes, I think so. It seems like a good way to express myself without feeling overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, Shishi! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. It’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s meet again next week to talk about how it went and continue building on the strategies we discussed today. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling a little more hopeful about talking to her. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You're doing such important work on yourself. I look forward to hearing all about it next time. Take care, Shishi!

Consultant: Hello, Shi Shi! It's great to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your recent progress in dance class?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually! That feedback I got from the online dance group was amazing. It made me feel accomplished, like I’m getting better at something.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling a sense of achievement can be very empowering. How has this positive experience affected your daily life or interactions with others?

User: I feel like I can open up more. It's nice to know that there are people who appreciate what I do. Sometimes, I still think about everything else, but this makes me a bit happier.

Consultant: It sounds like sharing your dance progress has helped boost your confidence and happiness. Are there ways you’d like to continue connecting with others who share your passion for dance?

User: I think I want to share more about my experiences, maybe even perform a little. But sometimes, I get worried about what people might think.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about how others might perceive you. What do you think would help ease those worries as you consider sharing your passion with others?

User: Maybe if I practice more first, it could help me feel more prepared. But I also worry about not being as good as others.

Consultant: Preparing can definitely help you feel more confident. Do you find that these thoughts of comparison come up often, especially in situations where you’re putting yourself out there?

User: Yes, they do. I often think, "What if I mess up?" Or "What if they think I’m not good enough?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. Let’s explore them a bit. If a friend came to you with similar feelings of doubt, how would you encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has to start somewhere and that practice makes perfect. But then again, it’s harder to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful response. It shows you are supportive of your friends, yet it seems challenging to extend that same kindness to yourself. What if we try to challenge those doubts? What evidence do you have that supports the idea of not being good enough?

User: I guess I really don’t have solid evidence. It's just a feeling I get, especially when I think about those dance videos online.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings might be more about comparison rather than true reflection of your abilities. How were you able to not feel this way when receiving positive feedback from others recently?

User: When I got that feedback, I felt proud of myself. Maybe I could try to focus more on those positive moments rather than comparing myself to others.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on your achievements can help build a stronger foundation for confidence. What steps do you think you could take to reinforce that positive feeling as you move forward?

User: I could keep a journal of my progress and the positive feedback I receive. It might help me remember those moments when I feel down.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can be a source of encouragement when self-doubt creeps in. Are there other activities you enjoy that you could incorporate into your routine to foster those positive feelings?

User: I could definitely dance more often or even just listen to music that makes me feel good. I sometimes forget I can do that.

Consultant: Incorporating more dance and music sounds like a great way to lift your spirits and stay connected to your passion. As you explore these activities, how do you think they'll impact your interactions with others?

User: I think it might help me be more social. If I talk about what I love, maybe I’ll connect with more people who share the same interests.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your passion for dance can open up great opportunities for connection. As we wrap up today, what feelings do you take away from our conversation that you’d like to hold onto moving forward?

User: I feel more motivated to dance and share my experiences, instead of hiding away. I also feel understood, which is nice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Shi Shi. Holding onto that motivation and sense of understanding is key. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. What’s one action you could take this week to start sharing your love for dance with others?

User: I could post a short dance video online, just to see what my friends think. I know it’ll be a little scary, but I want to try!

Consultant: That’s a brave step! I’m excited to hear how it goes. Remember, focus on enjoying the process, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time! You’re doing great. 

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Shi Shi. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Shishi! I'm so glad to see you again today. You mentioned in our last session that you felt more understood and supported by your mother. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I feel a bit lighter, actually. I had a good conversation with my mother about my dance classes, and she seems to be more open to understanding my passion now. It's nice to feel supported.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great that you could have that conversation. How are you feeling about your dance classes and the support from your mother now?

User: I'm feeling more positive about it. I really miss dancing, and knowing that she wants to help means a lot to me. It makes me want to pursue it again, even with my studies.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're feeling more hopeful about pursuing dance again. Balancing your studies and your passion can be challenging. What do you think will help you maintain that balance?

User: I think if I can manage my time better and stay organized, I can fit both into my life. I just need to be careful not to let my studies slip again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Managing your time effectively is key. What are some steps you could take to start implementing this plan?

User: I could create a schedule that includes both study times and dance practice. Maybe I can even find some online resources to help me study more efficiently.

Consultant: Creating a schedule can really help you see your commitments clearly. It's also great that you're considering online resources. How do you feel about trying out this new approach?

User: I feel excited, but also a bit nervous. What if I can't stick to it or if my grades drop again? 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about change. What evidence do you have that you won’t be able to stick to this plan? Sometimes our fears can exaggerate the situation. 

User: Well, I did struggle a lot in the past with focusing on my studies, so I worry that it might happen again, especially with distractions. 

Consultant: I understand that concern. Let's try to challenge that thought—what if, instead of focusing on the distractions, we look at the strategies that have worked for you in the past? 

User: I guess I had success when I set small goals and took breaks. Those helped my mind stay clear. 

Consultant: Exactly! Perhaps you can incorporate small goals into your schedule? This wouldn't only keep you on track academically, but also allow you time to enjoy dance and relax. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to break my study sessions into smaller chunks. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Additionally, since you’ve shown progress with your feelings toward your mother and dance, how do you think you can maintain this positive support system?

User: I think just talking to her more and keeping her updated on how I'm doing with my studies and dance could help. It felt good to share my thoughts with her.

Consultant: Communication is essential! It builds the understanding you’ve been working on. If you face challenges, would you feel comfortable reaching out to her for support?

User: Yes, I think I could do that, especially if things get tough again. I don't want to fall back into negative habits. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you want to prevent reverting to old habits. If you feel overwhelmed, what other coping strategies might you consider instead of self-harm? 

User: I could try journaling or drawing. Those helped me before. I'd like to avoid using harmful methods for my emotions. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Journaling can be especially useful for expressing feelings without acting on impulse. How do you feel about incorporating this into your routine?

User: I think I can manage that. Writing and drawing would be a good way to release my feelings and reflect on my progress. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s so important to have healthy outlets. As we continue this journey, let’s summarize your progress today. You’ve opened up communication with your mother, feel motivated to dance again, and identified positive coping strategies. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds great! I feel like we’ve covered a lot today, and I have a better outlook on my situation now.

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that, Shishi! For our next steps, I suggest we keep monitoring your progress with the schedule and coping strategies. How do you feel about scheduling our next session to check in on all of this?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to keep discussing how it’s going. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic. Remember, it’s okay to seek support when you need it. You’re building great skills, and I’m here for you. If anything comes up before our next session, you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and advice. 

Consultant: You’re doing an incredible job, Shishi! I believe in your ability to maintain this positive path. It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Until next time! 

User: Until next time!
