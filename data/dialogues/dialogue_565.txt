Consultant: Hello Roberto! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about your time in class lately?

User: Hi. I feel kind of frustrated because my teacher keeps telling me to sit quietly, and I don’t think I’m being understood. It makes me not want to participate anymore.

Consultant: I understand how that can feel frustrating. It seems you feel misunderstood and this is affecting your willingness to join in class activities. Can you tell me more about those moments when you get called out by your teacher?

User: Sometimes I just wiggle in my seat or talk a little, and then my teacher says I’m being too loud or not paying attention. It hurts because I feel like I'm trying my best.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you’re trying hard but still not being recognized for it. What kind of things are going through your mind when your teacher addresses you like that?

User: I think that maybe I’m just not good at sitting still, and it makes me feel like I’m a problem in class.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but it’s important to remember that everyone has different strengths. Let’s explore how you can feel more comfortable managing your behavior in class. What would it look like for you to be more recognized by your teacher?

User: I guess if I could sit quietly for a while and focus, they would notice and maybe say something nice.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! If we can find ways to help you stay calm and focused, it might lead to more positive feedback from your teacher. Are there specific strategies you think might help you stay quiet and concentrate?

User: Maybe if I sit in a different spot or have something to fidget with, it could help me stay still.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Changing your seat can help minimize distractions. Fidgeting with something can also keep your hands busy while you concentrate. How do you feel about trying those strategies in the classroom?

User: I think I would like to try that. It might help me be quieter.

Consultant: Excellent! It’s all about finding what works for you. Let’s come up with a plan together. How about you try sitting in a new spot next time and keeping a fidget toy with you? We can check back in on how that goes.

User: That sounds good. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Fantastic! Trying it out is the first step. As you begin this, how do you think you might remind yourself to use these strategies during class?

User: Maybe I can tell myself to focus on the lesson and that it’s okay to fidget as long as I’m quiet.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach, Roberto. Reminding yourself can help keep you on track. As you practice these strategies, how might you feel if your teacher notices your efforts to stay quiet?

User: I hope it makes me feel proud. I really want to hear my teacher say something nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful hope! Feeling proud of your efforts is really important. We can even think of some specific phrases your teacher might say if they notice your improvements. What do you think those could be?

User: Maybe they could say I’m doing a good job focusing or that they’re happy with my behavior.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Imagining those positive comments can be motivating. As you try these new strategies, how can you celebrate even the small successes you have in class?

User: I guess I could share with my parents if I feel I did well, and maybe I could reward myself with some extra playtime.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Sharing your successes and rewarding yourself will help reinforce those positive changes. How do you feel about trying out these strategies next week?

User: I feel excited about it! I want to see if it works. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. We can meet again to talk about how it went. You’re doing great by being willing to make some changes. 

User: Thank you! It feels nice to have a plan. I’ll do my best. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Roberto! You’re showing a lot of courage in working through this. I look forward to hearing all about your experience next time. Keep believing in yourself! 

User: I will! Thank you for helping me feel better. 

Consultant: Anytime! It’s my pleasure to support you. Remember to practice those strategies and be kind to yourself. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Roberto! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your behavior in class since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing okay. I managed to sit quietly in class a few times, but sometimes I still want to talk to Marcus, and that makes it hard.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been able to sit quietly! It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with wanting to talk to Marcus. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Yeah, sometimes it just feels natural to talk to him, especially when we have fun together. But I know I need to focus on my work.

Consultant: It makes sense that you want to chat with your friend. Friendships are important and can be fun! However, it sounds like you're trying to balance that with staying focused on your schoolwork. How do you feel when you successfully stay quiet during class?

User: I feel a bit proud, actually! The teacher even praised me once for being quiet and paying attention. That felt nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement, Roberto! Receiving praise from your teacher can really boost your confidence. What do you think it was about that moment that made you feel proud?

User: I think it was because I finally followed through with my plan. I didn’t think I could do it at first.

Consultant: Following through with your plan is definitely something to feel proud of! It shows you are capable of making changes. How do you think you can maintain this focus in the future while managing your desire to talk to Marcus?

User: Maybe I can sit farther away from him or focus on something else when I feel the urge to talk.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! Distancing yourself when you feel that urge is a good way to maintain your focus. How does the thought of applying that idea make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit less worried about it, actually. Like, I can control it if I try.

Consultant: That’s a positive attitude, Roberto! Recognizing that you can control your behavior is important. Let’s talk about how to track your successes. How would you feel about keeping a small notebook to mark the days you stay quiet in class?

User: I think that could help me see how well I’m doing. I’d like that!

Consultant: Excellent! Having a visual reminder of your successes can reinforce your efforts. You can also note how it feels when your teacher praises you. What kind of feelings do you think you might write down after a successful day?

User: I could write that I feel happy and proud. Maybe even excited!

Consultant: Those are fantastic feelings to capture! They reinforce the positive behaviors you are developing. Let’s think about when you might feel less sure of yourself—what would help you remind yourself of your progress in those moments?

User: Maybe I could look at the notes I've written about my successes. That might remind me I can do it!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Reflecting on your successes can be a powerful motivator. If you start feeling pressure or challenges, how can you reassure yourself?

User: I can remind myself that I’m getting better at this, and my teacher thinks I’m doing well.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping those reminders central in your mind can help build your self-confidence. As we move forward, how does it feel to think about using these strategies and celebrating your progress?

User: It feels good! I think I can do this. I just have to keep trying.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Roberto! Commitment to trying is key. Remember, it’s okay to experience challenges along the way; they are just a part of learning. After our session, what is the first thing you think you will do to prepare to implement these strategies?

User: I’ll write down my plan in my notebook and maybe even bring it to class tomorrow!

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By taking that action, you are setting yourself up for success. I’m here to support you, and I believe you can do this. Do you feel ready to embrace these changes?

User: Yes, I really do! I’m excited to see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too, Roberto! Let’s keep building on your progress together. Make sure to share your experiences next time we meet. Remember, each small step is a victory toward being your best self.

User: Thank you! I will share my notes and my experiences for sure.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing all about it. You've done exceptionally well today, Roberto. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities. If you ever need to talk or feel unsure, I'm just a session away.

User: Thanks so much! I feel better about everything now.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Keep up the good work, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello Roberto! I'm really glad to see you today. Let’s talk about how you’ve been feeling in school and any challenges you faced while trying to stay focused.

User: Hi! I’ve been working hard to stay focused in class, and my teacher said I did a good job last week. But sometimes, I still have trouble staying quiet and paying attention.

Consultant: That's great to hear your teacher's feedback! It sounds like you’ve made some progress, which is really encouraging. Can you share with me what you've been doing to help yourself stay focused?

User: I try to remind myself to pay attention and follow the lesson. But when I think about all the things I need to do, I get a bit overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort, which is commendable. When you feel overwhelmed, what kind of thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I often think, “What if I can’t keep this up?” or “What if I miss something important?” It just makes me more anxious.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about missing important things in class. Let’s take a moment to look at those thoughts. How true do you think those thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports or challenges them?

User: Well, I’ve managed to keep up in my classes so far. My teacher said I’m doing well, so maybe it’s not as bad as I think.

Consultant: That’s a really valuable realization, Roberto! It’s good to remind yourself of the successes you’ve had. If a friend was feeling the way you do, what would you say to help them?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry and that they’re doing their best. Maybe even suggest they focus on one thing at a time.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on one thing at a time can help reduce that overwhelming feeling. In terms of strategies, what do you think you could do to concentrate better, especially on tasks that seem difficult?

User: Maybe I could break my work into smaller parts and take short breaks to make it easier.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Breaking tasks down and rewarding yourself with breaks can keep you motivated. How might you set up those smaller tasks in a way that feels manageable?

User: I could make a list of what I need to do and check them off as I go along. That would help me see my progress.

Consultant: I love that idea! Having a checklist can provide you with clear goals and a sense of accomplishment. Do you think your classmates would be supportive if you shared your focus techniques with them?

User: I think some of them might like it! We could help each other out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Collaborating with classmates can create a supportive environment. How do you feel about sharing your experiences, and what do you think you might say to them?

User: I could tell them about making lists. I think they would understand and might even want to try it too!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to engage with your classmates! Sharing what works for you can inspire them to try different techniques. Let’s also think about a reward for yourself when you successfully stay focused. What’s something you would enjoy?

User: I’d like to play video games for a bit or maybe have a snack I enjoy.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent rewards! Setting up a system where you earn your rewards based on your focus can motivate you. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel more confident! It sounds like a good plan, and I’m excited to try it out.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that you're feeling more confident. Remember, it’s about progress, and you’re already on the right track. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ll work on until our next meeting.

User: I’ll make a list of tasks, focus on one at a time, take breaks, and share my strategies with my classmates.

Consultant: Great summary! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to ask for help if you need it. I believe in you, Roberto! 

User: Thank you! I feel much better about tackling this.

Consultant: Hello, Roberto! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling about your classroom behavior since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident, actually. I realized that when I manage my behavior better, things in class become a lot smoother. I want to share this with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds great! It's wonderful to hear that you're noticing the positive effects of your behavior. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been managing your behavior?

User: Well, I've been trying hard to focus and not get too distracted. When I do that, I think my teachers notice and it makes our class feel better.

Consultant: It's impressive that you're noticing this connection between your actions and the classroom environment. How does it feel when you receive that kind of recognition from your teachers?

User: It feels really good! I like when they say I'm being helpful. It makes me want to keep doing well.

Consultant: That's a fantastic motivation! Would you like to explore ways to share your experiences with your classmates? How do you think they might react if you tell them?

User: I think they might be surprised, but some of them might want to try it too if they see how it helps me.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Sharing your experience could inspire them. What do you think is the best way to start that conversation with them?

User: Maybe I could share it during recess? We often talk about school stuff then.

Consultant: Recess sounds like a perfect time to do that! How do you feel about approaching that conversation with them?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I really want to try. I think it would be cool to see if it works for others too.

Consultant: It’s totally normal to feel nervous, especially when sharing something personal. Would it help if we practiced what you might say?

User: Sure, that could be good! I’m not really sure how to start.

Consultant: How about starting with a simple statement, like "Hey guys, I've been working on my focus in class, and it's been going well for me"? What do you think of that?

User: I like that! It sounds friendly and not too serious.

Consultant: Absolutely! And you can follow up with a question like, "Have any of you tried something similar?" This invites them to share too. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! It would be cool to hear their thoughts.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way. It’s also a nice way to open a dialogue. Do you have any concerns about how they might react?

User: What if they don’t care or think it’s silly?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Remember, people react in different ways. If they don’t show interest, it doesn’t mean what you’re doing isn’t valuable. What’s important is that you’re sharing something that has helped you. How would you handle that kind of reaction?

User: I could just say that it works for me and they can try it if they want.

Consultant: Exactly! You can let them know it’s just your experience and they can choose what they want to do with that information. Is there anything else you’d like to prepare before trying this out?

User: Maybe I should think of a specific example of when it helped me. That way, I can explain it better.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing a personal example can make your experience more relatable and powerful. Do you have an example in mind already?

User: Yes! There was a day I really focused, and I finished my math work quickly. The teacher even said I did great, which made me feel awesome!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example to share! It highlights your success and the positive feedback from your teacher. How do you feel about this conversation we’ve had today?

User: I feel much more ready to talk to my friends about it. I’m excited!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Roberto! You’ve made significant progress today, both in your understanding and in preparing to share with others. Remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How could you reward yourself after this conversation with your classmates?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to some ice cream if it goes well!

Consultant: Ice cream sounds like a perfect reward! It’s important to acknowledge your efforts. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember as you move forward?

User: I want to remember that sharing my experiences can help others, and it can also make me feel good!

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a beautiful takeaway, Roberto. You’re doing an amazing job. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Roberto! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session regarding your classroom behavior?

User: Hi! I feel really good! I've been trying to use the new strategies we talked about, and it's been nice having my teacher recognize my efforts.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've built some trust with your teacher, which is a great step forward. Can you share a bit more about what strategies you've implemented?

User: Sure! I've been reminding myself to stay calm and focus on my work. I also tell myself that if I stay quiet, I can reward myself later, like with some extra playtime.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach, Roberto! It’s great that you're using self-rewards as motivation. How has it felt to practice self-regulation in the classroom?

User: It feels nice! I enjoy making my teacher happy and I feel proud when I manage to stay focused. It's like I’m proving to myself that I can do it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent feeling! It seems like you're really learning and growing from this experience. What has been the most rewarding moment for you so far?

User: I think when my teacher praised me in front of the class! Everyone looked at me, and I felt really proud. It made me want to keep doing well.

Consultant: Being recognized can be such a powerful motivator! It seems like that positive feedback really boosted your confidence. How do you think you can extend this success beyond the classroom, perhaps in other settings?

User: Hmm, maybe I can use some of the same rewards at home. If I finish my homework quietly, I could earn game time or something like that.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Applying what you’ve learned at home can help reinforce those positive behaviors. How do you feel about setting specific goals for your self-management at home?

User: I think I can do that! Maybe I can try to keep my room tidy and earn a reward for that too.

Consultant: Setting goals for self-management in different areas is a great way to practice! Let’s brainstorm some specific rewards you might use at home. What kind of things can motivate you?

User: I really like video games, so if I can play for a bit longer, that would motivate me a lot. 

Consultant: Video games can be a great reward! Have you thought about how you want to balance your game time with other responsibilities?

User: Yes, I think I could set a timer. If I tidy up and finish my homework first, then I can play for an hour as a reward.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Balancing responsibilities with rewards can really help you stay motivated. How does this plan make you feel about the upcoming days?

User: I feel excited! I want to try this out and see if it works. I think it will make me more responsible.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that excitement! Taking responsibility is a big step forward. If you encounter challenges along the way, what do you think you might do to stay on track?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of the rewards I’ll get. And if I mess up, I can just try again.

Consultant: That’s a mature attitude, Roberto! Remembering to be patient with yourself is key. Do you feel that having this mindset will help strengthen your efforts?

User: Yes, I think so! I don’t want to give up. I want to keep improving.

Consultant: I can see that determination in you. Continuing to work on self-improvement is very commendable. As we move forward, how can I support you in maintaining this momentum?

User: Maybe we can check in on my goals next time and see how I did? I’d like to share my progress!

Consultant: That sounds perfect! We'll review your goals and celebrate your successes next time. It’s important to acknowledge your achievements. 

User: I'm looking forward to it! I feel good about sharing what I've accomplished.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it as well, Roberto! You’ve made great strides in your self-management, and sharing your journey is valuable. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're most welcome! Remember, you’re doing an amazing job building these skills. Keep up the great work, and we'll see each other again soon!

Consultant: That's great to hear! You’re taking a proactive approach. As you prepare to share your experiences, what might be a challenge you could face, and how can you overcome it?

User: I guess I might get nervous when I talk or forget what I wanted to say. Maybe if I take a deep breath before I start, it would help.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent tool to calm your nerves! Practicing that before speaking can really make a difference. What else can you do to keep yourself motivated in maintaining your good behavior in class?

User: I could set little goals for myself, like staying focused during one lesson each day. If I do that, I can reward myself with a small treat.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Roberto! Setting achievable goals and rewarding yourself for meeting them can help maintain your motivation. What would be a good reward for you?

User: I really like playing video games, so I could tell myself I can play for a bit longer if I stay focused.

User: I think it’s about helping others and staying focused myself. I have a plan now to share my tips, and I feel ready!
