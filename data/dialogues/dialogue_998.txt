Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fan! I'm glad you're here for our session today. Before we dive in, I want to check in on how you’ve been feeling since we last talked. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. Sometimes, I wake up at night and can’t sleep because I hear this ringing in my ears. It’s frustrating, and I feel so tired during the day. My parents are always arguing, and it makes me feel so upset and guilty afterward.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Fan. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re dealing with so much noise and conflict at home. Can we talk more about how your parents’ arguments affect you?

User: Yes, it’s hard to see them fight. I feel like I should do something to make it better, but I don't know what to do. I often end up getting angry, and then I feel bad for reacting that way.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. It seems like you're caught in the middle, wanting to help but also feeling frustrated. Let’s explore those feelings. When you feel anger, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that maybe if I were a better daughter, they wouldn’t fight. I worry a lot that it’s my fault or that I'm not enough for them.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiao Fan. It’s common to feel this way, especially when we want to please those we care about. However, it’s important to remember that their arguments are about them, not you. Can you see any patterns in your thoughts that might be contributing to how you feel?

User: I guess sometimes I do jump to thinking it’s my fault or that I’m not doing well enough. It makes me feel really low.

Consultant: Recognizing that pattern is a big step! It sounds like you might be experiencing negative thoughts that are affecting your self-esteem. Let's challenge some of those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that the fighting is your fault?

User: I can’t really think of anything specific, but it just feels that way when they argue about my schoolwork or my behavior.

Consultant: It’s understandable to connect their arguments to your performance, but do you think they are arguing solely because of you? What if there are other reasons why they’re having these conflicts?

User: I guess they have their own issues. My dad is often away, and my mom works hard to keep everything going. Maybe I just feel responsible because I’m here all the time.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful observation, Xiao Fan. It sounds like you might be feeling a sense of responsibility for their relationship when, in fact, it’s beyond your control. How can we shift your focus from feeling responsible to taking care of your own emotional well-being?

User: I think maybe I can try to remind myself that it’s not my responsibility. But it’s hard to stay calm during those moments.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be quite difficult. One technique we can explore is developing coping strategies for those moments when you feel overwhelmed. Have you ever tried any relaxing activities to help you manage your emotions?

User: Sometimes I draw or listen to music, but I haven't been very consistent with it lately.

Consultant: Those are great activities! They can help you regain calmness and provide an outlet for your feelings. How about we create a plan together for when you start feeling anxious or upset? We could include drawing and listening to music consistently.

User: That sounds good. I think having a plan would really help me know what to do when things get tough.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s write down that plan. We could also consider adding some moments for deep breathing or meditation to help ground you. Would you like to explore that as well?

User: Yes, I’ve heard about meditation before. I’d like to try it!

Consultant: Great! Meditation can help you focus and calm your mind. We can practice some simple techniques together. How do you feel about starting with a few minutes of breathing exercises right now?

User: I would like that! I need help to feel less anxious.

Consultant: Let’s begin. Find a comfortable position, and take a deep breath in… hold… and now slowly breathe out. As you do this, focus on your breathing and let go of those worries. How are you feeling so far?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It’s nice to just focus on my breath for a moment.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Just a few moments of focus can help you feel more centered. How can you remind yourself to use this technique when you start feeling overwhelmed at home?

User: I could set a reminder on my phone or post a note on my desk to remember to breathe when things get hard.

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea, Xiao Fan! It’s about building those small habits that can make a big difference. Let’s also reflect on your feelings about your parents’ conflicts. What can you do to create a mental space for yourself during their arguments?

User: Maybe I could play my favorite music or go to my room when they argue. That way, I’m not in the middle of it.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Creating that physical space can really help you protect your emotional well-being. It’s about finding ways to prioritize yourself in tough situations. How are you feeling about these strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel hopeful. It helps to talk about these things and know I have a plan.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Xiao Fan! Remember, it’s okay to feel your emotions, and you’ve taken steps toward managing them better. Before we finish up today, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to explore?

User: I just worry about whether I can really stick to this plan, especially with everything going on.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have concerns about sticking to new routines, but remember to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and it’s okay to start small. If things get tough, you can always come back and adjust the plan together.

User: That makes me feel better. Thank you for the reminder.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s review what you’ve gained and the strategies you can use moving forward. You’ve made great progress in understanding your feelings and developing new coping mechanisms. How do you feel about the journey ahead?

User: I feel more empowered. Knowing I have support helps a lot.

Consultant: I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made, Xiao Fan. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and you have skills to help you manage. If you ever need to talk again or need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll try to use everything we talked about.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in you, and I’m looking forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Fan! It's great to see you again. I'm here to help you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better in terms of understanding my emotions, but I still feel really overwhelmed by my parents' fighting. It's hard to focus on anything, especially with school going on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're making progress in understanding your emotions. However, it sounds like the situation at home is still quite challenging for you. Can you share more about what happens when your parents argue and how it affects you?

User: They yell a lot, and I just feel really sad and helpless. It makes me feel like I can’t do anything right, and then I get anxious about school too. Like, when my teacher asks why I didn’t do my homework, I feel so embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Fan. It’s normal to feel sad and anxious in such a situation. It seems like those feelings might be making it hard for you to perform at school. Let's talk a bit more about your thoughts during those moments. What goes through your mind when your teacher questions you about your homework?

User: I think, "I’m a failure," and "I’ll never be good enough." It just feels like everything is piling up on me.

Consultant: I understand that those thoughts can be really heavy. It's important to recognize that these thoughts might be a bit extreme. Have you ever considered if there are alternative ways to view these situations? 

User: I guess I could think that maybe I'm just having a tough time and that it's okay to ask for help sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much more compassionate thought. Sometimes, we need to give ourselves a break and recognize that it's okay to struggle. How do you feel about exploring some techniques to challenge those negative thoughts when they come up?

User: I would like that. I want to stop feeling so bad about myself.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can use is to ask ourselves questions about those negative thoughts. For example, when you think, "I’m a failure," you might ask, "What evidence do I have to support this thought?" What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds interesting. I guess I could think about times when I did well, like when I passed my last math test.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering your successes can really help balance those negative thoughts. Now, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about how you can protect your emotional space during your parents' arguments. Have you thought about any strategies you can use?

User: Sometimes I go to my room and listen to music, but I'm not sure if that's enough.

Consultant: That's a good start! Creating a personal space for yourself is important. We can also explore other activities that might help you feel more grounded. What activities make you feel relaxed or happy?

User: I like drawing and reading. They help me forget for a while.

Consultant: Drawing and reading are wonderful outlets for your feelings! How about we make a plan to use these activities more frequently, especially when you hear your parents arguing? 

User: Yes, that sounds good! I can set aside some time every day to draw or read.

Consultant: Fantastic! This way, you can have some time for yourself and focus on something that brings you joy. Additionally, if you're comfortable, we could practice some communication skills that might help you express your feelings to your parents in a calm way. Would that be something you're interested in?

User: I think I’d like to try that. It’s hard to talk to them when they fight though.

Consultant: I understand that it can be difficult. We can start with small steps. Imagine telling them how you feel during a calm moment. We can role-play that if you’d like. What’s something you would want to express to them?

User: Maybe I would say that their fighting makes me feel anxious and sad.

Consultant: That’s a very brave thing to express! It’s honest, and it shows how much you care. It might help to say it when they’re both calm. Would you like to think of a way to approach that conversation?

User: I could ask them if we could talk after dinner when things are quieter.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Being mindful of the right timing can make a big difference. Now, as we move forward, let’s discuss setting some goals for yourself. What would you like to achieve in your social interactions with new friends?

User: I want to feel more confident talking to them. Sometimes I get shy, especially if I think they’ll judge me.

Consultant: Building that confidence is very achievable! Let’s think about small steps you can take to engage with them. Maybe starting with a compliment or a simple question could be effective. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, I could compliment their drawings or ask about their favorite books.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing interests can really help break the ice. After practicing these skills, how do you think you will feel about your interactions with them?

User: I hope I’ll feel less shy and more comfortable being myself.

Consultant: That seems like a wonderful goal to work towards! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some of the strategies we discussed. You’ll practice challenging negative thoughts, establish a space for your creativity, and work on expressing your feelings to your parents. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiao Fan! Remember, it’s a journey, and taking these steps will help you gain more confidence over time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to remind yourself of the progress you've made. This is our last session for now, but I believe you have the tools to manage your emotions. You're always welcome to come back if you need further support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and best of luck with everything. Remember to be kind to yourself during this process.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofan! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your new friends?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit confused. I'm excited that I have new friends, but when I talk to them, I don’t feel comfortable, and I'm not sure what to say. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling both excitement and uncertainty at the same time. That's very normal when making new friends. Can you share a specific instance where you felt uncomfortable while talking to them?

User: Well, the other day, we were talking about our favorite movies, but I couldn't think of anything to add. I felt left out, and I think I came off as boring.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you really wanted to contribute to the conversation, but you felt at a loss. When you couldn't think of something to say, how did that make you feel in that moment?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit anxious. I kept thinking that they wouldn’t want to be friends with me anymore.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely understandable. It sounds like you were worried about how they might perceive you. Let's explore that thought—do you think there's a possibility that your friends would still appreciate your company even if you don’t always have a lot to say?

User: I never thought about it that way. I guess they might just be happy that I'm there!

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes just being present can be enough. Let's think about how we can prepare for future conversations. What topics do you enjoy or feel comfortable talking about?

User: I really like drawing and animals! I could probably talk more about those.

Consultant: Those are great topics! How about we try a little role-playing? We can simulate a conversation where you share your interests. I’ll pretend to be one of your friends. Would you like to give it a try?

User: Sure! I think that could help.

Consultant: Great! So, let’s set the scene. Imagine we’re chatting during lunch at school, and I ask you about your favorite hobby. Go ahead!

User: Um, hey! So, I really like drawing. I spend a lot of time sketching animals, especially dogs.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Dogs are such fun animals. What do you enjoy most about drawing them?

User: I like trying to capture their expressions. I find it relaxing too!

Consultant: Wow, that’s really interesting! You’ve done an excellent job of sharing your thoughts. How did it feel to talk about something you're passionate about?

User: It felt nice! I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I would be.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Focusing on your passions can make conversations flow more easily. Now, let's think about recognizing and challenging any negative thoughts if they arise during these interactions. What thoughts cross your mind when you feel anxious?

User: I often think they won't like me or that I’ll say something wrong.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. Let’s challenge them. What evidence do you have that proves they wouldn’t like you or that you’ll mess up?

User: I don’t really have much evidence. I guess it's just my fear talking.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to recognize that fear. Next time you find yourself in a similar situation, you can remind yourself of this realization. What positive statements could replace those negative thoughts?

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "I have good things to share, and it’s okay to not be perfect."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! With practice, you’ll be able to use these positive reminders during your conversations. Do you feel more confident about talking to your friends now?

User: Yes, I do! I think I can try using what we talked about.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it takes time to adjust, and each conversation is a new chance to express yourself. Would you like to set a small goal for your next interaction with your friends?

User: I want to share something about my drawings next time and listen to what they like too!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! By sharing your interests and encouraging them to share theirs, you’ll have a more engaging dialogue. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel more positive! I have some ideas on how to improve my conversations.

Consultant: I’m so happy to hear that! As we wrap up today, I'd like you to remember that social skills take practice, and you're already taking great steps forward. If you encounter any challenges, we can work on them together in the future.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaofan! Remember, I'm here whenever you need support. Keep practicing your conversations and enjoy the time with your friends!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofan! It's great to see you again today. Last time, we talked about how you've been managing your emotions through journaling. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've felt quite good, actually. Writing in my journal has really helped me relax and process my thoughts. I find it enjoyable and calming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like journaling has become a positive outlet for you. Can you share some specific emotions or thoughts you've recorded lately?

User: Well, I often write about my days at school. Sometimes I feel anxious before tests, but then I also write about how finishing my assignments makes me feel accomplished. It feels good to reflect on that.

Consultant: It seems like you’re noticing a pattern in your feelings during school. Recognizing those moments of accomplishment is a great step. How do you usually feel immediately after you finish your assignments?

User: I feel relieved and proud of myself. It’s like a weight lifts off my shoulders. But before that, I can get really stressed out.

Consultant: I understand. That stress before completing assignments is common. Have you thought about what specific thoughts come to mind when you feel stressed about your work?

User: Yes, I often think, "What if I don't do well?" or "I'm going to disappoint my mom." Those thoughts make me really nervous.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely create a lot of pressure. Let’s explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that not doing well would disappoint your mom? Are there other ways she might show support?

User: I guess she just wants me to do well because she cares. But I also know she gets stressed about my schoolwork too, so maybe she would understand if I struggle a bit.

Consultant: That’s a very mature perspective. It seems like you recognize her intentions come from a place of care. What if you shifted your thoughts to something more supportive, like, "I’m doing my best and it’s okay to ask for help"?

User: That sounds comforting. I usually don’t think about it that way. I just get stuck in my worries.

Consultant: It's normal to get caught in those worries. Practicing more supportive thinking can take time, but journaling about these new thoughts can help reinforce them. How do you think writing down these supportive thoughts might impact your stress levels?

User: I think it would help me feel calmer if I could see those positive thoughts written out. It might remind me that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Putting your supportive thoughts on paper can serve as a powerful reminder. Would you be willing to start writing down those affirmations in your journal regularly?

User: Yes, I can do that! I’m excited to try.

Consultant: That’s a great commitment! As you continue to write, pay attention to any changes in your feelings or stress levels. We can discuss how that goes in our next session. Is there anything you’d like to add or clarify before we finish today?

User: No, I think that covers it! I feel really good about this new approach.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's normal to have ups and downs, and you're doing a fantastic job by reflecting on your feelings. I look forward to hearing how your journaling goes next time. Keep up the great work, Xiaofan!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm so glad to have you here today! It's great to see that you’ve been feeling more confident in yourself lately. Can you share how that experience has been for you?

User: Hi! Yes, it’s been nice. After the school mental health week, I received some praise from my teacher, and it made me feel really good about myself.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like the recognition from your teacher had a positive impact on your self-esteem. How have you been feeling about your achievements lately?

User: I feel like I’m doing better in school and I’m starting to believe that I can keep improving. But sometimes I still worry about not being good enough.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're starting to believe in your abilities! However, it's normal to have worries about not being good enough. Can you tell me more about those thoughts? What specifically makes you feel that way?

User: Sometimes I think that if I don’t get top marks, I’m not trying hard enough. I guess I just put a lot of pressure on myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you hold yourself to very high standards. This can lead to feeling stressed and anxious. What do you think would happen if you didn’t achieve those top marks?

User: I feel like I would disappoint my mom and maybe my teacher would think less of me.

Consultant: That’s understandable, especially with the expectations you feel from your mom and school. But let’s think about it—do you think your worth is solely based on your grades?

User: I suppose not. But it's hard to separate my self-worth from my performance.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s a common struggle. Can you think of moments where you felt proud of yourself that didn’t involve grades or academic performance?

User: Well, I felt really good when I helped a friend who was upset. I liked being there for her.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization! Helping others is a wonderful way to value yourself. Let’s use that feeling as a positive affirmation. How about repeating to yourself, “I am valuable for the kindness I show, not just my grades"?

User: I think I can try that. It feels nice to focus on kindness instead of just marks.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Practicing this positive self-talk can help reinforce your self-worth. How do you feel about setting a daily reminder to repeat this affirmation? 

User: I’d like that! Maybe I can write it down somewhere I see every day.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing it down will make it more tangible. As you continue this practice, how do you think it will change how you feel about challenges at school?

User: I think it will help me feel less anxious. If I remember that I am more than just my grades, I might approach things differently.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re starting to see the connection between mindset and your feelings. Let’s talk about any upcoming challenges you might face. Is there anything coming up that you’re feeling uncertain about?

User: Yes, there’s a school project I’m a bit worried about. I want it to be really good!

Consultant: It’s normal to feel concern about projects, especially when you want to do well! What if we broke it down into smaller steps? What’s the first thing you could do to get started?

User: I guess I could brainstorm ideas first instead of trying to make it perfect right away.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant start! Focusing on the brainstorming will take the pressure off. What else can you do to remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes during this process?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that it’s part of learning? I could see mistakes as a chance to improve.

Consultant: Exactly! Viewing mistakes as opportunities is a powerful perspective. Can we think of a couple of affirmations together that support this new mindset?

User: How about “Mistakes help me grow” and “I am learning every step of the way”?

Consultant: Those affirmations are perfect! They empower you to embrace the process of learning. Let’s commit to integrating these affirmations into your daily routine. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel more encouraged already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Do you have any strategies in mind for how to maintain this positive approach as you work on your project?

User: I think I’ll check in with myself regularly and see if I'm remembering to be kind to myself.

Consultant: That’s a wise decision! Regular check-ins can help you stay grounded. As we approach the end of our session, let’s review what we’ve achieved today. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I guess it’s that my self-worth isn’t just tied to my grades and that I can focus on my kindness and growth instead.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! You’ve made wonderful progress in understanding your self-worth and developing new strategies. How do you plan to continue this growth in the coming weeks?

User: I want to keep repeating my affirmations and take things one step at a time with my schoolwork.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, you can always return if you need additional support. You’ve done so well today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited for you and your journey ahead. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaofan! I’m glad to see you here today. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I feel much better than before. My mom is giving me more space, and I’m able to decide how to manage my study time. It's nice to have some control.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive change! Having that space must help you feel more empowered. Can you share a bit about how you've been managing your time?

User: Well, I try to set a schedule for myself and stick to it. It’s challenging sometimes, but I feel proud when I accomplish what I planned.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Setting a schedule is a very effective way to manage your time. What accomplishment are you most proud of recently?

User: I managed to finish a project ahead of time! This is the first time I didn’t rush at the last minute, and it felt good.

Consultant: That’s an impressive achievement, Xiaofan! Finishing a project ahead of time can really boost your confidence. How did that make you feel about your abilities?

User: It made me feel more capable and less anxious about my work. I think I can handle things better now.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you're feeling more capable. Can you tell me more about how you've been dealing with anxiety in other areas of your life?

User: I used to get really anxious about talking to other kids, but I've been trying to be more open. I even started a conversation with a classmate last week.

Consultant: That’s a significant step! Starting a conversation can be daunting. How did it feel to reach out to your classmate?

User: It was scary at first, but once we started talking, it became easier. I just talked about our homework, and it wasn’t awkward.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you managed to push through that initial fear. Have you thought about how you might continue to build those conversations?

User: I think I would like to keep talking to her. Maybe join some activities to meet more people, but I’m a bit nervous about that.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about joining new activities. What kind of activities are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about maybe joining the art club or the drama club. I like both, but I don't know anyone in those clubs.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent choices! Art and drama can be great ways to express yourself and meet new people. How can I support you in taking that next step?

User: Maybe I could practice introducing myself first. I haven't done that much, and it seems like a good start.

Consultant: Practicing introductions is a solid idea! Would you like to try creating a simple introduction now together?

User: Sure! I could say something like, “Hi, I’m Xiaofan, and I’m new to the club. I love art/drama.”

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s friendly and straightforward. How do you feel about using that introduction?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. I think I could remember that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about being yourself. What do you think you can do if the conversation feels a bit awkward?

User: I could try to ask questions about what they like or share something about myself. That could help keep the chat going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking questions can help ease any awkwardness. What kinds of questions are you thinking you might ask?

User: Maybe I could ask what projects they’ve worked on or what they enjoy about the club.

Consultant: Those are great questions! They’re open-ended, which encourages conversation. How are you feeling about reaching out after practicing this introduction and questions?

User: I feel much better! I think I’ll definitely give it a try at the next meeting.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You seem committed to continuing your progress. How do you envision staying on top of your emotions and social interactions in the future?

User: I’ll try to remember what we've talked about. When I feel anxious, I can remind myself of my successes and keep pushing through.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy, Xiaofan! Reflecting on your successes can really bolster your confidence. Are there any other resources or strategies you feel could help you?

User: I think I might like to keep a journal about my feelings and experiences. That might help me process everything.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent idea! It can help you reflect on your experiences. How do you feel about making that part of your routine?

User: I think I can manage that. It sounds helpful.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress and the strategies you’ve developed. What do you see as your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I feel I've learned to manage my time better, talk to others, and express my feelings. It’s been really helpful!

Consultant: You’ve made significant strides, Xiaofan! Remember, you have the tools to continue your progress. If you face challenges, you can always reach out. Thank you for sharing and working hard today!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.
