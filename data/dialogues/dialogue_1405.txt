Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m still feeling quite anxious. I keep worrying about how I reacted when I saw those classmates at the fast-food place. I can't seem to shake off that feeling.

Consultant: It sounds like that encounter really impacted you, and you’re feeling a lot of anxiety reflecting on it. Can you share what specific thoughts crossed your mind during that moment?

User: I remember thinking that everyone was judging me or laughing at me. I felt really embarrassed and just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, especially in social situations. Those judgments we think others have can really heighten our anxiety. Do you think those thoughts are based on any evidence, or do you think they might be a bit extreme?

User: I guess they are extreme. I mean, they didn't really say anything bad, but in my head, it felt so real.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Sometimes our minds can create scenarios that feel true but are actually distorted. How did that thought of being judged make you feel physically and emotionally at that moment?

User: My heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to sweat. It was just overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It makes a lot of sense why you'd want to avoid those situations to escape that feeling. Have you noticed other situations that trigger similar feelings for you?

User: Yeah, it happens often in group settings or even when I have to speak up in class. I immediately feel that pressure.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a pattern there. Recognizing that can help us tackle each situation more effectively. What do you think might happen if you tried to stay in those situations a bit longer, instead of avoiding them?

User: I fear it would just get worse. I’m afraid I'd make a fool of myself.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but what if we challenge that thought? If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say it’s okay to be nervous and that no one is really focused on them as much as they think.

Consultant: Exactly! When you shift the perspective, it can help lessen that weight of judgment. How can we apply that kind of understanding when you’re about to face a similar situation in the future?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their own stuff going on and that it's normal to feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy. Also, it might help to create a small plan for facing these situations progressively. What small steps do you think you could take to build your confidence in social settings?

User: I could start by joining a study group. It’s a controlled situation where I can get comfortable being around others.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in a supportive environment can help ease into social interactions. Do you feel ready to take that step?

User: I’m nervous, but I think I can do it. It might help me feel a bit better.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel nervous. Remember to reflect on your thoughts during this experience—if those old patterns of judgment pop up, we can discuss strategies to challenge them. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to be able to speak up without feeling so much pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practice will certainly help. Let's also consider some relaxation techniques to use before entering a social setting. What do you think about incorporating some deep breathing exercises?

User: I think that could help calm me down. I usually feel so tense just thinking about being around people.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a powerful tool. It allows your body to relax and can help clear your mind. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise right now?

User: Sure, I’d like to!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale through your nose for a count of four... hold for four... and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. How did that feel?

User: That actually felt nice. I felt a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Integrating these moments of mindfulness into your day can really support you in managing anxiety. As we start to wrap up today, what is one takeaway you feel you can apply this week?

User: I think I’ll focus on participating in that study group and remembering that I’m not alone in my feelings.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan! Remember, progress takes time and practice. You're doing great work by acknowledging these challenges and seeking ways to handle them. If you continue to put in this effort, I'm confident you’ll see positive changes.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and insights.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been great working with you, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care, and remember, you’re not alone in this journey!

Consultant: Hello, M! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking about our last talk a lot. But honestly, I'm still feeling quite anxious, especially about social interactions. I really struggle when I'm in group settings.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel anxious in social situations, especially after experiencing discomfort in the class. Can you tell me more about what happened during the discussion in your training course?

User: Well, one of my classmates suddenly invited me to share my thoughts. I panicked and made up an excuse to leave. It was really embarrassing, and I felt like everyone was judging me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, M. It’s common to feel that way, especially when you're put on the spot. What thoughts went through your mind right before you had to respond to your classmate?

User: I started thinking that I probably wouldn’t say anything intelligent and that everyone would think I’m stupid. Those thoughts really held me back.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It seems like you were experiencing a lot of pressure and self-doubt. How did those thoughts make you feel in that moment?

User: I felt really nervous and my heart was racing. I just wanted to escape.

Consultant: That’s a very human reaction. You wanted to avoid the discomfort. Let’s explore those negative thoughts a bit more. How likely do you think it is that your classmates were judging you as harshly as you thought?

User: I don’t know, maybe not that much. But it felt real to me at the time.

Consultant: It makes sense for you to feel that way. What if we challenged that thought? If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about their fears of being judged?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own insecurities and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you recognize that everyone struggles. Perhaps you could apply that same understanding to yourself. What might change if you tried to see your situation in a kinder light?

User: I guess I’d feel less pressure to be perfect. Maybe I could just focus on sharing my thoughts without putting so much weight on how others perceive me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on your own thoughts rather than others’ perceptions can help ease some of that pressure. Let’s think about some small steps you could take to practice speaking up. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think that could help. What do you propose?

Consultant: How about starting with low-stakes environments? You could practice sharing your thoughts in smaller, more comfortable settings before re-engaging in larger discussions. How does that sound?

User: That sounds feasible. I could try sharing in discussions with just one or two people first.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, M! By gradually easing into these situations, you’ll likely find it becomes a bit less daunting over time. What do you think would be a good first step?

User: Maybe I could start by participating in smaller study groups before the next session. That way, I can get used to speaking up again.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! A smaller group can help build your confidence. How do you feel about setting a goal to participate next time?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but also excited to try. I really want to overcome this.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both anxious and excited—those feelings can coexist. Just remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take baby steps. How can you remind yourself of that when you feel overwhelmed next time?

User: I think I could write a small note to myself saying 'It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.' 

Consultant: That’s a very supportive reminder. Keeping that note handy might help you manage any anxious thoughts that come up. Would you like to brainstorm some more techniques for managing those feelings during social interactions?

User: Yes, I’d love that. I think having a few strategies could make a big difference.

Consultant: Excellent! One technique could be practicing deep breathing to calm yourself before speaking. Another could be visualizing a positive outcome before a social situation. Have you ever tried these kinds of techniques before?

User: I haven’t really tried them. But I’m willing to see if they work for me.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s all about experimenting with what feels right for you. How about we set a plan for you to try these techniques before your next small group session?

User: Sure! I think practicing breathing exercises could be really helpful.

Consultant: Great! We can also review your experiences in our next session. You can let me know how it went and how you felt afterward. Remember, every step you take is a step toward progress.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your encouragement. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: Absolutely, M! You’re taking important steps towards your goals. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you face any setbacks, that’s completely okay. We’ll work through them together.

User: That really helps calm my worries. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that. Moving forward, I encourage you to be kind to yourself. You are capable of learning and growing. We’ll continue to explore these techniques in our future sessions.

User: Thank you again! I’m looking forward to trying this out.

Consultant: You're very welcome, M. I'm excited to hear about your experiences next time. You're taking great steps toward managing your anxiety. Let’s keep building on this momentum!

User: Definitely! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, M! I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we discussed your experience with anticipated anxiety during social situations. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been quite anxious, especially thinking about social gatherings. I've been trying to push myself, but it’s challenging. I even missed the chance to speak during a group discussion I really wanted to contribute to.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been wrestling with a lot of anxiety, especially the fear of speaking up. What do you think was going through your mind at that moment when you wanted to contribute but felt unable to?

User: I just kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I spoke. My mind was racing with “what if” scenarios, and I felt like everyone would judge me.

Consultant: That must have been really tough for you, feeling judged before you even had a chance to speak. It seems like those thoughts were quite powerful in stopping you from participating. Can we explore what specific thoughts you had in that moment? 

User: Sure. I remember thinking, "What if they think I’m stupid?" or "What if I get my words mixed up?" Those thoughts just made my heart race even more.

Consultant: Those thoughts are definitely understandable, but they can feel overwhelming. Let’s take a closer look at them—how strong do you think the evidence is for those fears? Have you ever seen someone embarrassed while speaking, and did it lead to lasting negative judgments from others?

User: Well, not really. I usually see people being supportive after someone struggles. I guess I don’t often remember that when it’s my turn.

Consultant: That's a great observation, M! It sounds like your thoughts may be a bit exaggerated. If you were to think differently in those moments, perhaps something more positive or realistic, what might that sound like?

User: I suppose I could think, "It’s okay to make mistakes; everyone does," or "I can share my thoughts, and people will listen."

Consultant: Those thoughts are much more supportive! They might help ease the anxiety and encourage you to speak up. Let’s practice reframing your thoughts. Next time you feel that anxiety, how about you remind yourself of those positive statements? 

User: That might help, but I still worry about social situations. 

Consultant: It's completely valid to feel that way, especially given your experiences. Let’s also discuss how we can gradually expose you to speaking in social situations. What are some smaller social interactions you might feel comfortable trying first?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my opinion with a friend or two, in a more relaxed setting. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic first step! Practicing with friends can offer a great supportive environment. How do you feel about setting a specific time to do this? 

User: I think I could do this on the weekend when I have more time to relax.

Consultant: Wonderful! That gives you a target to work towards. Along with this, have you considered trying breathing techniques to help with your anxiety before you speak?

User: No, I haven’t. How do those work?

Consultant: Breathing techniques involve taking deep, slow breaths to help calm your nervous system. Would you like to try a basic technique together right now? 

User: Sure, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… and hold it for a moment… now slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do this a couple more times. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice actually; I can feel my heart rate slowing down a bit. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this technique can help anchor you when anxiety starts creeping in. As we’ve discussed your plans, are there any concerns or questions about what we’ve covered today?

User: I’m just worried that I might forget to use those techniques in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a common concern! How about we think of some reminders you could use? Maybe setting a note on your phone or even asking a friend to help prompt you when you start feeling anxious?

User: I could do that! I usually check my phone often.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Remember, it’s all about progress. Celebrate those small successes when you speak up, even if it feels uncomfortable. How do you think you might feel after trying these out?

User: I feel like I could gain more confidence. I actually want to continue trying. 

Consultant: That’s empowering to hear! As we conclude our session today, do you feel more hopeful about taking these steps into your future social interactions?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel like I have a plan, and I’m ready to work on it.

Consultant: Excellent! Keep reminding yourself of those positive thoughts and techniques. I look forward to hearing all about your progress next time. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need more support along the way. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, M! Take care, and we’ll catch up soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello M! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you've been engaging in some social activities recently. How did those experiences go for you?

User: Hi! Yes, actually, I participated in a small event organized by my training class. I felt some anxiety, but I also noticed that it was a bit less than before. It felt good to be around others.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward! It’s great to hear you’re feeling a bit less anxious. What specific moments during the event did you find enjoyable?

User: I enjoyed talking to a few people and even shared some of my thoughts during a group discussion. It was nerve-wracking, but I felt proud afterward.

Consultant: Sharing your thoughts in a group is no small feat, especially considering your previous experiences with social anxiety. How did that sense of pride affect your feelings about future social interactions?

User: I think it made me more optimistic. I actually want to engage more in these kinds of activities, but there's still a lingering fear.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have some fear after stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you tell me more about the fears you still feel? What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about participating more frequently in social situations?

User: I worry that I might embarrass myself or that others will judge me. Sometimes, I recall past experiences where I felt awkward, and that makes me hesitant.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common and can be quite powerful. It's important to acknowledge them. Let’s try and explore one of those thoughts. For example, when you think, "I might embarrass myself," what evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: Well, I guess I can't really think of any recent examples where I actually embarrassed myself. I mean, at the event, I spoke without major issues.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It sounds like you’ve managed quite well at the event despite your fears. If a friend were in your position feeling anxious about embarrassing themselves, what would you advise them to consider?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the positive moments they've had and remember that others probably aren’t judging them as harshly as they think.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a great perspective when thinking about it in that way. Let's take that thought and begin to shift your mindset. Instead of focusing on potential embarrassment, how can you remind yourself of the positive experiences you've had during social interactions?

User: I can keep a journal to note down the positive experiences and how I felt after those interactions. That way, I can look back and remind myself that I can handle these situations.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Journaling can help reinforce those positive feelings and experiences. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself, like engaging in another social activity this week?

User: I’d like that! What if I set a goal to talk to at least one new person at the training class?

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and positive step forward, M! It’s specific and achievable. How might you prepare for this interaction to help ease some of your anxiety?

User: I could practice what I might say or ask. Maybe even think of some topics ahead of time that I know people might find interesting.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach, M! Preparing talking points can really help ease your nerves. Let's also consider how you can reward yourself after achieving this goal. What might motivate you to celebrate this small success?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or a little outing afterward.

Consultant: Great idea! Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, is important for reinforcing positive behavior. As we look ahead, let's also think about potential challenges. What do you think might make it hard to reach this goal?

User: I guess if I start feeling really anxious in the moment, I might back down or avoid talking altogether.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, M. It’s useful to prepare for those moments. If you start feeling anxious during the interaction, what techniques could you use to manage that anxiety?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself of the positive experiences… or maybe even excuse myself for a brief moment to collect my thoughts if I need to.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Taking a moment to breathe and regroup can be very helpful. How do you feel about your ability to manage anxiety in this way?

User: I feel more confident now! I believe I can handle it better with these techniques in mind.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you're making significant progress in both recognizing your anxieties and finding ways to cope. As our session is coming to an end, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and how you plan to move forward.

User: Sure! I’ll journal my positive social experiences, prepare for interactions at training, and aim to talk to one new person this week. And if I feel anxious, I'll use deep breathing or take a moment for myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, M! You've outlined a clear plan. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and reinforcing your successes. I believe you’re on a great path. If you encounter challenges, remember that it’s okay to return to these techniques. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’m looking forward to it as well!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. After the group project presentation, I felt a sense of achievement, which was unexpected for me. My confidence in social situations has definitely improved.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like completing the presentation positively impacted your self-confidence. Let's explore that feeling of achievement further—how did it feel to experience that success?

User: It felt really rewarding. I wasn't as nervous as I thought I'd be, and I even enjoyed presenting. It made me realize I can manage these social situations better than I previously thought.

Consultant: It seems like this experience shifted your perspective on social situations. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach interactions with others since then?

User: Yes, I find myself more willing to engage with classmates in conversations now. I think I'm feeling more at ease in those settings, which is a huge improvement for me.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress! This sense of ease is crucial in building your social confidence. Can you recall a specific moment where you felt particularly comfortable interacting with someone recently?

User: There was a time when I joined a discussion after class and shared my opinions on a topic. I wasn't panicking, and people seemed to appreciate my input, which felt great.

Consultant: That moment sounds significant. Sharing your thoughts and feeling appreciated can reinforce your sense of belonging. How did that experience influence your view on participating in future discussions?

User: It made me realize that my thoughts are valuable, and it feels good to contribute. I want to keep participating like that, even if it feels challenging sometimes.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight! Recognizing your value is essential. When you think about future situations where you might feel anxious, what strategies do you think you could use to remind yourself of this experience?

User: I could try reminding myself of how I felt when people responded positively to what I said. Maybe even thinking about the success of my presentation could help.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Visualizing your past successes can help reinforce your confidence in similar future situations. What do you think could be a good next step for you, on this journey of challenging yourself further?

User: I think maybe I could try leading a small group discussion next week, just to push myself a bit more. 

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive step! Leading a discussion could be a fantastic way to build on your current progress. How can you prepare yourself to feel more confident when you take on that role?

User: I could jot down some notes or key topics I want to discuss, so I feel more organized. And I can remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: Writing your thoughts down is an excellent way to prepare! Remember, feeling nervous is natural. You've successfully managed those feelings before, and you can do it again. As you approach this opportunity, how do you want to remind yourself of your achievements?

User: I could create a small note for myself that says “You've done it before, and you can do it again!” Something that’s positive and encouraging.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Having a tangible reminder can be very motivating. As we wrap up today, let’s look back at how much progress you’ve made—what do you feel has been the most significant change for you?

User: I think my increased willingness to engage in social interactions is the biggest change. I feel more capable and confident.

Consultant: That’s a remarkable achievement! Maintaining this positive mindset will certainly help you as you face new situations. What are some strategies you’d like to use to maintain this confidence moving forward?

User: I’d like to keep challenging myself with small interactions and remind myself of past successes. I think that will help a lot.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! As we finish our session today, remember that you've made significant strides. If you face challenges in the future, you have the tools to manage them. How are you feeling about all of this? 

User: I feel optimistic and excited to keep working on this. Thank you for the guidance!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of how far you've come. Remember, you're always welcome to share your experiences or seek support as you continue this journey. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How have you been since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've noticed some improvements lately. My social anxiety has lessened a bit, and I feel more confident engaging with my classmates in the computer training course. However, I still wonder if I can maintain this progress.

Consultant: That's positive to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some notable strides in your confidence and social interactions. Let’s reflect on what has contributed to these changes. Can you share specific moments when you felt more engaged in class or during interactions?

User: Sure! There were a few instances where I participated more in group discussions, and I even approached a classmate to study together. It felt satisfying, but there's still a lingering fear of judgment in those situations.

Consultant: It’s great that you reached out to study with a classmate—that's a significant step! It's natural to have some fear of judgment, especially when engaging socially. Can we explore those feelings in more detail? What thoughts come to mind when you fear being judged?

User: I often worry that others think I'm not knowledgeable enough or that I’ll make mistakes. This thought makes me hesitate to contribute or ask questions, even when I want to.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can indeed be overwhelming. Let’s examine this a bit more closely. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that others perceive you as not knowledgeable when you share your thoughts?

User: Thinking about it, I realize I have no concrete evidence for that. My classmates have been supportive, and they've never openly criticized me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like the fear of judgment might not be based on reality but rather an assumption. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to be brave and just share their thoughts because everyone is there to learn together. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful advice! You’ve demonstrated that you can encourage yourself as you would a friend. Can you think of ways to apply that supportive self-talk when you feel anxious about speaking up in class?

User: I could try to remind myself that everyone is learning and that making mistakes is part of the process. I think I will practice saying that to myself whenever I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Additionally, let’s consider your future social interactions. What strategies can we create together to ensure you maintain this positive momentum and counteract any potential anxiety?

User: I could set small goals for myself, like participating in at least one discussion per class. Also, I might reach out to someone new to make connections and practice interacting more frequently.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Setting small, achievable goals can really help in building your confidence gradually. How do you feel about creating a specific plan to implement these goals? For instance, we can outline what steps you might take in your next class.

User: That would be very helpful! I think I can decide to introduce myself to someone new and ask them about their study habits. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Connecting over study habits can be a natural conversation starter. Do you have any concerns about this plan that we can address now?

User: I’m still a bit worried about how they’ll respond. What if they don’t want to talk?

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have such concerns. However, if that situation arises, remember that it may not reflect on you personally; sometimes people are just preoccupied or shy themselves. What can you tell yourself to remain positive in that moment?

User: I can remind myself that it’s a normal part of socializing and that not every interaction will be perfect. Plus, I can always try again with someone else.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve developed a healthy perspective on this. As we get ready to wrap up our session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. We've acknowledged your progress, explored your fears, and created strategies to maintain your positive interactions. What do you feel is your main takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think my main takeaway is that I can use supportive self-talk and set small goals to keep moving forward. Also, it's okay to experience some fear; what matters is how I handle it.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve gained valuable insights today. Before we conclude, let's discuss how you can continue to apply these skills and what steps to take in case you face difficulties in the future.

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my progress to reflect on my growth and remind myself of my achievements. Having a support system in my class could also help.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! A journal can provide you with a tangible reminder of your progress, and reaching out to classmates can foster a supportive environment. As we finish today’s session, how do you feel about your progress and the plans we made? 

User: I feel more optimistic. Having these strategies makes me feel prepared for the upcoming classes. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made and the proactive steps you’re taking. Remember, you have the skills to manage and navigate these challenges. I'm here for you if you need assistance in the future. Good luck, and take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. See you next time!
