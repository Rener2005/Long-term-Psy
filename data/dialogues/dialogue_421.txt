Consultant: Hello, George! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling quite anxious. The conflict with my partner at work has been weighing heavily on my mind, and I can't shake the feeling of self-doubt.

Consultant: I can sense how challenging that situation has been for you. It sounds like the conflict has significantly impacted your feelings of self-worth. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in terms of self-doubt?

User: I just keep thinking that I should have handled the situation better. I feel like I've disappointed people, and it makes me question my abilities as a partner. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way after a conflict, especially in a professional setting. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you're feeling that self-doubt?

User: I often think things like, "I’m not good enough for this role," or "What if I mess up again?" It creates a cycle where I feel anxious to the point where I can’t concentrate on my work.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. Let's take a moment to examine them. How factual do you think statements like “I’m not good enough” really are? Is there evidence that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: I don’t know... Sometimes I have successes, but they don't seem to matter much to me right now. I just focus on the criticism.

Consultant: It's common for our minds to highlight the negatives, especially after a difficult experience. Let's try this: Imagine if a friend were in your shoes. What would you say to them if they expressed such self-critical thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes, and one conflict doesn’t define their worth. 

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows that you already have the ability to be compassionate toward others. How can you apply that same understanding to yourself in this situation?

User: I suppose I need to remind myself that I'm still capable and not defined by a single mistake. But it’s hard to really believe that.

Consultant: I completely understand. Let's work on developing a more balanced view of your abilities. Can we create a list of your accomplishments and strengths that you can revisit whenever those negative thoughts creep in?

User: That sounds helpful. I think writing it down will make it more tangible. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing can help solidify those positive affirmations. As you reflect on your accomplishments, which ones stand out to you that boost your confidence?

User: I managed a significant project last year that brought in new clients for the firm. That felt good.

Consultant: That’s an excellent achievement! It showcases your skills and contributions. Keeping that as a reminder can help counter those negative thoughts. When you start to doubt yourself, can you promise to reference that accomplishment?

User: Yes, I can do that. I guess focusing on what I've done well might help shift my mindset.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Let’s also consider how you can approach similar conflicts in the future. What are some communication strategies you might employ to manage conflicts more effectively?

User: Maybe I could practice calming techniques or have a clear structure for how to express my side during disagreements.

Consultant: Those are valuable approaches! Practicing calming techniques can definitely reduce anxiety in the moment. Would you like to role-play a scenario to help you prepare for future conversations?

User: Sure, that might help me feel more ready to confront these situations.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re having a discussion with your partner about the recent conflict. How would you start the conversation?

User: I guess I would start by stating my feelings honestly without being accusatory. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Expressing your feelings can pave the way for open dialogue. How might you phrase that to keep the discussion respectful?

User: I could say something like, "I felt really anxious during our meeting, and I think we may have misunderstood each other."

Consultant: Excellent start! That expresses your feelings while inviting clarification. How does practicing this make you feel about approaching potential future conflicts?

User: It does make me feel a bit more empowered. I think I can take this approach seriously.

Consultant: Empowerment is key! Remember, it's not about perfection but about progress. Now that we’ve discussed these strategies, let’s recap what you’d like to work on moving forward.

User: I want to focus on recognizing my strengths, practicing self-compassion, and preparing for constructive communication during conflicts.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals, George! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on how you’ll maintain these strategies. What can you do to reinforce these new habits?

User: I’ll try to keep a journal of my accomplishments and practice those communication techniques regularly.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I believe these efforts will help reduce your anxiety and boost your self-esteem. Remember, it's about taking small steps forward. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about addressing my challenges now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made significant progress today. If you feel overwhelmed again, remember that these techniques are tools you can use. You're not alone in this!

User: I appreciate that. I’ll definitely keep this in mind.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing today, George. I look forward to our next session to see how you've implemented these strategies! Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello George! It's great to see you today. I understand that you’ve been feeling anxious and that communicating with your partner has been challenging. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. It seems like every time I try to talk to my partner about work issues, we just end up not understanding each other. It's frustrating and makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, George. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when communication doesn’t go as planned. What kind of situations do you find most difficult when trying to communicate with your partner?

User: Mostly when I try to express my ideas or concerns, it feels like I stumble over my words. I end up feeling like I’m not being taken seriously, which makes me more anxious.

Consultant: I hear you, feeling unheard can be really distressing. It sounds like you want to feel more confident in expressing your thoughts. What would that confidence look like for you during those conversations?

User: I guess I would like to speak more clearly and not get as nervous. If I could just express myself without feeling that tight knot in my stomach, it would help a lot.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, George. Being able to express yourself clearly can significantly reduce that anxiety. Let’s explore what happens in these moments. Can you share a specific instance when you felt particularly anxious while communicating with your partner?

User: Sure, there was a meeting last week where I tried to bring up some concerns about our project timeline. I started to talk, but I felt my heart racing and my voice became shaky. I could tell they weren’t engaged, which only made my anxiety worse.

Consultant: I can imagine how difficult that must have been. It seems like the physical reaction to anxiety made it even harder to stay engaged in the conversation. What thoughts run through your mind when you notice this anxiety building before a conversation?

User: I often think that I’m going to make a fool of myself or that my partner will dismiss my ideas. These thoughts just spiral and make it hard to focus.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really create a cycle of anxiety, can’t they? Let’s take a moment to identify those thoughts clearly. Would you say they’re an example of cognitive distortions—like catastrophizing or jumping to conclusions?

User: Yes, I guess that’s accurate. I just leap to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: Recognizing that is an essential step, George. What do you think would happen if you challenged those thoughts? For example, if you asked yourself what evidence you have that your partner will dismiss you?

User: I suppose I don't have strong evidence. They might be distracted, but it doesn't mean they don’t value my input.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s use that realization to create some alternative thoughts. What is a more balanced way to think about those conversations?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that my partner may not understand initially, but that doesn’t mean they won’t appreciate my perspective once I explain it clearly.

Consultant: That’s a constructive thought! Let's practice how you might express that to your partner next time. Would you like to role-play a possible conversation with me?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I could use the practice!

Consultant: Great! Let’s set the scene. Imagine you're in the meeting with your partner. Start by introducing your topic, and I'll respond as your partner.

User: Okay. “I’ve been thinking about our project timeline, and I feel we might need to adjust some deadlines to meet our goals more effectively.” 

Consultant (as partner): “That sounds interesting, but we have deadlines set already. What makes you think we need to change them?”

User: “I understand that we have deadlines, but I believe that adjusting them could help us deliver a better quality product instead of rushing through.”

Consultant: Very good, George! You’re calmly asserting your thoughts. How does practicing this feel for you so far?

User: It feels reassuring to use this approach. I think if I keep practicing, I could feel more at ease.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building this practice will help you gain confidence over time. What are some small steps you can take this week to practice these communication strategies?

User: Maybe I can start by sharing my opinions in smaller team meetings or even with friends to get used to expressing myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, George! Gradual exposure will help you build your confidence. How do you feel about tackling this practice over the next week?

User: I’m feeling optimistic! I know it will take time, but I’m determined to get better at this.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s all about moving forward at your own pace. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve achieved together. How do you feel about your understanding of your communication anxieties now?

User: I feel like I have a clearer view of why I struggle. I’m learning to challenge my negative thoughts and I have some tangible strategies to practice.

Consultant: That’s excellent, George! It sounds like you’re making meaningful strides. Laid out some small next steps, and remember to be kind to yourself as you practice. What would be your key takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think it would be to challenge my negative thoughts and to practice expressing myself more confidently in various situations.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, you’re capable of this growth. I look forward to hearing about your experiences during our next session. Take care, and see you soon! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I'm feeling hopeful about my progress.
###################
Consultant: Hello, George! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've had some ups and downs. I still struggle with self-doubt, especially after that meeting where I felt I couldn't express my opinions well. I hope to work through this.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those feelings, especially after such experiences. Let's explore what happened in that meeting a bit more. Can you tell me about your thoughts during the meeting?

User: I remember feeling very anxious. I thought everyone would judge me if I said something wrong. It was like a voice in my head telling me I wasn't good enough.

Consultant: That’s a painful experience. It sounds like those thoughts created a lot of pressure for you. What feelings did those thoughts trigger during the meeting?

User: I felt embarrassed and frustrated with myself. I just wanted to shrink away.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way when we're under pressure. Let's take a step back. You mentioned feeling like you're not good enough. Can we identify if that thought has evidence supporting it?

User: Well, I suppose I don't have any concrete evidence. It's just a feeling I get, especially when I try to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization, George. Often, our feelings can lead to negative thoughts that aren't based on facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to be kinder to themselves and to give it another try.

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a good understanding of how compassion can help. Now, let’s try to challenge that negative thought. What if we replace “I am not good enough” with something more balanced? 

User: Perhaps “I am improving and learning from my experiences”?

Consultant: That's a wonderful alternative! Let's practice using that thought in situations where you feel anxious. How does that resonate with you?

User: It feels a bit better. I think it could help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Great to hear that! Now, let’s discuss how we can expose you to public speaking situations gradually. Can you think of a low-risk scenario where you could practice sharing your thoughts?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my ideas in a small team meeting instead of a large one.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Smaller settings can serve as great practice. What might help you feel prepared for that meeting?

User: I could write down my points in advance and practice them before the meeting.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Preparation can significantly reduce anxiety. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel more confident thinking about practicing beforehand. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As you prepare, remind yourself of the new thought we came up with. Let’s plan to discuss how that small meeting goes in our next session.

User: Yes, I look forward to it! 

Consultant: Fantastic! Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. What are the key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I learned to challenge my negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Also, I have a plan to practice speaking in a smaller meeting.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing and reframing your thoughts is a powerful tool. How will you maintain this progress until our next session?

User: I will keep reminding myself of my new thought and practice my speaking in smaller settings.

Consultant: That's a solid plan, George. It sounds like you’re feeling more encouraged about your abilities now. I'm proud of the steps you're taking.

User: Thank you! I feel like I'm making progress, and it feels good.

Consultant: You're welcome! It's been great to work together. Remember, this journey takes time, but you're definitely on the right track. Let’s continue building on this progress next time.

User: Absolutely! See you next time!

Consultant: See you, George! Take care until then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, George! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit more positive lately. Can you share more about how you've been doing since our last session?

User: Hello! Yes, I feel a bit encouraged by my recent progress. I managed to openly express my opinions about a project, and some colleagues actually supported me. That made me feel good, but I still sometimes struggle with self-doubt.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you felt supported when sharing your ideas! Those moments are important for building confidence. Can you tell me what it felt like when you received that support from your colleagues?

User: It felt validating, like I was actually contributing something meaningful. However, I still have this nagging voice in my head that questions whether I'm really capable or if they were just being polite.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those conflicting feelings, especially after a positive experience. What do you think that voice is telling you specifically? How does it affect your confidence moving forward?

User: It tells me that I might not be as competent as everyone thinks. Sometimes, it makes me hesitant to share more in the future, even though I want to.

Consultant: I see. That self-doubt can be very challenging. Let's try to dig deeper into those thoughts. When you think, "I might not be competent," what evidence do you have to support that thought? 

User: Honestly, I don't have any concrete evidence. It’s more of a feeling I've developed over time. Like, I've always been compared to others who seem more skilled.

Consultant: That’s a key insight, George. It seems like those comparisons can really influence how you see yourself. If you were to evaluate that thought critically, what are some positive evidence or experiences that contradict that feeling?

User: Well, I have received positive feedback before, especially during presentations. And my colleagues have complimented my ideas at various times. But I guess I just tend to dismiss those moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like there is evidence of your competence that you may not be acknowledging. What if you allowed yourself to focus on those instances instead of dismissing them? How might that shift your perspective?

User: I suppose it could help me feel more capable and less anxious about sharing my thoughts. It's just hard to break that habit of self-doubt.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can take time, but recognizing those moments of success is a great first step. Why don’t we work together on a plan to document these positive moments? It could help reinforce your self-esteem.

User: That sounds like a good idea. Writing it down might make it feel more real.

Consultant: Exactly! You could maybe start a journal to note your achievements, positive feedback, or even moments when you feel confident. How do you feel about starting that process?

User: I’m willing to give it a try. It would be nice to have something to refer to when those negative thoughts creep in.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! As you start this journaling, how about we set a goal to reflect on three positive experiences each week? This can really help in retraining your mind to focus on the good.

User: I can do that. That seems manageable. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also take a moment to think ahead. How would it feel for you to share your ideas in the next team meeting with this new strategy in mind?

User: I actually feel a bit excited. If I have those positive reminders, it might help quiet the self-doubt.

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in mindset! Embracing those positive reminders can truly make a difference. As we progress, it’s also important to recognize how you feel when you're in those social settings. How do you feel when you're interacting with colleagues now compared to before?

User: I feel a bit more comfortable. There's still a hint of anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be.

Consultant: That’s progress, George! It sounds like your comfort level is increasing. Let’s reinforce that. How can you celebrate those small victories, even if your anxiety is still present?

User: I think reflecting on my successes—like when I expressed my ideas—would help. Maybe I could even share them with a trusted colleague.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Sharing with someone you trust can create a supportive environment and further boost your confidence. How does that make you feel about your social interactions?

User: It makes me feel more optimistic. If I can build on the support I’ve received, it’ll encourage me to keep going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping that momentum going is important. Remember, every small step counts in reinforcing your abilities and overcoming doubt. How committed do you feel to maintain this momentum going forward?

User: I feel pretty committed. I really want to keep working on this.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! We'll keep building on these strategies in our future sessions. As we prepare to conclude today's discussion, what do you think is your most significant takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I have moments of success to reflect on, and documenting them can help me challenge my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, George. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s about gradually shifting your mindset. Looking forward to our next session, what strategies do you think you could use if self-doubt rears its head again?

User: I could refer to my journal and possibly talk to a colleague about it. That should help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are excellent strategies. You've shown great awareness, and I believe you can maintain this positive progression. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to working on these things.

Consultant: You're very welcome, George! I’m excited about the progress you’re making. Until next time, take care and keep building on those positive reflections!
###################
Consultant: Hello George! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I can feel my confidence in social situations improving, and my relationships with my colleagues have gotten better too. But, I still struggle with feelings of anxiety sometimes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear about the progress in your social interactions! It sounds like you're noticing some positive changes. Can you share more about those moments when you still feel anxious? What triggers those feelings for you?

User: Mostly, it's when I'm in larger meetings or networking events. I just worry that I’ll say something wrong or embarrass myself, even though I try to remind myself that people are supportive.

Consultant: That's a common thought, and it's understandable to worry about how you come across in those situations. Let's explore that moment when you start to feel anxious. What kind of thoughts typically run through your mind during those times?

User: I often think, “What if I mess up?” or “Everyone is judging me.” It sometimes leads me to just avoid speaking up, even if I have something to contribute.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are quite intense and might be affecting your confidence. What kind of feelings do those thoughts generate for you when they arise?

User: I feel really nervous and my heart races. It makes me want to shrink back and not participate, which just reinforces my worries.

Consultant: I can understand how overwhelming that must be. Let’s take a moment to examine those thoughts more closely. Do you think there’s any evidence that everyone is truly judging you in those moments?

User: Not really. I mean, most of my colleagues are friendly, and I know they’ve been supportive. It just feels like that in the moment.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, George. What if we tried to challenge that thought a bit? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about facing similar feelings?

User: I guess I would tell them not to worry so much and that people are more understanding than they think.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a kind perspective on how others might feel. How can we start to apply that same kindness to yourself in those situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of that before entering a meeting. It could help to acknowledge my achievements too, rather than just focusing on the fear.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Acknowledging your past successes can build a foundation for a more positive mindset. What kind of achievements would you remind yourself of before these situations?

User: I’ve been leading some projects successfully and my feedback from colleagues has been uplifting. I guess I should focus on that instead of the fear.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's practice that. Can you think of a recent success story you would share with yourself to boost your confidence before a meeting?

User: I recently coordinated a successful team presentation. People seemed to appreciate my ideas, and I felt good afterwards.

Consultant: That's wonderful, George! Holding onto that feeling can provide you with confidence. How do you think you could incorporate that success into your pre-meeting routine?

User: Maybe I should visualize that presentation and remind myself how I felt afterward. It could help me stay positive.

Consultant: Visualization is a powerful tool! It can set a positive tone before you step into those situations. How can you make sure to practice that visualization regularly?

User: I could set a reminder on my phone or write it down in my planner as part of my meeting prep.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! By creating reminders, you’ll encourage yourself to reflect on that positive experience regularly. How do you feel about these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! It’s nice to have tangible actions to work on rather than just feeling anxious about it.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! As we continue our sessions, we can integrate these strategies and even explore more social skills practices. How are you feeling about that?

User: It sounds good! I'd like to work on this consistently and build my confidence even further.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, George! We'll create opportunities for practice in our next sessions. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps, and we’ll celebrate each one. As we wind down today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s the idea of challenging my negative thoughts and actively focusing on my successes before facing a stressful situation.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful insight. Let's keep building on that. In our next session, let’s discuss how those new strategies have worked for you. And don’t forget to take a moment to celebrate your progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support, and I’ll make it a point to reflect on my successes.

Consultant: You're welcome, George! I'm glad to be here for you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, George! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, actually. The communication with my partners has improved, and overall, I feel more engaged at work. It’s nice to see some positive changes.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like the changes in communication have had a beneficial impact on your well-being. Can you reflect a bit on what specifically has contributed to these positive feelings?

User: I think being appreciated by my partners has made a big difference. I feel more validated, and it’s easier to share my ideas now.

Consultant: It's great that you feel valued and that it has encouraged you to express your thoughts. How does this acknowledgment affect your self-esteem and self-doubt compared to before?

User: I feel a bit more confident. While I still have some self-doubt, it’s not as overwhelming as it used to be. I guess the positive feedback is helping me see myself in a better light.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to hear that you’re developing more confidence. So, let’s explore this further. When you think about your self-doubt, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: Sometimes I think I'm not good enough, especially when I compare myself to others. But now, I try to remind myself of the positive feedback I've received.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those comparative thoughts, but it’s wonderful that you’re also trying to combat them with the positive feedback. What are some strategies you’ve found effective in managing those self-doubts?

User: I’ve started keeping a journal where I jot down positive feedback and accomplishments. It helps me recall my strengths when I'm feeling low.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive strategy. Journaling can be a powerful tool for maintaining perspective. Reflecting on your strengths could further reinforce your sense of self-worth. Have you noticed any changes in your daily life as you implement this practice?

User: Yes, I feel more motivated to tackle tasks. When I read my journal, it boosts my mood and encourages me to take on challenges instead of avoiding them.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing your accomplishments can be a real motivator. As we think about your future goals for continued self-improvement, what areas would you like to focus on next?

User: I want to work on becoming better at handling criticism and not letting it affect my mood as much. I believe that would help my confidence even further.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal! Handling criticism constructively can enhance your resilience. What are some ways you think you could practice this skill in your daily life?

User: I could remind myself that feedback is about improvement, not a personal attack. Maybe I could even seek feedback regularly to get used to it.

Consultant: Seeking feedback regularly is a great idea, and viewing it as a tool for growth rather than criticism shows maturity. Would you like to set up a specific plan for how to practice this?

User: Sure! Maybe I could ask for feedback after presentations or projects. I can also practice responding positively to criticism when it arises.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan. It puts you in a proactive position to face potential challenges. Let’s review how you might hold yourself accountable for this practice over the next few weeks. How do you plan to follow through?

User: I can set reminders for myself to ask for feedback and to reflect on my responses afterward. I think discussing it with someone might also help.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach. Discussing your experiences with someone can provide additional support and insights. Is there someone in your circle you feel comfortable sharing your journey with?

User: Yes, I have a close friend who understands my situation well. I think I’ll share my feedback strategy with him.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive plan! Sharing your goals can enhance your accountability and strengthen your commitment. As we look forward to the future, are there any additional skills or strategies you’d like to develop alongside handling criticism?

User: I’d like to improve my time management as well. Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed with my workload.

Consultant: Improving time management can certainly ease feelings of overwhelm. What specific strategies or tools have you considered to help manage your time better?

User: I’ve thought about using a planner or maybe apps that help create to-do lists. I need to prioritize tasks better.

Consultant: Utilizing planners or apps is a great way to increase organization. Prioritizing tasks can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. How would you feel about setting some short-term goals for your time management as well?

User: That sounds good! I could set a goal to prioritize my tasks daily and review my progress weekly to see what works and what doesn’t.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach. Weekly reviews can help adjust your strategies in real-time. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize the key steps you plan to take moving forward.

User: I’ll focus on managing feedback, implementing my time management strategies, and maintaining my journal. I feel optimistic about these changes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, George! You’ve made significant progress. Remember, building on your success takes time and patience. If you ever feel discouraged, recall the strategies you’ve developed and the positive feedback you’ve received.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help throughout this process. 

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure, George! You’ve done excellent work during our sessions. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support again in the future. Take care!
