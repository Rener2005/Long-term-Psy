Consultant: Hello, Linlin! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to create a safe space for you to share your feelings. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down. The "love letter" incident at school still bothers me. I can't shake off the feelings of humiliation and anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like that incident had a significant impact on you. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling since then?

User: I feel ashamed and quite anxious about going to school. I try to avoid drawing attention to myself, and it's hard to concentrate in class. 

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. It's understandable to want to hide when you feel pressured. Have there been specific moments at school that have triggered those feelings?

User: Well, whenever I walk into class, I feel like everyone is watching me. Sometimes, I even hear whispers, and it makes my heart race. 

Consultant: That sounds incredibly stressful, Linlin. It seems like the fear of being judged is weighing heavily on you. What thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I keep thinking that they’re all laughing at me and that I’m just this ugly, silly girl. It feels like I can't escape that image. 

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite harsh. Let’s try to examine them. How much evidence do you have to support that everyone sees you that way? 

User: I guess I don’t have solid proof... but it feels so real. And the way some classmates talk to me makes me think I really am that way. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to perceive things that way, especially after what happened. But remember, our emotions can sometimes distort reality. How would you feel if a friend had the same experience and thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them they’re being too hard on themselves and that they shouldn’t let others’s opinions define them.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective when it comes to helping others. Maybe we can apply that same kindness to yourself. What would it look like if you viewed yourself through that lens?

User: I suppose I’d see that I’m not defined by those comments. I have things I’m good at; I should focus on those instead. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on your strengths can be empowering. What positive qualities or achievements can you remind yourself of during these tough times?

User: I’m good at drawing and I try hard in my studies, even if my grades aren’t the best.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Linlin! Let’s think about how we can use those strengths. Would setting small goals for your drawing or studies help you regain some positivity?

User: It might. Sometimes, I feel like I just want to give up, but I really enjoy drawing. Maybe I could set time aside for it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can help lift your mood. How about creating a specific time each week dedicated to drawing? 

User: Yes, I could definitely try that. It feels nice just thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Additionally, how do you feel about speaking up about your feelings with someone at school, perhaps a teacher or a trusted friend?

User: I'm not sure. I feel like they might not understand, or they'll find it silly.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel hesitant. But sometimes sharing our feelings can lead to support from unexpected places. What would be your concern about opening up?

User: I guess I worry they won’t take me seriously and that I’ll just feel more embarrassed. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but true friends and supportive adults usually care. Is there a specific person you feel a bit more comfortable talking to? 

User: Maybe my art teacher. She always seems to care about her students.

Consultant: That's a great choice! If you decide to share your feelings with her, you could also talk about your love for art. It might help you bond over something positive. 

User: That makes sense. I think I might give it a try.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for considering that! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned about yourself. What stands out to you from our conversation?

User: I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself and focus on the positive aspects of who I am. Maybe I can also reach out for support when I need it.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve shown great resilience and insight today. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling, but you also have the power to shift your perspective. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter talking about all this. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Linlin. Remember, you are not alone in this journey. If you ever need to talk more, I’m here for you.

Consultant: Hello, Linlin! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit mixed, actually. The whole situation with the love letter really threw me off, but I'm starting to notice that some classmates are being nicer to me. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of negative emotions from the situation but also noticing some positive changes around you. That's a good insight. Can you tell me more about how these changes have affected you?

User: Well, it's nice to feel a bit of sympathy from my classmates. I guess I just wish I could figure out how to interact with them better. Sometimes it still feels awkward. 

Consultant: I understand. It's great that you're feeling some support, but it's completely normal to feel awkward about social interactions, especially after a challenging event. What kind of interactions do you hope to improve?

User: I just want to be able to talk to them without feeling nervous. I want to feel like I can be a part of the group without worrying about what they'll think of me.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal, Linlin. Feeling nervous in social situations is something many people experience. Let's explore some strategies that could help you engage with your classmates more comfortably. Do you have any specific situations in mind where you'd like to improve your interactions?

User: Maybe when we have group work or discussions in class. I panic a bit when I have to share my thoughts.

Consultant: That makes sense, group work can be daunting. It might help to practice how to express your ideas confidently. Have you considered what specific thoughts run through your mind in those moments?

User: I often worry that I’ll say something silly or that they’ll laugh at me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite common, but they can also be very limiting. Let’s challenge that thinking. What evidence do you have that they would laugh at you? 

User: Well, I guess I don’t have solid proof. It’s just a fear.

Consultant: It’s good that you recognize it as a fear and not a certainty. If a friend were in your situation, how might you advise them to think about it?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to sound silly sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone has moments where they don’t feel perfect, and it’s a part of learning. Understanding that could help you feel more at ease. Let’s try a small exercise. How about we role-play a scenario where you share an idea with your classmates? 

User: That sounds interesting! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re presenting an idea in class. What’s something you might want to say? 

User: I might suggest a topic for our project, like recycling in school.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s practice what you might say. How would you start that?

User: I would say, “I think we should consider doing our project on recycling because it’s important for our school and the environment.”

Consultant: That’s a solid start! You’ve already framed it as an important issue. How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: I guess I feel a bit more confident. 

Consultant: With practice, that confidence can grow! Let’s think about some specific group work topics you could prepare for so you feel ready next time. 

User: Maybe I could prepare a few points on environmental issues or something interesting related to our studies.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Having prepared points can really help ease anxiety. Besides preparation, think about how you can observe the reactions of your classmates. Are there supportive individuals you can lean on during these interactions? 

User: I noticed a few classmates that seem friendly. Maybe I could connect with them.

Consultant: Fantastic! Building those connections can help create a supportive environment for you. You could even ask one of them to brainstorm with you before class. 

User: That would help! It would be nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: Definitely! Friendships are important for support. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve started to notice more positive interactions, identified areas for growth, and outlined ways to practice expressing yourself. 

User: Yes, I see how I can prepare and reach out to others. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue to work together, remember to keep reflecting on these positive changes. How do you feel about what we talked about today?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to think I can improve my interactions.

Consultant: That's wonderful, Linlin! Sometimes taking small steps can lead to great changes. For our next session, think about any interactions you have and how they went. I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experiences!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll do that. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you. Take care until we meet again!

User: I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Linlin! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with your friend from the other class?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better, actually. Talking to my friend has really helped me open up more about what I'm feeling. It’s nice to have someone to share my thoughts with.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Building that friendship sounds very valuable for you. Can you tell me about some of the things you've shared with your friend?

User: I told her about the teasing from classmates and how I feel about my appearance and grades. She listened and said everyone has their own struggles too, which made me feel less alone.

Consultant: It sounds like your friend provided a lot of support. How did sharing your feelings with her affect your view on those struggles?

User: It made me realize that maybe what I'm going through isn't so unique. I still feel bad about my grades and my skin, but I don’t feel as isolated anymore.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Linlin. Connecting with someone can show us that we’re not alone in our experiences. How do you feel about your academic challenges now?

User: I still feel worried about my grades, but now I want to talk to my teachers for help. I think that might help me improve a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Reaching out for help is a great strategy. What do you think might be the most challenging part of talking to your teachers?

User: I think I might feel anxious about approaching them. I worry they might judge me or think I'm not trying hard enough.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Let’s explore that thought. What evidence do you have that they might judge you?

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have any specific evidence. It’s just what I fear.

Consultant: That's an important recognition, Linlin. It seems like these fears might be based on assumptions rather than facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that teachers are there to help and that they shouldn't be afraid to ask questions.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate viewpoint when thinking about others. Can we try to apply that same perspective to your situation? 

User: Yes, I think so. I suppose I should give my teachers a chance and see how they respond.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Now, besides talking to your teachers, what other actions can you take to stay motivated to improve your grades?

User: I could set smaller goals for myself. Like studying a bit every day instead of cramming at the last minute.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Smaller goals can make studying feel much more manageable. How do you feel about setting a specific study goal for this week?

User: Maybe I can aim to study for an hour every day, focusing on subjects I find hard.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable, Linlin! How do you think you will check in with yourself about these goals throughout the week?

User: I guess I could keep a journal to note how much I study each day and how I felt about it.

Consultant: Great plan! Journaling can help you reflect on your progress and feelings. As you work on these goals, how will you maintain that positive self-recognition we talked about?

User: I think I will remind myself that improvement takes time and celebrate small wins, like completing my study session each day.

Consultant: I love that approach! Recognizing your progress, no matter how small, is essential. As we wrap up today’s session, what is one key takeaway you want to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to ask for help and that I can change my mindset about difficult situations.

Consultant: That’s an empowering takeaway, Linlin! You’re making great strides in understanding yourself and your relationships. Remember, it's perfectly fine to reach out whenever you need support. I believe you have the tools to continue growing. Would you like to set up our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're welcome, Linlin! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hi Linlin! It's great to see you again. I want to start today’s session by hearing a bit about how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better actually. My exam scores have improved, and my mom even praised me at home. It feels good to see the results of my hard work, but I still have some worries, especially about the upcoming high school entrance exam.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your improvement and your mom’s support! It sounds like you’re experiencing a mix of positive feelings from your achievements and some anxiety about the future. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you regarding the entrance exam?

User: I worry that even though I’ve done better recently, I might not do well on the actual exam. What if I can’t handle the pressure or forget everything I studied? 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about a big exam like that. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure for you to perform well. Let's talk about these thoughts. When you think about the exam, what specific thoughts come to your mind that make you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I might fail and let everyone down. Sometimes I think to myself that maybe I'm not smart enough to pass.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It seems like you’re holding onto some beliefs about your intelligence and your ability to succeed. Let’s explore that a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might not be smart enough for this exam?

User: I’ve struggled in the past, you know? My grades were never that great, and my friends often joke about how slow I am at studying.

Consultant: I can see how that would affect your confidence. However, it’s important to recognize your progress. You've worked hard and improved your scores recently. Since you’ve achieved better results, isn’t there a possibility that you’re more capable than you think?

User: I guess that’s true. My recent improvements are real. It just seems hard to keep believing that when I feel so anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely, that anxiety can overshadow your achievements. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts together. If you were to encourage a friend who felt this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their hard work and not let the past define them. Everyone has ups and downs, right?

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, let’s apply that to your situation. What if you viewed your past struggles as part of your learning process instead of a definition of your worth? 

User: I think that might help. It’s just hard to see it that way sometimes.

Consultant: It can be challenging to shift that perspective, but it’s a healthy way to approach your studies. What are some affirmations or positive statements you could use to remind yourself of your abilities?

User: Maybe something like, “I am capable of learning and improving,” or “I have worked hard and deserve to succeed.”

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Let’s practice using those whenever you feel anxious. How about setting a small goal each day to remind yourself of your progress with these positive statements?

User: That sounds doable. I could write them down and read them each morning before school.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Consistency in these reminders can help reinforce your positive self-image. How do you feel about combining those affirmations with a small reward every time you complete your study goals?

User: I like that idea! It would make studying feel more rewarding. Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy after a good study session.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Creating a reward system can increase your motivation. Which subjects do you feel most confident about, and how could you capitalize on that confidence for your test preparation?

User: I feel pretty good about math now, especially after my last test. I think I could focus on that and maybe help others in my class too.

Consultant: Helping others is a fantastic way to reinforce your own knowledge! It could also boost your confidence further. How can you incorporate that into your study routine?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time after school to tutor a few classmates who struggle. It might help us all.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant plan! Sharing what you know with others can highlight your strengths while also building community support. As we prepare for the exam, how do you want to manage any potential stress from studying and testing?

User: I think I’ll try to stick to a schedule and take breaks. I don’t want to overwhelm myself.

Consultant: Creating a balanced schedule is a wise approach. Remember to prioritize self-care during this time. What activities help you relax when you feel particularly stressed?

User: I like listening to music or going for a walk. Those help me calm down.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent coping strategies. Let’s make sure you include some time for those activities in your study schedule. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the strategies we talked about and your outlook on the upcoming exam?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I like the idea of using affirmations and rewards. It makes it seem less daunting.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made significant progress today. Remember, you’re capable of managing both your studies and your anxiety. Just take it one step at a time. If you ever need support, I’m here to help. Good luck, Linlin, and let’s keep building on this positive momentum in our next session!

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it.
###################
Consultant: Hello Linlin! I'm glad to see you here today. How are you feeling about your upcoming exams?

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit nervous, but also excited about the exams. I really want to do well, but I find it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I think about how much I have to study.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of nerves and excitement before exams. You mentioned having trouble concentrating; can you tell me more about what that feels like for you?

User: I just sit at my desk and feel overwhelmed. It’s like my mind goes blank, and I keep thinking about all the things I need to do instead of actually studying.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. When your mind goes blank, what kind of thoughts run through your head? Do you find yourself thinking negatively about your abilities?

User: Yes, exactly! I often think that I won't be able to remember anything or that I will fail. It really adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts make the studying process even more challenging for you. What if we try to identify some of these negative thoughts? Can you share a specific thought you had about your studying recently?

User: I remember thinking that everyone else will do better than me, and I’ll just be the one who fails. That makes it really hard to focus.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Linlin. It’s tough when you compare yourself to others. Let’s question that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that everyone else will do better? 

User: Well, my grades aren’t as good as some of my classmates’. But I guess it's not like I've done poorly in everything. 

Consultant: That’s an important point. You have done well in some subjects. If you were to give yourself a bit more credit, how would you frame that thought differently? 

User: Maybe I could think that if I study hard, I have a good chance of doing well too, just like my classmates.

Consultant: That's a fantastic shift in perspective! Focusing on your effort can help reduce that anxiety. Let's explore some practical steps you can take to tackle your study sessions. What activities might help you feel more organized and focused?

User: I think creating a study plan could help. Maybe breaking down what I need to review into smaller pieces?

Consultant: Absolutely, breaking your study session into manageable sections is a great strategy! How about we outline a simple study plan together? 

User: Yes, I’d like that! I think it could help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by identifying which subjects you want to focus on first. Could you list them for me?

User: I need to review math, Chinese, and English.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s allocate specific times for each subject. How many days do you have left until your exam?

User: I have about two weeks before my exam.

Consultant: That gives us some time! How about dedicating certain days to each subject? What do you think about studying math on Mondays and Wednesdays?

User: That sounds good!

Consultant: Wonderful! We can assign similar days for Chinese and English as well. Let’s also plan short breaks in between to help refresh your mind. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes! I think breaks would really help so I don’t get too overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Also, have you considered using positive affirmations during your study time? They could further boost your confidence.

User: I haven’t really thought about affirmations before. What kind should I use?

Consultant: You could use simple phrases like, "I am capable of learning this material," or "With each study session, I’m getting closer to my goals." How does that resonate with you? 

User: That feels encouraging! I think I could try saying those to myself while I study.

Consultant: That's a great approach, Linlin. Incorporating those phrases can help reinforce your self-belief. Now, let’s practice a relaxation technique to effectively manage those anxious moments. Have you tried any breathing exercises before?

User: No, I haven’t. I’m not sure how to do that.

Consultant: No worries! We can do this together. Let’s try a simple deep breathing exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale through your mouth for four. Let’s do it together.

User: *Breathes deeply* Okay, I feel a bit calmer already.

Consultant: Wonderful! Practicing this technique regularly can really help you manage anxiety. You can use it before studying or even during your exams. How does that feel?

User: I think it could really help me stay calm during the test!

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! As we wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned and how you can apply it moving forward.

User: I’ve learned to reframe my thoughts and create a study plan. The breathing exercise is really helpful too.

Consultant: Great insights! How confident do you feel now about facing your exams?

User: I feel much more confident! I think I can handle it better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Linlin! I believe in your ability to tackle this challenge. Remember, you are capable of more than you think. If you need to talk again in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Best of luck, and take care.
