Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I’m glad you’re here today. Let's talk about how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with starting school. How have things been for you?

User: Hi! I don’t like school very much. It’s noisy, and I don’t know how to play with the other kids. They don’t really talk to me, and I feel sad and angry.

Consultant: I understand that starting school can be tough, especially when everything feels new and challenging. Feeling sad and angry is completely okay. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel angry during school?

User: When kids don't play with me or when the teacher tells me to do things I don’t understand, I just want to shout!

Consultant: It sounds like you feel really frustrated when things don’t go your way. That’s a normal feeling, but I wonder—when you feel like shouting, what do you think would happen if you tried saying how you feel instead?

User: I don’t know… Maybe they will laugh at me or not care.

Consultant: That’s a really understandable worry, Xiaoli. Sometimes it feels scary to say what we’re feeling. But what if we practiced together? We could come up with some phrases that let your friends and teacher know how you feel. Would you like to try that?

User: I guess I could try. But what should I say?

Consultant: How about starting with something simple like, “I feel sad when nobody plays with me”? It tells them how you feel without getting too angry. What do you think?

User: I think that could work, but what if they don’t listen?

Consultant: That’s a good question. Sometimes, people might not understand right away. But if you keep trying to share your feelings, they may eventually notice. And remember, sharing how you feel is a brave thing to do! Would you like to practice saying that out loud?

User: Okay, I’ll try… “I feel sad when nobody plays with me.” 

Consultant: That was great! How did it feel to say that?

User: It feels a bit silly, but also okay. 

Consultant: That’s a good start! It’s normal to feel a little silly when we try something new. What if we also think about what you can do when you feel angry? Like when something happens that makes you want to shout, what could you do instead?

User: Maybe… I could count to ten or take deep breaths?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Xiaoli! Counting to ten or taking deep breaths can help you calm down. When you practice that, you might feel more in control of your feelings. Can we practice taking a deep breath together?

User: Sure! *takes a deep breath* 

Consultant: Great job! Now, tell me, when you feel calm after breathing, what will you say or do next time at school?

User: I can say how I feel and maybe even try to play with the other kids.

Consultant: I love that idea! Trying to play with others is a wonderful way to express yourself. When you feel comfortable, you can invite someone to play a game. What game do you think you could suggest?

User: Maybe… tag? I like running!

Consultant: Tag sounds like so much fun! Running can be a great way to connect with others and express joy. How does the thought of asking someone to play tag make you feel?

User: It makes me a little nervous but also excited!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mix of feelings! Feeling nervous is completely normal, but the excitement is a sign that you really want to connect with others. Remember, it’s okay to be nervous. What will you do if you feel that nervousness cropping up when you ask someone to play?

User: I can breathe and count again.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breaths and counting will help a lot. You’re building some strong skills here! As we continue, remember, the goal is to feel more comfortable with your feelings and how to share them. How do you feel about what we’ve worked on today?

User: I feel a little better. I think I can try when I go back to school.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear, Xiaoli! Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. How about for next time we meet, you can share how it went when you tried these strategies at school?

User: Okay, I’ll tell you how it goes!

Consultant: I look forward to that! You’re doing so well in learning to express and manage your feelings. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. Until next time!

User: Thank you! Bye!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I'm really upset. I don’t understand why the teacher gets mad at me, and I don't know how to handle it when my classmates whisper about me. I just want to cry or hit something.

Consultant: I see that you're feeling quite angry and frustrated, especially with how your teacher and classmates treat you. It’s okay to feel that way. Can you tell me what happened that made you feel this way?

User: The teacher said I was too noisy in class and that I should pay attention. I didn't mean to be noisy, but I felt like they were all looking at me. It made me really mad!

Consultant: It sounds like the teacher's comment really affected you. When that happens, it's normal to feel angry, but it's important to find other ways to express those feelings. What do you think you would like to do when you feel this way?

User: I don’t know. I want to hit someone or just cry. But I feel alone, and no one understands.

Consultant: Feeling alone can be very difficult. It might help to think about other ways to express your feelings without hurting yourself or others. Can we explore some different ways to respond when you’re feeling like this?

User: Maybe? I just always feel overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to stop.

Consultant: Overwhelm can be really tough. Let’s try to break it down together. When you feel overwhelmed, what kinds of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I think everyone hates me and that I can’t do anything right.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging. Let’s challenge that for a moment—do you think everyone actually hates you, or could it be that they just don’t understand how you feel?

User: Maybe they don’t understand… but it still feels bad.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel hurt. It’s important to recognize that feelings are real, even if they might not reflect the whole picture. What if we write down some positive things about yourself, to remind you of your strengths?

User: Okay. I like playing soccer, and I’m faster than most of my friends! 

Consultant: Great! That’s an excellent start! You're good at soccer, and that’s something to be proud of. Can we think of other things, maybe how you interact with your friends or something good that happened at school?

User: Sometimes I help my friends with their homework, and they say thank you.

Consultant: Helping your friends is truly a wonderful quality. You bring valuable things to your relationships! When you hear negative comments, try to remind yourself of these positive aspects. How might this help you when you feel criticized?

User: I guess I could think about the good things instead of just the bad ones.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus can help change how you feel. Now, if you find yourself in class and feel frustrated again, what could you say or do instead of crying or getting angry?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and remember that I can ask for help if I need to?

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Taking a moment to breathe can create space for you to respond calmly. If you ask for help when you need it, how do you think your classmates or the teacher might react?

User: They might help me, and then I wouldn’t feel alone.

Consultant: Yes, that's a possibility! Reaching out can connect you to others instead of feeling isolated. Let’s practice how you could ask for help from a friend or the teacher next time you feel overwhelmed.

User: Okay. What should I say?

Consultant: You could start with something like, “I’m feeling a bit upset right now. Can I talk to you?” It opens up an opportunity for support. Would you like to try saying that?

User: Sure! “I’m feeling a bit upset right now. Can I talk to you?”

Consultant: Beautiful! That sounds great. Remember, expressing how you feel is a strong step in building connections. How do you feel about trying this in class next time?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also a bit better. I think I can try it.

Consultant: That’s a courageous mindset! It’s okay to feel nervous; what matters is that you're willing to try a new approach. As we wrap up today, what do you think you’ve learned about expressing how you feel?

User: I learned that it’s okay to ask for help and that I can think of good things about myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are valuable insights. Always remember that you can reach out for help, and focusing on your strengths can help you handle the tough moments better. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel okay. I’m still upset, but maybe I can deal with it better now.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward, Xiao Li! Remember, it's okay to feel upset, and you have tools now to help you express yourself. I'm here whenever you need to talk again.
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been really angry and upset. Something happened at school with a classmate, and I ended up getting into a fight again. I just don't know how to handle my feelings!

Consultant: It sounds like that was really tough for you. You feel angry and upset about the situation with your classmate. Can you tell me more about what happened during that conflict?

User: Well, we were playing a game, and he wouldn't let me have my turn. I got really mad and pushed him because I felt it was unfair. I didn't mean to hurt him, but I just lost control.

Consultant: It seems like you felt that the situation was unfair, and that made you lose control of your emotions. It's okay to feel that way, but we can work together to find better ways to express those feelings. What were you thinking when you pushed him?

User: I thought it was so unfair that I couldn't play, and I felt like I had to show him that I was serious. I didn't want to be left out.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like you felt excluded and wanted to make sure you were heard. When you have those feelings, what other ways could you express your needs instead of pushing?

User: I guess I could try asking him nicely or maybe just wait for my turn. But sometimes I feel like no one listens to me.

Consultant: Asking nicely is a great idea, and it's important for your friends to hear you. It’s understandable to feel like no one is listening sometimes. What can we do together to help you feel more confident when you talk to your classmates?

User: Maybe we can practice what to say when I feel like I want to explode again. That could help!

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing what to say is a wonderful approach. Let's start by thinking about a situation where you might feel angry again. How would you like to express yourself in those moments?

User: I could say, "I want to play too!" instead of just getting mad. 

Consultant: That's a perfect statement! It's clear and direct. How do you think the other kids would respond if you said that?

User: Maybe they would understand and let me play. I hope so!

Consultant: I believe they would appreciate you expressing yourself calmly. Now let’s think about what to do when you start to feel that anger building up. What could you tell yourself to help calm down before reacting?

User: I could try saying "Take a deep breath" or "Wait a second". 

Consultant: Those are excellent self-reminders! Taking a deep breath can really help. Let's practice that together. In a moment of anger, can you visualize yourself taking a deep breath? 

User: Like this? *inhales deeply*

Consultant: Exactly! That’s it! How do you feel after taking that breath?

User: I feel a little better and less mad.

Consultant: That's great to hear! This is a good strategy to help manage your emotions. Let's also practice saying, "I feel upset when I can't play," so your classmates can understand your feelings better.

User: Okay, saying that might help them see why I'm upset.

Consultant: Yes! It gives them a chance to understand you. Let’s think about a time you could use this in class or during playtime. Can you imagine having a conversation with one of your classmates using what we practiced?

User: I can! If it happens again, I’ll try to talk to them first before getting angry.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, and it shows you're learning to control your emotions. Let’s talk about how you can keep using these strategies in different situations. Are there any events coming up where you’ll get to practice?

User: I have a playdate this weekend. I can use what I learned!

Consultant: Perfect! A playdate is a great opportunity. Remember to breathe and express your feelings clearly if something bothers you. What’s the biggest takeaway you have from our session today?

User: I learned I can talk instead of getting angry, and I can breathe to calm down.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m proud of you for actively working on this. Before we end, let's talk about how you can keep building these skills at home or with your family. 

User: I can tell my parents what I learned too! They can help me practice.

Consultant: Wonderful idea! Sharing your skills with your family can really support your progress. I'm excited to hear how your playdate goes next time. 

User: Thanks! I feel better that I have things to try now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's okay to feel your emotions, but you now have tools to help express them in healthier ways. We will continue to build on this next time. 

User: Bye! I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Bye! I'm looking forward to it too. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support before then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm really happy to see you today. I heard you've been doing a great job expressing yourself at family gatherings. Can you share how that made you feel?

User: Hi! I felt really happy because I could tell my cousins what I think. But sometimes, I still get upset when they don’t listen.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you felt happy about sharing your thoughts. It can be frustrating when others don’t pay attention, can’t it? How did you manage to stay calm when that happened?

User: I took a deep breath and tried to wait until they were done talking. But sometimes it's hard.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy, taking a deep breath helps in staying calm. Let’s play a little game with emotions. Can you tell me about a time when you felt happy during the gathering?

User: I was happy when we played games together. I laughed a lot, and I felt like a part of the group.

Consultant: Laughter is such a great way to connect with others! What do you think you can do to feel that happiness more often when you’re with your family or classmates?

User: Maybe I can suggest more games or tell them my favorite stories!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Sharing games and stories can help others feel included too. If you think of a story you'd like to share, how would it make you feel to start telling it?

User: I would feel excited. I want them to enjoy it like I do.

Consultant: That excitement is a wonderful feeling! Why don’t we practice together? Can you tell me just a little bit about your favorite story?

User: Sure! It's about a dragon who loves to play and help people. He's really funny!

Consultant: A funny dragon sounds amazing! What does he do to help people?

User: He helps them find their lost things and makes them laugh when they're sad.

Consultant: That’s very kind of him! How do you think sharing this story would help your family feel better when they're having a tough day?

User: Maybe they would laugh and feel happy again. 

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing positive stories can really lift everyone’s spirits. Now, how do you feel about using your voice to tell this story at your next family gathering?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited!

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous before sharing something. How can we turn that nervousness into excitement when you tell your story?

User: I can practice telling it first before the gathering, so I won't be so scared.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a great plan! It helps build your confidence. Is there another way you can remind yourself to enjoy telling your story?

User: I can think about how happy everyone was last time when I talked.

Consultant: That’s a perfect way to remember! Keeping those happy thoughts in your mind can make you feel more excited. What other aspects of telling stories do you find fun?

User: I like making funny voices for the characters!

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Adding funny voices makes the story more engaging. How about we think of a little practice routine for you to prepare for storytelling, including those funny voices?

User: Okay! I can practice each part of the story, live my funny voices in my room.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Practicing in your room can help you feel more comfortable. How can you also celebrate this progress after each practice session?

User: Maybe I can reward myself with a small treat or play afterwards!

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Celebrating your effort can motivate you to keep improving. What’s a small treat you enjoy?

User: I like candy!

Consultant: Perfect! After each practice, you can enjoy some candy to celebrate your bravery. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, it sounds really good!

Consultant: I’m so proud of you for thinking of these ideas, Xiaoli. Your excitement and creativity are shining through! As we wrap up today, what are you most looking forward to when you share your story?

User: I want to see everyone laughing and having fun!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! I believe you will bring a lot of joy to your family with your story. Remember, you have the skills to express your feelings and connect with others. Keep practicing and looking forward to those happy moments. 

User: Thank you! I feel a lot better now, and I can’t wait to practice!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoli! I’m excited for you, and I know you can do it. Keep me updated on how it goes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm really glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've been doing a great job recently. Can you tell me how you've been feeling about your social interactions since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've felt pretty good about sharing toys with my friends during the last family get-together. I was really happy to play and to be nice to everyone. It felt good.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like those social skills are really coming together for you. What specific moments during that gathering made you feel proud or happy?

User: Well, there was this time when I shared my favorite toy car with a kid who wanted to play with it. We had fun racing them together. I felt happy!

Consultant: Sharing your favorite toy and having fun together is a big achievement! It shows that you're building great friendships. How did it feel to share the toy with him? 

User: I felt a little nervous at first, but then I was just... excited! I liked seeing him smile. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous at the beginning, but it’s great that you were able to feel excited afterward. That’s a fantastic way to express friendship. How do you think you can keep sharing and playing nicely with your friends in the future?

User: I think I can ask my friends if they want to play with my toys more often. Maybe I can also invite them to my house to play. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Inviting friends over and being open to playing together can really strengthen those friendships. What do you think your parents would say about that plan?

User: I think they'd be happy! They like when I have friends over. They say it's good to play together.

Consultant: It sounds like your parents support your efforts, which is fantastic! Now, let’s think about how you can practice sharing not just at home, but also at school. How do you think that would look?

User: At school, I can share my art supplies! I can ask other kids to use them. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing art supplies can be a great way to connect with classmates. What kind of reactions do you think you might get when you offer to share?

User: I think they would be happy and want to be my friend. But sometimes, I worry they won't want to play with me.

Consultant: It's normal to have those worries sometimes. Let's explore that feeling a bit. What do you think might happen if they don't want to play with you?

User: I guess I might feel sad or upset, like before. But I hope it doesn’t happen!

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel sad. However, let's consider different possibilities. Maybe some kids might say "no" for different reasons that have nothing to do with you. How can you remind yourself of this if it does happen?

User: I can remember that not everyone likes the same things. I can keep trying!

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset, Xiaoli! Remembering that everyone is different and keeps trying is a strong way to approach friendship. How would you feel about trying this out in school next week?

User: I think I want to try! I’ll share my crayons with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Sharing your crayons is a wonderful opportunity. How can we make sure you feel prepared for that?

User: Maybe I can practice asking someone during art class.

Consultant: Practicing in art class sounds like a perfect idea! It’s a comfortable setting where you can feel more confident. How will you feel after you practice sharing in class?

User: I think I will feel proud because I tried! And even if it’s hard, I can still do it.

Consultant: Feeling proud of your efforts is so important! It’s a sign of your growth. Just remember, each step you take is helping you grow more confident. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today, or do you feel ready for this next step?

User: I feel ready! I’m excited to share and make friends.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It seems like you're really motivated to build those connections. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important thing you learned about yourself in our session?

User: I learned that I can share and be nice, even when I feel nervous. 

Consultant: That’s truly wonderful, Xiaoli! Recognizing your ability to share and still be kind, no matter how you feel, is such a big step. As we move forward, let’s keep building on this success. Remember, you're doing fantastic, and I'm here to support you! 

User: Thank you! I can’t wait to try!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited for you too. Just remember, it’s okay to feel nervous but also celebrate your efforts. Until next time, take care and keep sharing that kindness!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! It's great to see you again today. I'm excited to catch up on how you're doing in school and at home. What would you like to share with me about your progress since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. My teacher said I'm doing great in class discussions, and I even helped my classmates with their tasks. I feel more confident now!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiao Li! It sounds like your confidence has grown and you're really participating in class. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you're helping others or engaging in discussions?

User: When I'm helping others, I feel happy and proud. It’s nice to share ideas. But sometimes, I still get a bit frustrated if I can't express what I'm thinking clearly.

Consultant: I understand. It's completely normal to feel that way sometimes, especially when you have a lot of thoughts. What do you think helps you manage your frustration when it happens?

User: I try to take deep breaths or think about what I want to say before speaking. It helps a little, but if I’m really upset, I might still feel like crying.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful technique! It’s good to have strategies to calm yourself down. Let's explore more ways that could help you express your thoughts better. Are there any specific situations in class where you still find it difficult to express yourself?

User: Sometimes, when I have to talk in front of the whole class, I get nervous and forget what I wanted to say. I wish I could be as confident as I am in smaller groups.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous when speaking in front of many people. Would you be open to trying some techniques that might help you gain confidence, even in front of the whole class?

User: Yes, I would like that!

Consultant: Great! One technique we can try is to practice speaking in front of a mirror at home. You can rehearse what you want to say before going to class. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can do that! I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, practice can make a big difference! We can also set a goal for you to share at least one idea in front of the class each week. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds challenging but exciting! I want to try it.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiao Li! How about we also include a time for your parents and teacher to check in on your progress? This support could really help you stay motivated.

User: Yes! My parents are really supportive and my teacher is nice too.

Consultant: Having that support can make a huge difference. Let's encourage them to celebrate your efforts together. What would you like them to know about how you're feeling?

User: I want them to know I'm trying hard and I feel better when they encourage me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful message. Encouragement is very powerful. How about we discuss ways for you to express this with them, so they can help you even more?

User: I could tell them after I practice in front of the mirror! 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great idea. Sharing your plans with them can open up a dialogue about your needs and feelings. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel good! I’m excited to try the mirror practice and tell my parents.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's amazing to see your progress and how you're willing to try new things. Remember, it's all part of your growth journey. Do you think you’ll have any challenges with the plans we've set today?

User: Maybe I'll feel nervous again, but I think I can handle it better now.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but your strategies and support will help. Just take it one step at a time. We can also plan to check in next time about how the mirror practice is going, okay?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I want to share my progress.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to hearing about it. One last thing—what do you think has been your biggest achievement recently?

User: Helping my classmates! I feel like I really contributed.

Consultant: That’s a massive achievement, Xiao Li! Contributing to others is a sign of confidence and growth. Remember this feeling, as it shows you how capable you are. 

User: I will! Thank you for today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been great to see your growth. Keep practicing those techniques, and I can’t wait to hear about your experience next time. Take care!
