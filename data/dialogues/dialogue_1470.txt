Consultant: Hi, Xiaojun! I'm glad you came today. I understand you've been dealing with some intense emotions lately. Would you like to share what's been happening?

User: Hi. I've been really angry recently, especially at school. I had this situation where I lost my temper during a football game, and I ended up chasing a classmate. My parents were really upset, and I feel confused about why it keeps happening.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiaojun. It seems like those anger outbursts are causing a lot of stress for you and your family. Let’s try to figure out what’s triggering those feelings. Can you describe what was going through your mind during the football game when you felt so angry?

User: Well, I felt like my teammates weren’t passing the ball to me, and I thought they were ignoring me. I just got so frustrated and then I snapped.

Consultant: I see. So, it sounds like when you felt ignored, your frustration built up quickly. What emotions did you feel right before you started to chase your classmate?

User: I was really mad... and also kind of sad. It felt unfair. But in that moment, I just wanted to let it all out and didn’t think.

Consultant: That’s really insightful, Xiaojun. It seems like your anger is closely linked to feelings of sadness and unfairness. We can work on understanding those emotions better. How would you describe what happened after you chased your classmate? What were your thoughts?

User: After I calmed down, I felt guilty. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, but I just lost control. My parents yelled at me, and I felt really bad about myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel guilty after such an incident. Losing control can be alarming. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you think of any other situations recently where you felt this same kind of anger?

User: Yes, there was another time when my dad was really loud and I felt scared and upset. I wanted to respond but didn't know how. Instead, I took it out on my toys at home.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re connecting those feelings, Xiaojun. When your dad gets loud, it seems to trigger similar feelings of anger. Can you recall what thoughts went through your mind when you were reacting to your dad’s anger?

User: I just thought he was being unfair and that he didn’t care how I felt. It made me feel so small and upset, and I didn’t like it.

Consultant: Those feelings of being small and disregarded can be really overwhelming. Let’s think about alternative ways to respond when you start to feel those emotions. Are there any strategies you think might help when your anger starts to rise?

User: I don’t know…maybe I could try to walk away or talk to someone instead of reacting?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea, Xiaojun! Walking away or talking to someone can help you cool down before reacting. We could also consider some breathing techniques. What do you think about practicing that together?

User: Breathing sounds good. I’ve heard about it before but never tried it.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s practice some deep breathing techniques now. Think of it like this: when you inhale deeply, you feel your belly rise, and when you exhale, you can let go of the tension. Let's try it together. 

User: Okay, that sounds nice. *takes a deep breath* 

Consultant: Great job, Xiaojun. As you breathe, try to imagine that with each exhale, you’re letting go of your anger. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit calming. I like this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, practicing this can help you calm down during those tough moments. Let's also think about the next time you feel that anger building up. What can you say to yourself to check those feelings?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to be upset, but I don’t need to act out. I can be better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiaojun! Acknowledging your feelings and choosing a different response is a big step. Let’s keep practicing recognizing those emotions together. Do you think this is something you could try during the week?

User: Yes, I think I can try. It’ll be hard, but I want to work on it.

Consultant: It's completely understandable that it will be challenging. Remember, taking small steps is still progress. We’ll keep exploring and developing strategies together. Next time, we can review how it went. How are you feeling now about the situation with your dad and at school?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Maybe I can try these things and see if it helps.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Xiaojun! It’s all about progress. I’m proud of you for being proactive. Next session, let’s focus on how you felt during the week and see where we can build from there.

User: Okay, I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Me too! I'm here to support you. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings, and I'm glad we talked about these emotions today. You’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thanks! It really helps to talk about it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaojun. I’m glad to be here for you. I’ll see you next time—take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad you're here today. Last time we talked about your feelings of anger and your awareness of emotional management. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been trying to think more about my feelings, but sometimes it’s hard. I still get really angry, especially when my dad raises his voice. I feel confused and don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're trying to reflect on your feelings. It sounds like when your dad gets loud, it triggers a strong reaction in you. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I usually think that he's angry at me, and I feel like I can't do anything right. Then I just get really upset.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. When you think that your dad is angry at you, it makes sense that you would feel upset. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. Do you think it's possible that your dad's anger might not be directed at you personally?

User: I don’t know… sometimes it feels like it is. He gets upset about small things, and I worry if I’ll get in trouble.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when there’s tension. However, it might help to consider if his anger is about his own stress or frustrations, rather than a reflection of you. What do you think?

User: Maybe… but it's hard to remember that in the moment. I just feel hurt and want to yell back.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed in those moments. Have you tried any strategies to pause and think before reacting?

User: I haven’t really thought about pausing. I usually just react without thinking.

Consultant: That’s a common response, especially when emotions run high. Let's try a simple exercise. When you feel that anger build-up, imagine saying “pause” in your mind and take a deep breath. How does that sound?

User: I guess I could try that… but I’m not sure it will help.

Consultant: It's perfectly okay to feel unsure. The key is practice. How about we role-play a scenario where your dad raises his voice, and you practice saying “pause”? 

User: Okay, I can try that.

Consultant: Great! So, picture yourself in that situation. Your dad is upset about something small. What would your first instinct be?

User: I’d probably feel scared and want to shout back.

Consultant: Instead of shouting back, remember to say “pause” and take a breath. Can you do that for me in this scenario?

User: *pauses* Okay... *deep breath* I feel a little better already just thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s all about giving yourself that moment to breathe. Now, when you think of your dad being angry, what thoughts can you replace with the initial negative thoughts?

User: Maybe I can think, “He's just upset about something else.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a very positive shift in perspective. It can help reduce the intensity of your feelings. What do you feel now thinking about that?

User: I feel a bit less worried. It feels like I have some control over my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Remember, it may take time to fully implement this new approach, but each step counts. How do you feel about practicing this in the coming week?

User: I’ll definitely try! It’s kind of exciting to think I can try to change how I react.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Keep in mind that practice makes progress—it won’t happen overnight, but every attempt is valuable. We can also explore more ways to communicate with your family next time. How does that sound?

User: That would be really helpful! I want to talk to my mom too, but it’s hard to know what to say.

Consultant: Looking forward to it! It can be helpful to have a few phrases ready to express your feelings calmly. Together, we can work on that. Before we finish today, what’s one takeaway you'd like to remember from our session?

User: I think I’ll remember to say “pause” when I start feeling angry and take a breath. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Keep that in mind. I'm proud of you for trying this approach, Xiao Jun. You are making great strides in understanding your emotions. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need more support, know that it’s okay to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I feel better talking about this.

Consultant: You're most welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Until next time, just remember that you're not alone in this journey. Take care, and I’m looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi, Xiaojun! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to control my anger, but it’s still hard, especially with my dad being so strict since he came back. I feel like all the techniques I learned sometimes just don’t work.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with how you're managing your emotions at home, especially under pressure from your father. Can you tell me more about a specific moment when you felt your anger rise recently?

User: Well, last week we had a small disagreement about my homework. He got really angry and I just couldn't calm down. I felt like I was going to explode.

Consultant: That must have been really stressful! It’s understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed. When those feelings come up, what thoughts run through your mind at that moment?

User: I just feel like he doesn't understand me at all. It's like he thinks I don't care about my studies, but I really do. 

Consultant: It sounds like you feel misunderstood. It can be really tough when we think others don't see our efforts. Have you noticed how these thoughts make you feel physically when you're angry?

User: Yeah, my heart races, and I feel hot. I sometimes feel like I just want to shout.

Consultant: Those physical symptoms can be really intense. Let's work on some breathing techniques that might help you when you start feeling that way. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise with me?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try.

Consultant: Great! Let's begin by taking a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a moment, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Let's do that three times together. Ready? Inhale… hold… and exhale. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a little bit lighter, but I’m not sure it will help when I’m really angry.

Consultant: That's totally okay! It’s a practice. It might take some time to feel the effects during those angry moments. You can also complement this with mindfulness techniques, like focusing on your breath when you start feeling overwhelmed. Does that sound like something you could try?

User: Yes, I think I can try that. But what if I still feel angry?

Consultant: If you still feel angry, that’s completely normal. It's about noticing it without judgment. You could also try to express your feelings calmly to your dad. Can you think of a way to share how you feel with him during a calm moment?

User: I guess I could tell him that I feel stressed about school and that I really want to do well but need some understanding from him.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great start. By expressing your feelings like that, you’re opening the door for better communication. Would it help if we practiced how to say that?

User: Yeah, let’s practice!

Consultant: Okay! Imagine your dad is sitting with you. You might start by saying, “Dad, I really care about my studies and sometimes I feel a lot of pressure.” How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: I feel nervous but also relieved that I can say something.

Consultant: That’s a huge step! It takes courage to express oneself. Remember that it’s a process, and the more you practice, the easier it will get. What do you think you could do next time you feel upset instead of shouting?

User: I could try that breathing exercise or maybe say what I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! Both of those options are excellent. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about managing your emotions and communicating with your dad. How do you feel about what you’ll implement this week?

User: I feel more hopeful! I have some tools to use, and I think I can talk to my dad better now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about practice and patience. When you face competition or difficult situations, keep using those strategies we talked about. You are doing amazing work here, Xiaojun. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I can handle things better now.

Consultant: You really can! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. If you find it challenging again, just remember that you have the skills to manage your feelings. We can review everything in our next session. 

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: Great! Have a wonderful week, Xiaojun. Remember to be kind to yourself as you practice these new skills. 

User: Thank you! I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to manage my emotions better. I feel improved in some situations, especially when participating in class activities, but I still sometimes get angry quickly, especially during competitions.

Consultant: It's great to hear you've made progress in being more active in class! Experiencing fast anger in competitive situations can be challenging. Can you tell me more about what happens during those moments when you feel that anger rising?

User: Well, when I feel like I'm losing or not performing well, I just can't help but feel really frustrated. It feels like everything is unfair, and then I get angry, which makes it even harder to focus.

Consultant: That sounds quite tough, Xiao Jun. Feeling that frustration during competition is understandable. When you experience those angry feelings, what thoughts typically go through your mind?

User: I usually think that it's not fair that others are better than me, and I start comparing myself to them. It just overwhelms me.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts of comparison are triggering your anger. Let's explore this a bit more. What evidence do you have that things are unfair, or that others are better than you?

User: I guess there's not much evidence. Sometimes they just do things faster or get more praise from teachers. But it still feels like I'm always falling behind.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiao Jun. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure during those moments. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice do you think you would give them about feeling behind or frustrated?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their own progress and not worry about others so much. But sometimes it's hard to take my own advice.

Consultant: That's a very helpful perspective, and it's not uncommon to find it easier to advise others than ourselves. Let's try a little role-playing. Imagine you are your best friend. How would you encourage yourself in a similar situation?

User: I think I would say something like, “It’s okay to not be the best. Just try your best, and that’s what matters.” That sounds better than just feeling angry.

Consultant: That’s a great way to transform your thoughts! By focusing on your own efforts, you reduce the pressure of the comparison. How would it feel to remind yourself of that when you start feeling angry?

User: It might help me calm down a bit. I can focus more on doing my best instead of stressing about others.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering to focus on your own progress can help build a healthier mindset. The next time you feel that anger rising, try repeating that encouragement to yourself. Are there any specific situations coming up soon that you can practice this in?

User: Yes! We have a sports day coming up, and I’ll be competing in a few events. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! You can prepare not just physically, but also mentally. Before the events, what can you tell yourself to help keep those feelings of frustration in check?

User: I can tell myself to enjoy the game and that it's okay if I don't win. Just doing my best is enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the experience and focusing on doing your best will help you manage your emotions better. It's about the experience rather than just the outcome. What other strategies do you think might help you in those situations?

User: Maybe I can also take a few deep breaths if I start to feel angry. It might help me relax and think clearer.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic strategy! It can help you center yourself and reduce that initial rush of anger. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Sure! I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly... and, exhale gently. Let’s do it a couple of times. Inhale… and exhale... How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit calmer and more relaxed. I think I can use this before competitions.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have a solid plan for managing your emotions during the upcoming events. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s that I can focus on my own efforts and that it’s okay to not always win. I can also use deep breathing when I get upset.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, Xiao Jun! You’re building a strong toolkit for managing your emotions. How about discussing with your family about these strategies so they can support you during competitions?

User: Yeah, that could be helpful. I might tell them about the breathing technique and what I’m trying to focus on.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can foster a supportive environment. Today, you’ve made great progress in understanding your emotions better. Remember, it’s a journey, and you're not alone in it. I’m looking forward to hearing about how things go during sports day!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and ready to tackle my emotions now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. If you ever need to talk or run through strategies, don’t hesitate to reach out. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Jun! I'm really glad to see you again. Today, let's talk about how you've been feeling and what you've been experiencing lately, especially regarding your communication with your classmates and your family.

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling good about talking with my friends. I learned to work together better with them, and it feels nice. My parents are trying to argue less too, which is great!

Consultant: That sounds like wonderful progress! It’s encouraging to hear that you’re experiencing positive interactions with both your friends and family. Can you share more about how you feel when you collaborate with your classmates?

User: I feel more relaxed and happy. When we work together, I not only get my work done but also make new friends. It’s fun!

Consultant: It must be really enjoyable to work together and make new friends! This collaborative experience seems to be helping you build confidence. How do you think this newfound confidence could influence your interactions at home?

User: I hope it helps me talk to my parents more calmly. Sometimes I still feel a bit scared when we talk about things. 

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It can be challenging to communicate, especially when emotions run high. Would you like to explore some ways to express your feelings to your parents more comfortably?

User: Yes, I think that could help. Maybe I can tell them when something bothers me instead of just keeping it inside. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Expressing your feelings can lead to better understanding. You’ve already shown you can communicate well with friends. Would you like to try to create a plan on how to talk to your parents about your feelings?

User: Sure! I think I would start by choosing a calm moment to talk, like during dinner or after school. 

Consultant: That sounds like a smart choice. Timing can make a big difference! What specific feelings do you want to share with them?

User: I want to tell them that sometimes I feel overwhelmed with schoolwork and that I need more help sometimes.

Consultant: That’s an important feeling to express. It sounds like you want to make sure they understand your needs. How do you think they might respond when you share this with them?

User: I think they might listen since they have been trying to be better at communication lately. I hope they understand.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some hope there, which is great! It's also important to prepare for various responses. What will you do if they don’t fully understand how you feel right away?

User: I guess I might need to explain more. Maybe I can give them examples of when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! Giving specific examples can help illustrate your feelings. It’s about helping them see your perspective. Do you feel confident about having this conversation with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. 

Consultant: That nervousness is completely normal, but your willingness to try is commendable. Would it help to practice what you’d like to say with me?

User: Yes, I would like that! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s say you start the conversation. You can begin with something like, "Mom, Dad, can we talk about something that’s been on my mind?" How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think I could say that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Once you’ve opened the conversation, perhaps you could then say, "I sometimes feel overwhelmed with schoolwork and need some support." How would you feel about expressing it that way?

User: I think that would be okay. It’s straight to the point.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s clear and honest. How do you think your parents might react to you being direct like that?

User: They might be surprised at first, but I hope they will listen. They usually do want to help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective. Remember, being honest about your feelings can strengthen your relationships. How does it feel to prepare for this conversation?

User: It feels good! I feel more ready for it now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Jun! You've taken a big step in preparing yourself. As we move towards the end of our session today, how do you feel about the progress you've made in managing your emotions?

User: I feel more confident now! I think I can use what I’ve learned to handle my feelings better.

Consultant: That's amazing to hear! You've made substantial progress, and it's wonderful to see your growing confidence in handling emotions. Looking ahead, what steps do you think you can take to keep this positive momentum going?

User: I want to keep talking with my friends and family more. Maybe share my thoughts regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular communication can help reinforce the skills you've developed. Do you feel ready to share your experiences with them as you implement these changes?

User: I think I am! I can’t wait to tell them!

Consultant: That enthusiasm is encouraging! I believe you will do great. Remember, if you ever want to revisit our discussions or need more support, you’re always welcome to come back. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Jun! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember to take it one step at a time, and I’m confident you will manage well. Goodbye for now, and take care!

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Jun! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I think I’ve been doing well. I’ve been able to apply some of the techniques we discussed. My parents have noticed, too, and they’re supportive.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you feel you can apply what we've talked about. Could you share a specific example of a technique that you've used recently?

User: Yeah, whenever I started to feel anxious about school, I tried to take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect. It helped calm me down a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Deep breathing can really help in managing anxiety. How did you feel after using that technique?

User: I felt much better! It was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Then I could focus on my homework without panicking.

Consultant: That’s amazing! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. Let’s talk more about how you can continue this momentum. Are there any situations recently where you felt your emotions weren't as stable?

User: Well, sometimes I still feel a bit anxious when I have to present in class. I’ve been working on it, but it’s still challenging.

Consultant: Presenting in front of your classmates can be nerve-wracking. What thoughts go through your mind when you’re about to present?

User: I worry that I’ll forget what I need to say or that everyone will laugh at me.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those fears. Let’s explore that a bit more. If a friend were feeling the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them to just breathe and remember that everyone makes mistakes. It’s not the end of the world.

Consultant: That’s very wise advice! You’re already offering kindness to others. Let’s work on applying that same perspective to yourself. Do you think it’s possible to reframe your thoughts before a presentation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to be nervous and that I don’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing your feelings and allowing yourself room for mistakes can ease the pressure. How do you think you could prepare mentally before your next presentation?

User: I could practice in front of a mirror or with my parents. That way, I can get used to speaking out loud and feel more confident.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Practicing in a comfortable setting can really boost your confidence. Let’s also think about ways you can reward yourself after completing your presentations. What could that look like?

User: Maybe I could plan something fun with my friends, like going to the park.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Having something to look forward to can be a great motivator. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on how far you’ve come and the strategies you can use moving forward. What do you think you’ve learned about managing your emotions?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel nervous and that I can control it with practice. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight, Xiao Jun! You’ve shown resilience and growth. As you continue to practice these skills, remember that it’s a journey. What support do you think you’ll need in the future to maintain your progress?

User: I think I can keep talking to my parents and maybe come back for more sessions if I feel stuck again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Maintaining open communication with your support system is very important. Remember, you can always reach out if you need guidance. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made today. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and don’t hesitate to return for more support when you need it. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
