Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! Welcome to our session today. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've continued to feel quite anxious. My partner's recent threats really affected me, and I'm constantly worried about my safety. It's overwhelming, and I want to be more confident in dealing with this.

Consultant: It sounds really tough, and I'm here to help you navigate through these feelings. Let's start by exploring what specific thoughts or feelings you experience when your partner threatens you. Can you share one of those moments with me?

User: Sure. When he gets angry, I feel a rush of fear. My mind goes blank, and I think about how trapped I feel. It's like I can’t escape, and I often end up just trying to keep him calm, even if it makes me uncomfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like an incredibly difficult situation. So, in those moments, it seems you're caught between wanting to keep the peace and feeling unsafe. When that fear arises, what thoughts race through your mind?

User: I keep worrying that if I stand up for myself, it will escalate the situation. I also think that maybe I deserve it if I somehow upset him. It’s confusing.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s completely natural to want to avoid confrontation, especially when you’re feeling threatened. However, it’s important to recognize that you don’t deserve to feel that way. Could we try identifying those thoughts that suggest you deserve this—how true do you think they are?

User: Honestly, I know deep down that they aren’t true. But in the moment, those thoughts just take over, and I forget what I really believe.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Your mind can sometimes react in ways that don’t reflect your true self-worth. Let’s work on challenging those thoughts together. Can you think of a time when you stood up for yourself or felt proud of how you handled a difficult situation?

User: I remember once, my friend was in a similar situation, and I encouraged her to seek help. I felt good about being there for her, but I don’t know if I could do the same for myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful example! You showed strength and support for another person. It shows you have that capability within you. What if we explored ways you can apply that same support to yourself, recognizing your right to safety and happiness?

User: That could be helpful. I think I struggle to prioritize myself over others, especially in tough situations.

Consultant: You deserve care and safety just like anyone else. Would you feel comfortable practicing some affirmations that reinforce your self-worth and your right to set boundaries? We could create a few together.

User: Yes, I think that could help. I do need to remind myself that I’m allowed to feel safe.

Consultant: Great! How about something like, “I deserve to feel safe and respected”? How does that resonate with you?

User: That actually feels good to say. It’s simple but powerful.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start by repeating that daily. Now, regarding your current situation, what external resources, like support groups or hotlines, can you explore to help you feel safer?

User: I haven’t looked into that yet. I suppose some kind of support group could help me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Connecting with others who understand your experience can be incredibly empowering. Would you like to make a plan to search for some resources together after this session?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I’d feel less overwhelmed with support.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to see you engaging in this process. Remember that it’s okay to take small steps. Now, as we begin to think about ending our session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway today?

User: I think realizing that I have the right to advocate for myself and seek support is important. It’s pretty liberating.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You've made significant progress in recognizing your value and rights. As we wrap up, remember that you are not alone in this journey. What strategies can you utilize when you face similar challenges in the future?

User: I can remind myself of my worth, practice those affirmations, and reach out for help if I need it.

Consultant: Exactly! You've created a great action plan. This is our last session for now, but keep using those strategies. Always feel free to come back if you need support. Wishing you courage and strength ahead, Miss Zhang.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit anxious. I keep thinking about my relationship and the pressure I experience. It’s hard to shake off the feeling that I should just accept it.

Consultant: I can see how hard that must be for you. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when dealing with such pressure. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts or feelings that come up for you in these moments?

User: I often think that maybe I deserve the pressure or that it's just part of the relationship. I have this inner voice that tells me to just get used to it, but it makes me feel really uneasy.

Consultant: It sounds like you're grappling with some negative beliefs about yourself and your situation. Let's take a moment to identify those thoughts. When you say "I deserve this," where do you think that belief comes from?

User: I think it stems from my past experiences. I’ve been in a similar situation before, and it just feels like I’m stuck in this cycle. 

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. A lot of people develop beliefs based on their past experiences. Now, let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you deserve to feel this way? 

User: Well, I don’t have clear evidence; it just feels like my reality. I sometimes feel like I’m not strong enough to demand better.

Consultant: It's really brave of you to recognize that feeling. Remember, feeling weak doesn’t define your true strength. Let's explore this further—if a friend came to you with similar thoughts, what would you say to them?

User: I would tell them they deserve to be in a safe and loving environment. I’d encourage them to stand up for themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You recognize the value of safety and love for others, which shows that you understand what a healthy relationship looks like. Why shouldn’t you afford yourself that same belief?

User: I see your point. I guess I do have a hard time believing that I deserve that for myself.

Consultant: Acknowledging that is a vital step! You absolutely deserve a healthy and safe environment. Let’s work together on setting personal boundaries. What does setting a boundary look like for you in this context?

User: I think it means standing up for myself and not accepting behavior that makes me uncomfortable. But the thought of expressing that frightens me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared when considering setting boundaries. It requires courage. Would you be open to practicing how to express those boundaries in a safe environment today?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I need to build up my confidence.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a scenario where you express a boundary to your partner. What situation would you like to address first?

User: I often feel uneasy when he raises his voice. I want to tell him that it’s unacceptable for me.

Consultant: Let’s start there. How would you say that to him, keeping in mind that you have every right to feel safe?

User: I think I’d say, “I don’t feel comfortable when you raise your voice. I need you to talk to me calmly.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to communicate your boundary! It’s clear and assertive. How does saying that out loud make you feel?

User: A bit nervous, but also relieved because I’m expressing how I feel.

Consultant: That’s a positive reaction! Remember, expressing your needs is crucial for establishing boundaries. What do you think might happen if you communicate this?

User: I fear that he might react negatively, but I also hope he would understand and respect my feelings.

Consultant: It’s healthy to have both thoughts. While we can’t control how others react, standing up for your own needs is empowering. Would it feel better for you if we talked about some strategies to handle potential negative reactions?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I feel I need to prepare for how I might respond if he gets upset.

Consultant: Absolutely. One approach is to remain calm and reiterate your point. You can say something like, “I understand that this might be hard for you, but I need to express my feelings.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I think keeping calm will help both of us.

Consultant: Great! How about we summarize what we’ve talked about today? 

User: Sure. I’ve realized that I have the right to set boundaries and deserve a safe environment. Practicing how to express those boundaries gives me hope and a sense of empowerment.

Consultant: Well done! You've made significant progress. As we conclude today, remind yourself that you’ve taken the first steps. What strategies do you think you can use in the future to maintain these boundaries?

User: I can remind myself of my worth and practice expressing my feelings calmly. 

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, you have the strength and capability to maintain those boundaries. If you ever feel uncertain, just revisit our conversations. I'm here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle my situation now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Continue to embrace your power, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm happy to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident lately. I’ve been practicing setting personal boundaries more effectively, and it seems to be helping me cope with things better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making progress in strengthening your ability to set boundaries. Can you share an instance where you applied these skills recently?

User: Sure! Just last week, I had to tell a friend that I couldn't help her move. I usually would have just said yes, but I stood my ground, and it felt good.

Consultant: That's an impressive step! Standing your ground is a significant accomplishment. How did it feel to assert your needs in that situation?

User: I felt empowered, actually. For the first time, I was prioritizing my own needs instead of just going along with what others wanted.

Consultant: It sounds like you're starting to embrace the power of your own voice, which is very encouraging. Are there any challenges you've faced while trying to maintain these boundaries?

User: Yes, sometimes I still feel guilty for saying no. It's hard to shake off the feeling that I might disappoint others.

Consultant: That guilt can be quite common when we first start asserting our needs. Let’s explore that guilt a bit. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel guilty for not meeting someone else's request?

User: I often think that I'm being selfish or that people won't like me as much if I don’t help them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts. But let’s challenge them. Do you think it’s truly selfish to take care of your own needs?

User: I suppose it's not, but I still struggle with it. I want to help, but I also want to feel good about myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's important to recognize that taking care of yourself allows you to be more present and supportive to others when you’re able. How about we come up with some strategies to help you manage that guilt?

User: That would be helpful! I want to feel okay about saying no without constantly second-guessing myself.

Consultant: Great! One technique could be to reframe your thoughts about setting boundaries. When you feel guilty, remind yourself that you are not responsible for other people's emotions. You, too, have the right to prioritize your well-being. How does that resonate with you?

User: That makes sense. I often put everyone's needs before mine. Reframing sounds like a good approach.

Consultant: Reframing your perspective can be very powerful. Let’s also consider creating a list of affirmations you can remind yourself of when you face situations where you feel guilty about saying no. Would you be open to that?

User: Absolutely! That sounds really useful.

Consultant: Perfect! Together, we can draft a few affirmations that resonate with your values and desires. For example, “My needs matter just as much as anyone else’s” or “Taking care of myself allows me to be better for others.” What do you think about those?

User: I like them! They feel empowering and a good reminder of what I need to focus on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! We can work on developing more personalized affirmations too. How about we also role-play a scenario where you practice saying no? This could help reinforce your new mindset.

User: That sounds great! I think practicing would really help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Awesome! Do you have a specific situation in mind where you would like to practice saying no?

User: Yes, my colleague often asks me to cover shifts for her, and I’ve always said yes before. I'd like to practice saying no to that.

Consultant: Excellent choice. When your colleague asks you to cover a shift, let’s try saying something like, “I appreciate you thinking of me, but I need to prioritize my own time right now.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds clear and respectful. I’d feel more confident saying it that way.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s assertive while still being respectful. How about we rehearse it a couple of times together?

User: Yes, let’s do that!

Consultant: Alright! I’ll be your colleague. “Hey, could you cover my shift next week?”

User: Thanks for thinking of me, but I need to prioritize my own time right now.

Consultant: Great job! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good! I think I could actually say that.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! Practicing like this can help immensely when you encounter the real situation. Let’s reaffirm the progress you’ve made today. What do you feel you’ve accomplished in this session?

User: I feel like I’ve taken a real step forward in managing my boundaries. Practicing saying no makes me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made excellent strides in reinforcing your boundaries and addressing the guilt that comes with it. Before we conclude today, let's think about any specific scenarios for next week where you might want to apply these skills.

User: I think I’ll have a few social gatherings coming up, and I can use this in those situations.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! Remember to use your affirmations and practice what we discussed. I'm confident you'll continue to grow in your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help in this process.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure working with you. You’re doing wonderfully, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep building on this positive change!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling better overall. I've managed to communicate my concerns to my partner and I've received support from my friends, which feels really good. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're taking positive steps to address your feelings. Can you share how that experience impacted your sense of control in your life?

User: I feel like I’m gaining more control over my life. Being able to express my needs made me feel empowered, and I hope to keep that momentum going in other areas of my life.

Consultant: I'm glad you're experiencing that sense of empowerment. It sounds like you're ready to expand this newfound confidence into your professional and social interactions. What specific areas do you think you’d like to focus on next?

User: I’d like to become more confident during meetings at work. I often find myself hesitating to share my ideas due to fear of judgment.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel hesitant in those situations. Let’s explore that a bit—what thoughts go through your mind that make you feel you should hold back during meetings?

User: I often think that my ideas might not be well-received or that they could be seen as silly. 

Consultant: I understand. It seems like you might be experiencing some negative thoughts about sharing your ideas. Can you recall a situation where you shared your ideas but were pleasantly surprised by the feedback?

User: Yes, actually. There was one time I suggested a new project approach, and my manager liked it. It made me feel good, but I still doubt myself in future meetings.

Consultant: That’s a great example that shows you can succeed. How might you challenge those negative thoughts before your next meeting?

User: I guess I could remind myself of that positive experience and maybe write down affirmations to boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing down affirmations can be a powerful tool. What would be an affirmation that resonates with you regarding sharing your ideas?

User: Something like, “My ideas are valuable, and I contribute positively to my team.”

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! Now, let's practice integrating that into your mindset. When you prepare for your next meeting, how can you remind yourself of this affirmation?

User: I could say it out loud before the meeting, maybe while looking in the mirror. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Visualization can also reinforce that positive feeling. Is there anything else you’d like to focus on regarding your social interactions?

User: I want to feel comfortable initiating conversations with new people. I often feel anxious about approaching others.

Consultant: Starting conversations can be intimidating. What thoughts run through your mind when you consider initiating a conversation?

User: I worry about whether they will want to talk to me or if I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really self-limiting. Have you ever initiated a conversation and found it went better than you expected?

User: Yes, I once chatted with a neighbor, and we ended up talking for an hour. It was really nice!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic experience! How can you remind yourself of that positive outcome when you feel anxious about starting a conversation in the future?

User: I think I could use that experience as motivation. Maybe I can remind myself that people generally appreciate a friendly approach.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Focusing on the positive response from others can help reduce anxiety. Let’s think about some practical conversation starters you can keep in your back pocket for those moments. 

User: Maybe I could ask about their weekend or comment on something happening in our community.

Consultant: Those are perfect conversation starters! They are neutral and can open up a dialogue. Let’s also role-play a scenario where you initiate a conversation. How does that sound? 

User: That sounds helpful! I often find practicing helps me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine we’re at a social gathering, and I’m someone you don’t know. How would you approach me?

User: I could say, “Hi! I’m Zhang. I noticed you were talking about the neighborhood cleanup. I’d love to hear more about it!”

Consultant: That was a wonderful approach! You’re being open and showing interest. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good! I think I can remember to be open and ask questions. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, the more you practice initiating conversations, the easier it will become. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel more optimistic. I really think I can apply the affirmations and practice starting conversations.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’re making great strides in recognizing your strengths. As we finish today’s session, what key takeaway would you like to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember that my ideas are valuable, and I can start conversations by being friendly and interested in others.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Keeping that in mind will definitely help you continue to build your confidence. I believe you’ll keep growing and discovering new paths for personal development. If you ever need support again, feel free to come back. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Miss Zhang! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. I'm interested to hear about how you've been feeling since our last meeting.

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. It seems that joining those social activities has really helped me connect with some supportive people, which is a nice change. 

Consultant: That sounds encouraging! It's great to hear that you’re finding support in your new social circle. Can you share more about how these connections have positively impacted you?

User: Yes, I feel like I'm not alone anymore. I used to feel really isolated, but now I have friends who understand what I've been through. It’s reassuring.

Consultant: That sense of companionship can make a significant difference. It seems like these friendships have brought you a sense of understanding and acceptance. How do you think you can build on this support network even further?

User: I’ve been thinking about inviting some of them to do activities together, like hiking or even trying out a new hobby. I want to strengthen those bonds.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging in activities together can deepen those connections. What kind of hobbies or interests have you considered exploring with them?

User: I love the idea of hiking! I’ve also been curious about arts and crafts, maybe starting a painting class. Seems fun and a nice way to bond.

Consultant: Those sound like enjoyable activities! Exploring arts and crafts could also be a creative outlet for you. What are your thoughts on how participating in these hobbies might help you in your personal growth journey?

User: I think it could boost my confidence. Creating something can be fulfilling, and being around supportive people while doing it could make things even better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in creative activities can foster self-expression and enhance your confidence. Have you experienced any thoughts or feelings about stepping outside your comfort zone to try new things?

User: Honestly, there’s a bit of anxiety about it. I'm worried I might not be good enough, or that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about trying new things, especially when we have high expectations for ourselves. Can you identify any specific thoughts that contribute to that anxiety?

User: I often think that if I don’t excel at something right away, I’ll be seen as a failure. It’s like I have this pressure to impress others.

Consultant: That’s a common cognitive distortion known as "all-or-nothing thinking." It makes it hard to see the value in simply trying and enjoying the process rather than focusing on the outcome. How might you challenge that belief?

User: I could remind myself that everyone starts as a beginner and that the experience itself is what matters, not just the outcome.

Consultant: Exactly! Gradually challenging that perception can ease the pressure you put on yourself. What small step could you take to enjoy the process without focusing solely on the outcome?

User: Maybe I could just go to a painting class without any expectations, focusing on having fun and meeting new people instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Allowing yourself the freedom to enjoy the experience can be liberating. What emotions arise when you think about pursuing this plan?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. The thought of being creative in front of others is a bit intimidating but also thrilling.

Consultant: Embracing those mixed feelings is part of the journey! It shows that you're challenging yourself. If you find it overwhelming, how might you ease those nerves in the moment?

User: I think I could take a few deep breaths or remind myself of the support around me. It might help to remember that everyone is there to have fun too.

Consultant: Great strategies! Deep breathing can help ground you, and focusing on the collective enjoyment will help shift your thoughts. As we continue to explore your goals, how do you envision utilizing this support network to achieve your personal aspirations?

User: I see us sharing our experiences and encouraging each other. I want to be more open about my goals and not just keep them to myself.

Consultant: Sharing your aspirations can invite encouragement and accountability from those supportive connections. What specific goals do you have in mind that you’d like to share with them?

User: I’d like to work on my confidence in social situations and develop my painting skills. It would be nice to have a group to share that journey with.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Gaining confidence in social settings can be fundamental to your growth. What steps can you take to start integrating these goals into your interactions with your support network?

User: Maybe setting a weekly meetup for painting or just relaxing and chatting. I can also open up about my past experiences and how I want to move forward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Creating regular meetups gives you a consistent support system. As we look ahead, how do you feel about balancing these activities and your current responsibilities?

User: I think I can manage it. I might need to be mindful of my time and not overcommit, but I believe it’s possible.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel optimistic about managing your time. Balancing responsibilities with new activities is crucial. As we wrap up, how have you felt about the progress you've made today and the strategies you've discussed?

User: I feel a lot more confident about using my support network to grow and try new things. I appreciate the insight on my thoughts regarding expectations.

Consultant: I’m glad you found our discussion helpful! Remember, the journey is about progress, not perfection. As you move forward, keep challenging those negative thoughts and lean into your support system. You've made significant strides, and I believe in your ability to keep growing.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared to face my goals with a positive mindset.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ms. Zhang! I'm excited for you and your journey ahead. Remember, I’m here if you need further support. Keep in touch, and take care!

User: Thank you, I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel quite stable overall, and I'm actually excited about the future. I have a support network now, which is comforting. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! Having a support network can make a big difference. What specific goals or plans are you contemplating for your future? 

User: I've been thinking about exploring some new career options. I want to feel more confident and fulfilled in my professional life. 

Consultant: It’s great that you’re considering new career paths! What does confidence and fulfillment look like for you in a job? 

User: I imagine being in a role where I feel valued and can use my skills effectively. I want to feel proud of my work. 

Consultant: That’s a meaningful aspiration. Let’s dig a bit deeper—what skills do you feel you have that you want to utilize in your future career? 

User: I believe I’m great at communication and problem-solving. I’ve also developed more resilience since last year. 

Consultant: Those are valuable strengths! How have these skills been beneficial to you in your past experiences? 

User: I’ve been able to articulate my thoughts better, and I’ve managed to handle stressful situations with more calmness. 

Consultant: That’s impressive! It certainly sounds like you’re on the right track. What challenges do you think you might face in pursuing new opportunities? 

User: I guess I worry about stepping out of my comfort zone and whether I’ll be able to handle a new environment. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those concerns when considering change. Can you think of strategies that have helped you overcome fears in the past? 

User: I tend to break things down into smaller steps instead of facing everything at once. That really helps. 

Consultant: Breaking things down is an excellent approach! How might you apply that method to exploring new career options? 

User: I could start by researching different roles, perhaps reach out to people in those industries, and maybe try some volunteer work to gain experience. 

Consultant: Those sound like actionable steps! It seems like you’re already planning your exploration thoughtfully. What fears or thoughts might hold you back as you begin this process? 

User: Sometimes, I doubt whether I’m qualified enough for certain positions, even when I have related experience. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have self-doubt, but let’s explore that. What evidence do you have that suggests you're not qualified? 

User: I guess it's just that nagging voice that compares me to others and makes me feel inadequate. 

Consultant: Recognizing that voice is a great first step! How would you respond to a friend who expressed similar doubts about their qualifications? 

User: I’d remind them of their strengths and experiences—they are more than capable! 

Consultant: Exactly! You can extend that same kindness and understanding to yourself. What could you tell yourself to counter that self-doubt? 

User: I could remind myself of my skills and accomplishments, and that I am worthy of pursuing my goals. 

Consultant: That’s powerful thinking! How do you feel about incorporating that affirmation into your daily routine as you explore new career options? 

User: I like that idea. I can write it down and remind myself every morning. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful practice. It helps in reinforcing positive beliefs about yourself. What else do you want to accomplish during our session today? 

User: I want to discuss ways to maintain my confidence as I move forward. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s think about strategies you can employ to nurture your confidence throughout this journey. 

User: I think setting small, achievable goals would help and keeping track of my progress would be motivating. 

Consultant: Great idea! Celebrating your successes, no matter how small, can boost your confidence. Are there any particular rewards you would consider for your achievements? 

User: Maybe treating myself to something nice or spending time with friends when I reach a goal could be nice.

Consultant: Those sound like fulfilling rewards! Is there anything else you feel you need in order to stay motivated? 

User: Having regular check-ins with you would help keep me on track and address any fears that come up. 

Consultant: Of course! We can schedule regular sessions to ensure you’re supported throughout your journey. It’s important to have that accountability. 

User: Thank you! I think I really needed this conversation to clarify my thoughts and feelings. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you pursue these goals. You’ve shown tremendous growth already. 

User: I feel much more optimistic now. I’m ready to take these steps! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! As we wrap up, let’s summarize what we discussed and any action steps you’d like to take moving forward. 

User: I’ll work on researching roles, reach out for informational interviews, and remind myself of my strengths daily. 

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! I’m proud of you for taking these initiatives. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, remember those affirmations and your support network. 

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I feel more prepared now! 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made great progress. Remember, I’m here to support you, and I look forward to our next session. Take care until then! 

User: Thank you! I will.
