Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I'm so glad you've come for today's session. I want to talk about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's currently on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious about my studies. Being at home and doing online classes, I don't think I'm learning as well as I could. I'm worried that when I go back to school, my grades will be worse than my classmates'.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure about your studies and your performance in school. Can you tell me a bit more about how this anxiety has been affecting you?

User: Well, it makes me feel really low. Sometimes, I even think about... not wanting to be here anymore. It's just really overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, Yaya. It's important that we talk about these feelings. You've mentioned feeling anxious and even having thoughts that are concerning. Have you noticed specific moments when this anxiety becomes stronger?

User: Yeah, whenever I sit down to study, I just feel like I can't focus. I keep thinking about how I might fall behind and it makes it even harder to concentrate.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It seems your worries about falling behind in your studies are creating a cycle of anxiety that makes focusing even harder. Have any specific thoughts crossed your mind during those moments that contribute to this feeling?

User: I often think that I'm just not smart enough or that I’ll always be behind. I worry my friends will think less of me if I don’t do well.

Consultant: Those are quite negative thoughts, Yaya, and it’s understandable how they could increase your anxiety. Let’s take a moment to reflect on them. How true do you think these thoughts really are? Is there any evidence that supports these beliefs about yourself?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid proof. Sometimes I do well on tests and I have friends who support me, but I just keep focusing on the bad things.

Consultant: That’s a good insight, Yaya! You have shown that you can succeed, and your friends value you for who you are, not just your grades. Let’s work on challenging those thoughts together. If a friend of yours was feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably remind them about their strengths and that everyone struggles at times. I would say it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re capable of offering kindness and support to others, so remember to practice that with yourself as well. What could be a positive thought to replace the thought of not being smart enough?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that I’m doing my best and that I have the ability to learn and improve.

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation, Yaya! Focusing on your efforts rather than the end results can really help shift your mindset. How do you feel about trying to repeat that to yourself when those negative thoughts arise?

User: I feel like that would help! I should try it when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Great! I believe it will make a difference. Now, let’s also talk about your sleep. I understand that you’ve been having trouble sleeping. Can you tell me about that?

User: Yes, I stay awake for a long time, just thinking about school and how anxious I feel. It’s hard to fall asleep.

Consultant: It’s tough when your mind is racing. Sometimes, creating a calming bedtime routine can help with sleep. Have you thought about any activities that could help your mind relax before bed? 

User: I think reading a book might help, or maybe listening to some soft music.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Both can help distract your mind and promote relaxation. Would you be willing to try one of those activities before bed this week?

User: Sure! I’ll try to read for a little bit before sleeping.

Consultant: That's a positive step! Now, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. We've focused on challenging your negative thoughts about your academic abilities and recognized the importance of self-kindness. You also plan to try reading before bed to improve your sleep. 

User: Yes, I feel a bit relieved having talked about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yaya. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious but important to reach out for help and support. As we continue our sessions, we can build on these strategies. How do you feel about our next meeting?

User: I feel optimistic! I hope I can use what we've talked about.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Keep practicing those positive affirmations and your bedtime routine. Together, we’ll continue working on these thoughts and feelings. I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care, Yaya!

Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I’m really glad you could join me today. I know we’ve talked about some heavy feelings in our previous sessions. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious with school starting again. I’m worried I won't keep up with my classmates and my grades will fall behind.

Consultant: That sounds very stressful, Yaya. It’s understandable to feel anxious about not meeting expectations, especially with school resuming. Can you share more about what specific thoughts have been running through your mind regarding your schoolwork?

User: I keep thinking that everyone else will be doing better than me, and I worry that I won't remember anything I learned while we were doing online classes. It makes me feel like I'll never catch up.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a pressure to perform at a level that feels overwhelming. Let’s explore those thoughts a little deeper. When you think, “I won't remember anything,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel hopeless and scared. I feel like crying sometimes because I think I won’t be able to handle the work. 

Consultant: I can hear how much distress that thought is causing you. It’s really important to acknowledge those feelings. Let’s look at that thought—how realistic do you think it is that you won’t remember anything from online classes? Is there any evidence that might suggest otherwise?

User: Well, I guess I did understand some things during the online classes. But I still feel like since I haven't practiced it, I’ll forget everything. 

Consultant: That’s a really valid point. Remembering things can certainly be challenging without practice. But what if we consider some recent evidence? What’s something you successfully learned during online classes that you still remember now?

User: I remember we had a math lesson about fractions, and I actually did pretty well on the test afterward. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that you can learn and retain information, even after a break. How do you think you could remind yourself of that capability when you start to feel anxious again?

User: Maybe I could tell myself I’ve done well before and that I can do it again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Challenging those anxious thoughts with positive experiences can be really helpful. What other techniques might you try when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises or maybe even talk to a friend about how I feel. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Yaya! Having some deep breathing techniques and reaching out to friends can help ground you during anxious moments. Can we also think of how you might structure your study time to make it feel less overwhelming?

User: I could plan small study sessions instead of trying to do everything at once. 

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable pieces can help you tackle your studies without feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to outline a potential study plan together?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel more organized.

Consultant: Great! How many days a week do you think you could dedicate to studying, Yaya? We can create a schedule that balances study sessions and breaks.

User: Maybe four days a week, and I can do 30-45 minutes each time. 

Consultant: That sounds very realistic! How about we also add some specific topics you’d like to focus on to each day? This can make your sessions more targeted and manageable. 

User: Yes! I can focus on math one day and language arts another day.

Consultant: Perfect! This structure will give you clear goals to aim for each study session. Do you feel more at ease now thinking about a plan like this?

User: A bit, yes. It’s nice to have a clear plan instead of just worrying.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we move forward, let’s also talk about how to keep your mind calm at night, especially since you've mentioned sleep difficulties. Have you tried any wind-down routines before sleep?

User: I’ve been staying up late on my phone, which probably doesn’t help.

Consultant: It’s quite common for screens to keep us alert. A wind-down routine that involves less screen time might help. Would you be open to trying some activities that promote relaxation before bed instead?

User: Yeah, that could be good. Maybe reading or listening to calm music?

Consultant: Those are wonderful options! Reading or listening to music can certainly help your mind relax. Let’s aim for a specific time to start your wind-down routine—what time do you think that should be for you?

User: I think maybe starting at 9 PM would be good.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Incorporating relaxation activities at 9 PM could create a nice buffer before bedtime. How do you feel about all of this, Yaya?

User: I feel more hopeful about things. It seems more manageable now.

Consultant: It's encouraging to see you feeling hopeful! Just remember that it’s all about taking one step at a time. Keep using the strategies we discussed today, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you feel overwhelmed again. 

User: Thank you for your help! I appreciate it a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yaya! Remember, you’re capable of handling this, and I believe in your strength. Looking forward to our next session, where we can check in on your progress. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Ya Ya! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve still been feeling quite anxious about my schoolwork. The results of the small test didn't help at all. I fear I might fall behind my classmates when I go back to school.

Consultant: I understand, that must be really tough for you. It sounds like the anxiety about your grades is still quite challenging. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about school or your test results?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't do well, everyone will see me as a failure. I also worry that I won’t be able to catch up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, Ya Ya. It seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly. Let's explore this a bit. What feelings do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel really sad and scared. Sometimes I even think about how I don’t want to go back to school because I'm afraid I’ll disappoint everyone.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel scared and sad under such pressure. It seems like the fear of disappointing others is a significant factor for you. Have you noticed if these feelings affect your ability to focus on your learning?

User: Yes, sometimes I just can't concentrate, and I feel like giving up. My mind just gets too overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like when you feel overwhelmed, it becomes difficult for you to engage with your studies. Let's try to identify some of the automatic thoughts you experience. Can you tell me a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Last week during a practice test, I felt so anxious that I kept thinking I’d fail. It was hard for me to see the questions clearly.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Ya Ya. In that moment, when you were taking the test and thinking you would fail, what emotions did you feel in your body?

User: I felt my heart racing, and I even got a bit shaky. I wanted to leave the room.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It seems like your body was responding strongly to your anxious thoughts. Let’s take a closer look at the thought, “I will fail.” What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and is there any evidence against it?

User: I guess I don't really have proof that I will fail. I did okay on some tests before, but I keep worrying that my future results won't be good.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Ya Ya. It appears that your mind is focusing heavily on the worst-case scenario rather than considering your past successes. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to think differently about the test results?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to have a bad day and that they shouldn’t give up just because of one test.

Consultant: That's very thoughtful advice, and it indicates you have a compassionate side towards others. Let’s work on applying that same kindness to yourself. How about we develop some practical goals for your studies that can help reduce this anxiety?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I can try studying in smaller chunks, instead of all at once.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking your studies into smaller, manageable chunks can help you feel more in control. Let’s define specific subjects or topics you'd like to focus on first. What’s the first subject you’d like to tackle?

User: I think I need to work on math because that’s where I feel weakest.

Consultant: Great choice! Let’s set a realistic goal. How many sessions of study would you like to dedicate to math this week?

User: Maybe three short sessions of half an hour each would be good.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable, Ya Ya! In addition to studying, let's also think about incorporating a fun activity afterward to motivate you. What kinds of activities do you enjoy?

User: I like drawing and reading! They help me relax.

Consultant: Wonderful! After each study session, you could reward yourself with some drawing or reading time. Let’s also discuss strategies to manage your emotions when you start feeling overwhelmed. What do you think would help you when those feelings arise?

User: I usually try to breathe deeply, but sometimes I forget to do that when I'm stressed.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy. How about we practice it together now? When you start to feel anxious, take a moment to close your eyes, breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, and then breathe out for six seconds. Would you be willing to try that?

User: Yes, I can try to remember that next time.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to remember it. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on one lesson you’ve learned. What stands out to you from our discussion today?

User: I guess I learned that my thoughts can be less than reliable, and I should be kinder to myself, just like I would be to a friend.

Consultant: That's a beautiful takeaway, Ya Ya. It’s important to treat yourself with the same kindness you offer others. As you continue to work on your study plan and self-compassion, keep reminding yourself that progress takes time. Remember, I’m here to support you. Shall we plan to meet again soon?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, but I still feel anxious about school. I try to participate in activities, but I can't shake off the worry that I might fall behind my classmates.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been participating in activities. Balancing these can indeed help with your overall emotions. Can you share what specific feelings or thoughts come to your mind when you think about falling behind?

User: I just imagine my classmates doing well and me struggling. Sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough, and it makes me really anxious to think about it.

Consultant: Those feelings can be overwhelming. It sounds like you might be comparing yourself to your classmates, which can lead to stress. What do you think about these comparisons? 

User: Yeah, I think I might be too hard on myself. I see others succeeding, and it makes me feel worse about my own situation.

Consultant: Recognizing that is an important step, Yaya. Let's explore this a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are not succeeding like your classmates?

User: Well, I got a couple of lower grades last time, and I didn’t understand the last subject we covered very well.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel discouraged after some lower grades. However, grades are just a snapshot of your performance at one moment. Have you considered other aspects where you might be doing well? 

User: I guess I did participate in a group project and everyone said I contributed well. But I still focus too much on those grades.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It’s fantastic that you contributed positively to your group. Focusing only on grades can sometimes overshadow other successes. What would it feel like to acknowledge those contributions as part of your success too?

User: It would feel good, but I’m worried that if I focus too much on that, I might let my grades slip even further.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to celebrate successes while also working on improvement. What if we created a plan to balance recognizing your strengths with strategies to boost your grades? 

User: That sounds good. I want to feel better about myself but also not ignore my studies.

Consultant: Absolutely, Yaya. Let’s identify a few strengths you have outside of academics and how they can support your studies. What do you think you enjoy most about the activities you've participated in?

User: I really enjoy working with my friends. It makes me feel happy and less anxious. 

Consultant: That connection with friends is a wonderful strength! You could use it as motivation when studying. Perhaps consider forming a study group or sharing what you learn with them. How does that sound?

User: That could work! I think it would help me feel less alone while studying.

Consultant: Exactly! It can also make learning more enjoyable. Let’s discuss some specific subjects you find challenging and how a study group might help tackle those areas together. 

User: Math is a bit tough for me. I often feel stuck and don’t know how to ask for help sometimes.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel stuck—many students do in math. You might try sharing your struggles with your friends during your study sessions. They may not only understand but can help explain things in a way that makes sense to you.

User: I never thought of it that way. It’s nice to know that I can lean on them without feeling embarrassed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Vulnerability often fosters stronger connections. It’s okay to ask for help; in fact, it can show your strength. What do you think you can say to your friends to ask for their support in math?

User: I could just say I’m having a tough time and would appreciate their help. That seems doable.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Also, how about creating a mini recap after each study session? It could boost your confidence by showing your progress over time. Would that be helpful?

User: I like that idea! I can see how tracking my progress could motivate me.

Consultant: Wonderful! This can keep you focused on continuous growth. Remember, it’s about steady steps rather than perfection. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel excited about it! I think having support will really help me.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! With support and a focus on both your strengths and areas for improvement, you’re setting yourself up for greater success. For our next session, we can review how this plan has been working for you. 

User: That sounds perfect. I will definitely try to reach out to my friends and keep track of my progress!

Consultant: Excellent, Yaya! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Before we end, let’s quickly recap the key points you’ve committed to for next time.

User: I will ask my friends for math help and keep track of my progress. I’ll also remember to celebrate my strengths in the activities I enjoy.

Consultant: That’s a solid summary! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Our next session will be a chance to reflect on your experiences. You have been making progress, and I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I feel much better talking about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yaya! I’m glad to hear that. See you in our next session, and take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Yaya! It's great to see you again. I’m glad to hear that your sleep has improved lately. I’d like to talk about that and how you’ve been feeling regarding your studies. How are things going for you?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still worry about falling behind when I go back to school. Sometimes, I doubt if I'm studying effectively during online classes.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with the transition back to school. Can you share more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about your studies and returning to school?

User: I often think that my friends might be learning faster than I am. It makes me anxious, and I feel like I’m going to disappoint my teachers and family.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself based on comparisons. How do you think that mindset affects your motivation to study?

User: It makes me feel overwhelmed, and sometimes I just want to give up. I wish I could be more like my friends who seem to handle everything so easily.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Yaya. Comparing yourself to others can create a lot of stress. What would it look like for you to shift your focus from others to your own progress? 

User: I guess if I could focus on doing my best instead of worrying about them, it would help. But it’s hard to stop thinking about it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to find it hard to let go of those thoughts. Let's try to identify the evidence behind your feelings. What concrete experiences do you have that support the idea that you may fall behind?

User: I think because I haven’t been studying with friends lately, I feel out of touch. I notice they seem more confident.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. But remember, confidence can be built through practice and preparation. Have you considered some ways to practice studying actively, even alone?

User: I think I could try setting small targets for my study sessions, like studying for 20 minutes at a time and then taking a break.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Breaking tasks into smaller pieces can make them feel less daunting. How do you think achieving these small goals would make you feel?

User: It might make me feel more accomplished, and hopefully, a bit less anxious about school.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small achievements can boost your confidence. Let's think about one specific goal you’d like to set for this week.

User: I want to review the math lessons I struggled with recently. Maybe start with one lesson per day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Yaya. With that clear plan, how do you feel now about tackling those math lessons?

User: I feel a bit more in control and less anxious. It sounds manageable!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. How can you remind yourself to focus on your own journey rather than comparing with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could write down what I’ve accomplished at the end of each day to reflect on my progress.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping track of your achievements can help reinforce your self-esteem and confidence. Are there any other techniques you think might help you stay positive about your studies?

User: I could also talk to my parents about how I’m feeling. They’re really supportive and can help me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful thought, Yaya. Having that support system can make a significant difference. How do you feel about sharing your feelings with them?

User: I think I would feel relieved. It would help to know they understand and can encourage me.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it's okay to express your concerns. You've come a long way in managing your feelings. Let’s recap what we’ve discussed today. What do you think is your key takeaway from our session?

User: I guess the most important thing is focusing on my own progress and setting small, achievable goals.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing your progress is crucial. As we wrap up, how do you plan to maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that my journey is unique and celebrate my little victories.

Consultant: That sounds perfect, Yaya. I'm really proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you feel the need. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I think I have some concrete steps to take now and that makes me feel hopeful.

Consultant: I'm delighted to hear that! Keep that hope alive, Yaya. This is our last session for now, but remember that you have earned the skills to navigate your emotions on your own. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care, and remember to celebrate your progress along the way!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I’m glad to see you again for today’s session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve tried to focus more on my studies, and I think my self-esteem has improved a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're really making progress. Can you share some specific ways you’ve noticed improvements in your studies or self-esteem?

User: Well, I’ve been setting small goals for myself while studying, and I celebrate when I achieve them. It feels good to recognize my progress, even if it's just a little.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Yaya! Setting small goals can really help build confidence. What type of goals have you set for yourself recently?

User: I’ve been trying to finish my homework earlier in the week instead of waiting until the last minute. It’s been a challenge, but I'm getting there!

Consultant: That’s impressive! It sounds like you’re developing a healthier routine with your studies. How has accomplishing these goals made you feel about your upcoming return to school?

User: I feel a little less anxious about going back. I think I can keep up with my friends and do well in class.

Consultant: It’s nice to hear that you’re feeling more prepared! As you return to school, what do you think might be some challenges you might face?

User: I worry that I’ll still feel overwhelmed with all the subjects and if I can stay organized like I have been at home.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, Yaya. What strategies do you think could help you stay organized once you return to school?

User: Maybe I could keep using a planner for my assignments and try to build study groups with my friends.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Using a planner can really help you keep track of your assignments and working with friends can make studying more enjoyable. How do you think you can maintain your positive mindset during those busy school days?

User: I think I’ll remind myself to take breaks and not be too hard on myself if something doesn’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Allowing yourself breaks and practicing self-compassion when things don’t go as planned can be very beneficial. How do you feel now about your ability to face the challenges ahead?

User: I feel more capable and hopeful. I know I can use the tools we talked about.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Yaya! As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to celebrate the progress you’ve made. What do you consider your biggest achievement during our sessions?

User: I think it’s being able to communicate my worries better and understanding that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Recognizing the importance of communication and seeking support is a powerful skill. What tools do you think you can use to continue managing your feelings as you move forward?

User: I can keep journaling my thoughts and perhaps talk to someone when I feel down, instead of keeping everything to myself.

Consultant: Those are fantastic tools, Yaya! Journaling can be a great way to process your feelings, and reaching out for support shows strength. As we conclude today’s session, remember that you’ve made tremendous strides, and you have the skills to manage whatever comes next. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help and support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yaya! Remember, you can always reach out if you need help in the future. Take care, and I wish you all the best as you continue on this journey.
