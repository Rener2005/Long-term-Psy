Consultant: Hello, Xiaow! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to start by just checking in on how you've been feeling lately. Can you share a bit about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty uneasy. Ever since I started thinking that someone is following me on my way home from school, I can't shake the feeling. It's affecting my sleep and how I feel during the day.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaow. Feeling like someone is following you can be really unsettling and it's understandable that it would lead to sleepless nights and anxiety. Let's take a moment to explore those feelings. What thoughts go through your mind when you have that sensation?

User: I just keep worrying that I might be in danger. It's like there's this constant knot in my stomach, and I can’t relax. Sometimes, I even think that I’m just being silly, but it still scares me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared in that kind of situation. You aren't being silly at all—your feelings are valid. When you think about being in danger, do these thoughts lead to any specific feelings or bodily sensations for you?

User: Yeah, I get really tense and my heart races. It’s like my body is on high alert all the time, even when I'm at home, which makes it hard to sleep.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like your body is responding strongly to your thoughts of danger, making it difficult for you to feel safe, even in familiar places. Can you remember any times when you felt safe and relaxed? 

User: Sometimes when I’m playing games with my brother, I forget about everything else. But it doesn’t last long, and then I start feeling anxious again.

Consultant: That's good to hear that you have moments of happiness with your brother, even if they are brief. We can look for ways to make those moments last longer, especially when you're feeling anxious. Have you tried anything to help you feel more secure when you're on your way home?

User: Not really. I just try to walk faster, but it doesn't help much. I just want to go back to feeling safe again.

Consultant: It's a great first step that you've identified what you want to feel—safe. Let's explore some ideas together. What if we started by working on some relaxation techniques that could help calm your mind and body when you're feeling anxious?

User: I’d like that, but I’m not sure how to do it. I always feel too worked up to think clearly.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay, Xiaow. We can practice some simple breathing techniques together. For instance, you can try taking a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, holding it for a count of four, and then breathing out through your mouth for a count of four. Would you like to try it now?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a shot. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it together. Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… Now hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit calming, but I still feel tense thinking about everything.

Consultant: It’s a start, and that’s perfectly fine! It will take time to ease those feelings. We can also work on facing those fears gradually. What do you think about maybe trying to identify what makes you feel safe in your surroundings?

User: I could try that. Maybe if I pay more attention when I walk home, it might help me feel more secure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being aware of your environment can help ground you and regain a sense of control. You could even make a list of things or places that make you feel safe. How does that sound for you?

User: That sounds doable. I can write about it when I get home.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing can be very helpful. I also encourage you to share your feelings with your family. Although it might feel a bit daunting, they could offer support. How do you feel about opening up to them?

User: I want to, but it’s scary. I don’t want them to worry too much.

Consultant: I understand your concern. It’s normal to feel worried about how others will react. However, sharing your feelings can actually help them support you better. Maybe you could start with just one family member, like your brother. What do you think?

User: That seems less scary. I might try talking to him first.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaow. You’re taking steps toward feeling more secure and supported. Remember, you don’t have to navigate this alone. We can keep working on these strategies together. 

User: Thank you. It helps to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. You’re showing a lot of courage in facing these feelings. Just take it one step at a time, and remember it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. 

User: I’ll try to remember that. 

Consultant: For our next session, let’s discuss how your practice with breathing and talking to your brother went. I believe these small steps will help build your confidence and sense of safety. 

User: Sounds good! 

Consultant: Great! You’ve done really well today, Xiaow. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress when we meet again. Remember, it’s okay to take your time with this.

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’ll see you next time. Take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hi there, little W! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've felt a bit better. I managed to talk to my grandparents a little more, but I still find it hard to open up completely. 

Consultant: That’s a great step, W! It's important that you’re trying to share more with your grandparents. Can you tell me what makes it hard for you to open up completely?

User: I guess I’m worried they won’t understand or that I’ll just make them sad. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way; many people worry about how their feelings might affect others. Let's explore that a bit more. What specific feelings do you think might make your grandparents sad?

User: I mainly feel lonely and a bit scared. Sometimes, it just feels like no one really understands me.

Consultant: Feeling lonely and scared is tough. It’s good that you’re starting to recognize these emotions. When you're feeling this way, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I’m just a burden to them, that they have their own life and don’t want to deal with my problems. 

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. Let's challenge that thought together. Do you have any evidence that your grandparents see you as a burden? 

User: I guess not really. They always try to help me, but I just feel guilty about it.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your grandparents' efforts to support you. Sometimes, our minds can trick us into thinking we’re a burden. What if you thought about how your grandparents might feel if you shared your feelings with them instead?

User: I think they would probably want to know. They care about me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Communication can really help strengthen your connection. What’s one thing you’d consider sharing with them that feels a bit easier to start with?

User: Maybe I could tell them about my bad dreams. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good start. Sharing about your dreams can help them understand what you’re going through. How do you think they would react when you tell them?

User: I think they would be concerned but also want to help me feel better. 

Consultant: That’s a positive thinking! Would it help if we practiced how you might start that conversation?

User: Yeah, that could help. 

Consultant: Let’s role-play a little. You can start by saying, “I want to share something that has been bothering me.” How does that sound to you?

User: Okay. I’ll try. “I want to share something that has been bothering me...” 

Consultant: Great job, W! Now, what would you say next about your bad dreams?

User: I’d say I keep having dreams that make me feel scared when I wake up. 

Consultant: That’s perfect. It’s honest and opens the door for them to talk about it. How do you feel about this practice?

User: I feel a bit less scared, maybe a little more ready to try.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it's completely okay to feel nervous, but taking that step is courageous. How about your social interactions at school? Are there moments you’ve felt lonely there too?

User: Yeah, sometimes I feel left out during recess. My classmates are having fun, and I just sit there.

Consultant: That sounds really isolating. It’s hard to feel left out. Have you thought about ways you might approach joining in with them?

User: I want to, but I’m afraid they won’t want me around. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way. What if you considered that they might be welcoming if you gave it a chance? What could be a small step you could take to try interacting with them?

User: I could maybe ask to join a game next time I see them playing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Even just asking can open the door to that connection. If you do that, how would it make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel more brave, even if they say no. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step, regardless of the response, is a great achievement. Remember, every step counts. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and a little more ready to talk about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, W! Reflecting on your feelings is really important, and every little progress counts. I’m proud of you! Remember, you can always come back and share your experiences with me.

User: Thank you! I will keep trying! 

Consultant: You're welcome, W! I’m here to support you. Let’s continue working together on this journey next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, little W! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I still feel a bit lonely, even though I tried to join some activities at school. I thought it would help, but it’s still hard for me to connect with others.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you made a brave step by joining those activities, even though it didn’t turn out the way you hoped. Can you tell me more about what made you feel lonely during those activities?

User: Well, I tried to talk to some classmates, but it seemed like they were really busy and didn't notice me much. I felt like an outsider.

Consultant: I can understand how frustrating that must be for you. Feeling like an outsider can be really tough, especially when you’re trying to fit in. What do you think could help you feel more included next time?

User: Maybe if I try to talk to them first? But I'm not sure what to say, and I get nervous.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It can be nerve-wracking to start conversations, but let’s break it down a bit. What are some things you enjoy talking about that could help spark a conversation?

User: I like drawing and reading. I could ask if they like those too.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Asking about shared interests can be a good way to start a conversation. What do you think would be a good opening question about drawing or reading?

User: Maybe I could ask if they’ve read any good books lately or if they like to draw too.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a nice, friendly question. It shows your interest in them while also sharing something about yourself. How do you think you would feel preparing to ask that question next time?

User: I feel a bit better thinking about it, but I still worry they might not want to talk to me.

Consultant: It’s totally normal to have those feelings. Remember, not every conversation has to go perfectly. Sometimes just starting is a success in itself. How about we practice that question together? 

User: Okay, let’s try!

Consultant: Great! I’ll pretend to be one of your classmates. You can start the conversation when you’re ready.

User: Um, hey! Have you read any good books lately?

Consultant: Oh, yes! I just finished a really interesting fantasy book. How about you? What do you like to read?

User: I like adventure stories! I just finished one about a girl who goes on a treasure hunt.

Consultant: That sounds exciting! Adventure stories can be so much fun. How did you feel about the ending?

User: I thought it was kind of surprising! I liked it a lot.

Consultant: You did great! How did it feel to respond in that conversation?

User: It felt nice! I think I could really ask that in real life.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing can really boost your confidence. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. Would you feel comfortable setting a goal to try this out in your next activity?

User: Yes, I want to try! I’ll ask that question.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It sounds like you’re developing the skills to approach social situations. How do you think you can take care of yourself if things feel overwhelming?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths or step outside for a moment.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking a break and breathing can help you feel more grounded. Just remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. It’s okay to feel nervous; what’s important is that you’re trying.

User: Yeah, I’ll remind myself of that.

Consultant: I’m so proud of you for being proactive about your feelings. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you’re looking forward to trying in your next social activity?

User: I’m looking forward to asking about books and hopefully making new friends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! It sounds like you’re ready to take steps into socializing more comfortably. When we meet next time, I can’t wait to hear how it went. Just remember that every small step is progress.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more excited now.

Consultant: You’re welcome, W! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, I’m here to support you. Keep practicing, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, little W! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to talk to my classmates more, but sometimes I still feel nervous. I felt a bit proud when I managed to speak to someone at school, but it's still hard for me.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you made an effort to connect with your classmates! Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you share more about how you felt during that interaction?

User: Well, I was really nervous at first, but when I actually talked to my classmate, it felt nice. I guess it was just that initial fear that made it tough.

Consultant: That initial fear can really hold us back, can't it? It sounds like you experienced a bit of success, even in the face of that fear. What thoughts went through your mind while you were speaking to your classmate?

User: I kept thinking that they might not want to talk to me or that I’d say something silly. But once we started chatting, it wasn’t as bad as I thought.

Consultant: It's interesting how our thoughts can create barriers. It sounds like you had some unhelpful beliefs, like thinking your classmate wouldn't want to engage with you. Do you think those thoughts were realistic in the moment?

User: Maybe not... I mean, they ended up talking to me, so they must have wanted to! 

Consultant: Exactly! You challenged those unhelpful beliefs by taking action and it led to a positive experience. If you find yourself thinking similar thoughts next time, what could you remind yourself?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that talking to people can actually be fun!

Consultant: That's a fantastic reminder! Recognizing that it's okay to feel nervous and that conversations can lead to enjoyable moments is key. What about your family? How have they supported you during this time?

User: They always encourage me to be brave and tell me that it’s okay to take my time. I do feel nice when they say that.

Consultant: Family support can truly make a difference. It's wonderful that your family is there for you! How do you think their encouragement affects your confidence in social situations?

User: I think it helps a lot. When they tell me to try new things, I feel like I can at least attempt it without being too hard on myself.

Consultant: That's a constructive attitude! Feeling that support allows you to be more gentle with yourself. Have you considered ways you can keep tapping into that family support when you’re feeling uncertain?

User: Maybe I can talk to them about how my day went and share my feelings more. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your experiences with your family can be a great way to process your feelings and gain reassurance. How about planning a time to share your successes or worries with them? 

User: I think I will! It's good to talk to them. It makes me feel lighter.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization! Talking and expressing can indeed lighten our emotional load. As we close today’s session, what strategies do you think will help you in your social interactions moving forward? 

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to be nervous, and that I can always count on my family for support. And maybe I can practice talking with them more.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, little W! Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Continue drawing strength from your family and feel free to embrace the nervousness—you are doing wonderfully. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I will try to practice and share with my family more often.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, little W! I'm glad you're here today. It's wonderful to hear that your family has been supportive. Can you tell me more about how that support has made you feel recently?

User: Hi! I feel better because my family listened to me at the gathering. They understood how I felt scared on my way home from school. It made me feel like I'm not alone.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like sharing your feelings with your family helped you feel less isolated. How do you think you can keep this communication open with them in the future?

User: I think I can try to talk to them more often, maybe after dinner. It would be nice to share what happens at school.

Consultant: Talking after dinner sounds like a wonderful idea! Regular check-ins can help strengthen your bond. What specific things would you like to share about your day or school experiences during those times?

User: Maybe I can talk about what I learned or if I had a tough day. I would also like to share if I have those panic feelings again.

Consultant: Sharing both positive and challenging experiences can create a supportive space for you. How do you feel about expressing those panic feelings to your family if they come up again?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it. What if they don’t understand?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous. One way to help is by explaining what you experience during those moments. You could say something like, “When I feel panic, it feels like…” This might help them understand you better. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I could explain it like that. I just don’t want to burden them.

Consultant: You’re not burdening them; you are providing them a chance to support you. Families often want to help, but they may not know how unless you share. It’s all about teamwork! Would you like to role-play how you might bring this up with them?

User: Yes, I’d like that! It might help me be less scared to talk.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re at the dinner table with your family. How would you start the conversation?

User: I could say, “Can I share something about my day?” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! What would you say next once they agree to listen?

User: I could say something like, “Sometimes on my way home, I feel really scared, and I don't know how to handle it.”

Consultant: That’s really brave, W. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I hope they would say something nice, like they understand or maybe ask me questions.

Consultant: Likely, they would want to support you and learn more. If they respond positively, how would you feel?

User: I’d feel relieved and not so alone with it anymore!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling to aspire to! What can you do to encourage this kind of understanding from them?

User: I could tell them how much their support means to me and that it helps me feel better.

Consultant: Expressing gratitude can really strengthen those connections. As you reflect on the support from your family, what differences do you notice in how you feel about school and social situations?

User: I feel a little more confident. I think I can try to talk to my classmates more now.

Consultant: That’s a promising sign! It seems like you're building confidence to engage with others. What’s one small step you can take next time you’re at school to practice this new confidence?

User: I could ask a classmate if they want to study together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Collaborating with others can help ease anxiety and make learning more enjoyable. How do you think this will impact your feelings about school and your connections there?

User: I think it would help me feel more connected and less scared about talking to others.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Making those small connections can really enhance your sense of belonging. Looking ahead, how can you keep reminding yourself of the support your family offers, especially during tough moments?

User: Maybe I can write down how I feel after talking to them. It might help me remember that they're there for me.

Consultant: Writing it down is a wonderful way to reinforce those positive feelings. Keeping a journal can also help you track your progress and feelings over time. Would you be open to trying this?

User: Yes, I think I will try journaling!

Consultant: Perfect! It sounds like you've made some valuable progress today, W. Remember, it's okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. Before we finish today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to hold onto from our conversation?

User: I want to remember that sharing my feelings can help and that my family is there for me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Holding onto that thought will empower you. As we conclude today's session, I encourage you to keep practicing that openness with your family and continue building those connections at school. You’ve made great strides, and I believe in you. Would you like to schedule our next meeting?

User: Yes, I’d like that! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, W! I'm proud of the progress you've made. I look forward to our next session to hear how things have been going for you. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, W! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing a lot better, actually. I started to enjoy school activities and feel more stable emotionally. But sometimes, I still worry about if I can keep this up.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more stable and enjoying school activities! It's completely normal to have some worries about maintaining your progress. Can you tell me more about those worries and what specifically makes you feel uncertain?

User: I guess I'm just afraid that if I stop being involved or something changes at home, I might fall back into feeling sad again. My parents are still far away, and I sometimes feel lonely without them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when your support system isn't always physically there. You’ve made significant improvements, which shows your strength. What do you think has helped you feel more positive lately?

User: I think being part of group activities at school has really helped. I’ve made a couple of friends, and it feels nice to have people to talk to.

Consultant: Friends can be a great source of support! It's good to hear that you have people to connect with. How do you think you can maintain these connections, even when you have those feelings of loneliness?

User: I could try to reach out to them more, maybe invite them over or join more school clubs. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging with friends and being part of social activities can help reinforce those positive feelings. Let's also think about how you can cope if you do start feeling sad again. Do you remember any techniques we've discussed that could help you handle those emotions?

User: Yes, I remember the breathing exercises and trying to talk about my feelings. I haven’t done it much lately because I’ve been feeling okay.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve been feeling okay! However, it’s also important to practice those techniques regularly so they’re there for you if you need them. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, I’d like that!

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Great! How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a little calmer. I think that really helps!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Regular practice can make a big difference. Now, let's reflect on your feelings about your parents being away. How do you usually cope with that?

User: Sometimes I just try not to think about it, but it makes me feel bad sometimes. I wish they were more involved in my life.

Consultant: It's natural to want your parents around, especially during significant moments. Have you had a chance to share your feelings with them?

User: Not really. It feels hard to talk about it. I think they are busy, and I don’t want to bother them.

Consultant: You’re not bothering them; they care about you very much. Communicating your feelings can help them understand how you’re doing. What might be a comfortable way for you to express this to them?

User: Maybe I could write them a letter or a message. That could be easier for me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Writing can really help express your feelings. If you do send them a message, what would you want them to know?

User: I want them to know that I miss them but that I’m doing better. I want them to feel okay about me not feeling so sad anymore.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By sharing your progress as well as your feelings, you not only keep them updated but also strengthen your bond. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it! I think it could actually help me feel closer to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that connection can often alleviate feelings of loneliness. Now that we’ve discussed some strategies, do you feel more confident in managing your emotions moving forward?

User: Yes, I do! I feel like I have more ways to cope if I start to feel down again.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Remember, you've built resilience by engaging in school and connecting with friends—these are fantastic resources. As we wrap up our session, let's summarize what you've achieved. How would you describe your progress since we started?

User: I think I’ve grown a lot! I’m more involved in school and have been feeling happier. I also learned to express my feelings more.

Consultant: You've made tremendous progress, W! It's important to acknowledge these achievements. How can you continue to build on this positive momentum in the coming weeks?

User: I can keep reaching out to my friends and maybe even talk to my parents. I want to keep feeling good!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember, you have the tools and support to navigate your feelings. As this session comes to an end, know that you can always reach out if you need further support. I believe in your ability to maintain this positive change. You’re doing great, W!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel really hopeful now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Stay hopeful and keep practicing those skills. Take care, W, and I look forward to our next session!
