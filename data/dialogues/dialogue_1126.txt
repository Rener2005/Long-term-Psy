Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I’m glad to see you here. Before we dive in, I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I’ve been really struggling with feeling down about myself. I often think I don’t have any good qualities, which makes me feel anxious, especially when I have to speak in front of others.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you're feeling quite overwhelmed by these feelings of self-doubt and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to speak in front of others?

User: Well, like last week in class, I tried to raise my hand to answer a question, but I just froze. I felt everyone was staring at me, and my mind went blank. I wished I could just disappear.

Consultant: I can sense how distressing that experience was for you. It’s tough to feel that way in a moment when you want to contribute. What thoughts were running through your mind right before you attempted to speak?

User: I remember thinking, "What if I say something stupid?" or "Everyone will judge me." Those thoughts really made me feel paralyzed.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging and can contribute to your anxiety. Let’s take a moment to examine those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you would say something stupid or that everyone would judge you?

User: I guess I don’t have any real evidence, but I just feel like I never say the right thing, especially compared to my peers who seem so confident.

Consultant: It’s understandable to compare yourself to others, however, those comparisons can often distort how we view ourselves. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them to think about in that situation?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that their thoughts aren’t necessarily true. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response. It seems like you recognize that those negative thoughts don’t tell the whole story. What might happen if you tried to adopt a friendlier perspective toward your own speaking abilities?

User: Maybe I could try to remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect and that everyone has their own struggles.

Consultant: Exactly! That shift in perspective could be very helpful. Let's consider setting some small, achievable goals for yourself when it comes to speaking in class. What might be a reasonable first step for you?

User: I think I could aim to share at least one thought during each class, even if it’s just a short comment.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on making even a small contribution can help ease your anxiety over time. How do you think you can prepare yourself before class to help you with this goal?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand or remind myself to take deep breaths before I speak.

Consultant: Practicing and breathing techniques can be wonderful strategies. How have you been feeling about participating in group activities since we last spoke?

User: I still feel a bit tense and anxious in those situations. I sometimes have the urge to speak, but I often back out.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Acknowledging that tension is already a step forward. Would you be open to recognizing those moments when you feel like speaking but hold back? That awareness is key to change.

User: Yes, I think being aware of those moments could help me tackle that anxiety.

Consultant: Great! You could also keep a journal to note down those instances along with any feelings that arise. This can deepen your understanding of your patterns. How do you feel about that idea?

User: That sounds helpful. I could see what triggers my feelings of anxiety more clearly.

Consultant: Fantastic! Tracking those triggers is a valuable step. How might it feel to gradually challenge yourself to speak during those moments of tension?

User: I think it would be scary at first, but it could be rewarding if I manage to do it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress often comes with some discomfort. Remember, each step you take, no matter how small, is significant. Any thoughts on how we can support you in that journey?

User: I guess having someone to talk to about my experiences would help. Just knowing that I have someone to share with makes it less daunting.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight. I’ll be here to support you through your journey. Remember, you’re not alone in this. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit relieved. Just talking about it makes me feel lighter.

Consultant: That's encouraging to hear! Let’s keep this momentum going. As we wrap up today, remind yourself that achieving your goals takes time and practice. You’re capable of making these changes.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. I’m looking forward to trying out the goals we set.

Consultant: I’m excited for you, too! Just take it one step at a time. If you feel the need for further support, don’t hesitate to come back. Take care of yourself!

User: I will, thank you!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I tried to speak during a group discussion last week, but my anxiety took over again, and I couldn’t express my thoughts. 

Consultant: I can sense your frustration. It’s tough when anxiety holds us back from sharing our ideas. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during that discussion?

User: I just felt so anxious the whole time. I thought everyone would judge my opinions, and I ended up staying quiet, even though I wanted to speak up.

Consultant: It sounds like fear of judgment was really impactful for you. If I may ask, what specific thoughts were you having about your opinions and how others would react?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas weren't good enough and that no one would care about what I had to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging. It's important to remember that everyone's contributions are valuable. How did those thoughts make you feel while you were in the discussion group?

User: I felt embarrassed and ashamed, which made me even more anxious. It’s like a cycle that keeps repeating, and I just can't break out of it.

Consultant: I see how this cycle can be quite exhausting. What do you think would happen if you were to challenge those negative thoughts? 

User: I’m not sure. They feel so real, like I can’t just ignore them. 

Consultant: That's understandable. Let’s explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that your ideas aren’t good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. It's more like a feeling. 

Consultant: Exactly, it often stems from feelings rather than facts. How would you respond to a friend who shared a similar concern about their opinions?

User: I would probably tell them that their ideas matter and they should give themselves more credit.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, how about we try to apply that same kindness and support to yourself? What would it look like for you to practice that self-encouragement?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has different perspectives and that it’s okay to express my own.

Consultant: Yes! Also, practicing positive self-talk can be really helpful. How might you frame a positive affirmation for yourself in relation to speaking up?

User: I could say, "My thoughts are valuable, and it's okay to share them." 

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! We can use that to counter the negative thoughts during discussions. Next, let’s consider some practical steps for your next group discussion. How about we create a structure for your contributions?

User: That would be helpful. I often feel lost when trying to express my thoughts.

Consultant: Let's outline a simple three-point structure. First, introduce your main idea. Then, support it with a reason or example, and finally, conclude or ask for feedback. How does that sound?

User: Okay, that makes sense. I could write it down before the next meeting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a written outline can reduce anxiety and give you confidence. In upcoming sessions, we can simulate discussions to make this less daunting. How do you feel about that?

User: I think practice will be really useful. I just hope I can overcome this anxiety.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel that way. Remember, progress comes with practice. What if we incorporate some gradual exposure techniques? For instance, you could start by sharing a brief comment or question in small groups before moving to larger ones.

User: Yes, that's a good idea. It feels less intimidating when I think about it that way.

Consultant: Great! In addition to that, let’s address the feeling of "brain freeze" that you mentioned before. We can practice techniques to manage that. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, what would those techniques be?

Consultant: One technique is to pause and take a deep breath to collect your thoughts. Another is to have a few key phrases ready that you can use whenever you lose your train of thought.

User: That sounds really helpful! I could practice that when I feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad you see value in it! So, as we wrap up our session, let's recap what you've learned today. What are some key takeaways?

User: I learned to challenge my negative thoughts, practice positive self-talk, and create a structured approach for my contributions.

Consultant: Excellent summary! I'm proud of you for recognizing these strategies. What do you think will be your first step to implement them in your next group discussion?

User: I think I’ll prepare my outline and practice my affirmation. I feel a little more confident about trying again.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Confidence takes time, but you’re making progress. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you can return to these strategies. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I hope to make real progress next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe you will. Let’s set up our next meeting to check in on your progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been struggling with a lot of self-doubt. I often feel like I don't have any good qualities, and this makes me avoid social situations. Recently, I participated in an extracurricular activity but felt really frustrated because I couldn't share my opinions.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been dealing with some heavy feelings of self-doubt and frustration. I appreciate you sharing your experience with the extracurricular activity. What do you think made it difficult for you to express your thoughts during that event?

User: I just felt like my opinions weren't valuable enough. There were so many smart people there, and I worried that what I said wouldn’t be good enough. This has made me hesitant to join in again.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way in a group where everyone seems knowledgeable. Let's explore this together. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment when you hesitated to speak up?

User: I thought maybe I should just listen instead, that it would be better than saying something stupid. But then I ended up feeling left out and even more critical of myself.

Consultant: I can see how that cycle of thinking would lead to feeling left out and increase your self-criticism. This is a pattern we can work on changing together. Can you think of any evidence that might contradict those negative thoughts about your opinions being unworthy?

User: Sometimes, friends tell me I have interesting insights, but I just brush them off. I guess I don’t believe them.

Consultant: It’s a step forward that you’ve noticed your friends' compliments. Let's hold on to that. If a friend told you that, how would you respond to them? 

User: I would probably tell them, "You’re too kind." I would try to dismiss it, just like I do for myself.

Consultant: That's a very common reaction, wanting to downplay compliments, but it can hinder your confidence. How about we practice thinking of those compliments as valid and recognizing their importance? 

User: That makes sense. I should probably try to accept them instead of dismissing them. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Acceptance helps in building your self-esteem. Let’s establish small goals for your next social interaction. What would you feel comfortable aiming for in terms of sharing your thoughts or opinions?

User: I think I could try to share at least one thought next time, even if I feel scared.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Sharing one thought is a significant step. How about writing down those little wins afterwards, too? This could help reinforce that positive behavior.

User: I like that idea. It could help me see my progress.

Consultant: Wonderful! Seeing your progress is key to building confidence. What are some situations or activities you might have coming up where you could put this into practice?

User: I have another group project starting soon, and we'll have several meetings. I guess I could try to voice my ideas there.

Consultant: Perfect! Group projects are excellent opportunities for collaboration and sharing. What do you think might happen if you try to share your opinions in those meetings?

User: Honestly, I'm scared it’ll go bad, but I think it might feel better than just sitting silently...

Consultant: It’s natural to feel scared of the outcome, but remember, trying is a success in itself. Even if it feels awkward at first, it’s a learning experience. What’s one positive outcome you can imagine from sharing your thoughts?

User: Maybe my group will appreciate my input, and it might make me feel more included.

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling included is a great motivation. Alongside this, how can you remind yourself to take things one step at a time during these interactions?

User: Maybe I can focus less on being perfect and just think about being part of the conversation, regardless of how things go.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent mindset shift! Perfection can be paralyzing. At the end of each meeting, you could reflect on your involvement, confirming that your participation matters.

User: I’ll definitely try that. Reflecting will help me keep track of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! It will reinforce your sense of accomplishment. As we wrap up, what do you feel is the main takeaway from today's session?

User: I feel like I need to practice accepting compliments and setting realistic goals for sharing my thoughts. It's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Embracing imperfection can truly liberate you. I'm encouraged by your readiness to engage in this process. Let’s keep building on this momentum in our future sessions. Remember, you're making progress!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about trying to be social again.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'll be here to support you as you navigate this journey. Don't forget to celebrate those small victories along the way. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about those?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling somewhat surprised, but also happy. My roommate gave me positive feedback about my participation in class discussions, which I didn't expect. I often doubt my abilities, so this was a nice change.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you're starting to notice the positive feedback. Can you share more about how that feedback made you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel a bit more validated, I guess. Even though I still struggle to believe I have any strengths, it felt nice to hear someone notice my efforts. 

Consultant: It sounds like that feedback really resonated with you. Recognizing that others see your efforts can be a significant boost to your self-worth. What do you think might be getting in the way of fully accepting this positive feedback?

User: I tend to focus more on my mistakes than on my successes. It’s hard for me to shift my perspective and see myself in a positive light consistently.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, and it's important to acknowledge that. Let’s explore that. Can you identify the specific thoughts you have about yourself when you focus on your mistakes?

User: Usually, I think that I’m not good enough or that I don’t measure up to others. I often compare myself to my peers, and it just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: Comparison can indeed be quite damaging to our self-esteem. Let's challenge these thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports those negative beliefs about yourself, and can you find evidence that contradicts them?

User: Well, I mean, it's true that I sometimes struggle in class, but on the other hand, I received that positive feedback from my roommate. It shows I'm making an effort, doesn’t it?

Consultant: Exactly! That positive feedback is significant. It highlights that you have strengths and that effort counts. If a friend were in your position, how might you help them view their strengths and acknowledge their progress?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their achievements and remind them that everyone makes mistakes. I guess I could apply the same advice to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Giving yourself the same kindness you’d offer a friend is so important. Let’s set a goal for this week: could you jot down a couple of your successes, no matter how small, alongside any negative thoughts that come up?

User: I can definitely try that. It might help me see things more balanced. 

Consultant: Absolutely! This practice can enhance your awareness of your strengths over time. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. What do you think you'll write down first?

User: Maybe I’ll start with participating in class discussions and the positive feedback I got. That feels like a good starting point.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! By recognizing those moments, you help reinforce your self-worth. How do you feel about openly sharing these successes with someone, like your roommate or friends?

User: I’ve never really shared my feelings of self-doubt before, but I think it could be helpful. I might feel more connected if I did.

Consultant: That’s a courageous step! It can really strengthen the bonds you have with others. Just remember, being vulnerable can sometimes lead to deeper relationships. 

User: I see that. I’ve often kept my feelings to myself which maybe makes me feel more isolated.

Consultant: Acknowledging that feeling is an important step. You’re not alone in this. Let’s also brainstorm some social situations you could engage in where you can practice this connection. Any ideas?

User: Maybe joining a club or participating in group study sessions could be helpful. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Taking small steps towards engaging with others can further enhance your confidence. You might even find that many people share similar feelings.

User: That’s true. I think I’ll look into a reading club since I love reading. 

Consultant: A reading club sounds like a fantastic way to meet people and share your interests! Would you feel comfortable committing to that this week?

User: Yes, I’m excited to try it out. It feels good to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s recap what we’ve discussed today. We talked about accepting positive feedback, challenging negative thoughts, and taking steps to engage socially. 

User: Yes, it feels like I’m gaining tools to deal with my self-doubt. 

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, progress takes time. As you keep acknowledging your achievements and connecting with others, your confidence will continue to grow. 

User: Thank you for all your help. This was really beneficial. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you're making strides, and I'm here to support you as you continue this journey. If you ever need to share or revisit these feelings, don’t hesitate to come back. 

User: I will. Thanks again. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: So am I! Take care, and I can't wait to hear about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately after your recent experiences?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite a bit better, actually. I received some praise from my teacher for my presentation, which really boosted my confidence. It’s a nice change from how I've been feeling recently.

Consultant: That sounds really encouraging! It's wonderful to hear that your teacher's praise helped boost your confidence. Can you tell me how that experience made you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel like maybe I do have some strengths after all. I’ve been struggling with self-doubt and thinking that I don’t have any good qualities, but this felt like a step in the right direction.

Consultant: It's great that you're starting to recognize your strengths. Acknowledging those positive feelings is an important part of overcoming self-doubt. What specific qualities or skills do you think helped you in that presentation?

User: I think I was able to explain my points clearly and engage with the audience. I felt prepared, and that made a difference. I wish I could carry this confidence into other situations too.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. You prepared well and engaged the audience, which contributed to your success. Since you want to carry that confidence to more social situations, can you think of a specific situation where you’d like to apply those skills next?

User: Maybe during group projects or social events. I often feel anxious in larger groups, and it can be hard to contribute.

Consultant: It's natural to feel anxious in larger groups. Let’s explore that a bit more. What thoughts typically go through your mind when you find yourself in those social situations?

User: I often worry that I won’t be interesting or that people won't want to hear what I have to say. I feel like I should just blend in rather than stand out.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely create anxiety. It sounds like there's a fear of judgment or not being interesting enough. How do you feel when you think these thoughts?

User: I feel tense and embarrassed. I usually just end up staying quiet, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: I understand that it can be tough to face those feelings. Let's challenge those negative thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that what you say wouldn’t be interesting to others?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. It’s more just a feeling I have.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization! Often, our feelings can create a narrative that doesn’t reflect reality. If you were to take a step back, how might a friend view your contributions in those situations?

User: They would probably say I have interesting thoughts and ideas. I tend to be very enthusiastic about topics I care about, and I think that can engage others.

Consultant: Exactly! Enthusiasm is infectious, and it’s likely that others appreciate that about you. How can we build on this positive experience to help you feel more confident in future group settings?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of the praise I received and also think about how my enthusiasm can be a strength. Writing down my experiences might help too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Keeping a record of positive experiences can reinforce your confidence. Would you be willing to share that with me, so we can discuss how it’s helping you?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I could write down situations where I felt good about myself or received positive feedback.

Consultant: Perfect! We can review them together in our future sessions. It might also be helpful to identify specific strategies to use when you start feeling anxious in a group. Do you have any ideas for coping mechanisms?

User: I think taking deep breaths could help, and maybe reminding myself that I can contribute something valuable.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great tool to manage anxiety. Also, affirming your contributions can certainly help foster a more positive mindset. What about planning a small step to engage in a social situation soon? 

User: I could try to contribute at our next group meeting. It feels a bit daunting, but I think I should give it a shot!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! It’s a step that can help bridge the gap between your current experience and your desired outcomes. Remember to acknowledge every small win along the way.

User: Yes, I will! I’m feeling excited about putting this into practice. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that excitement! Let’s continue to build on this positive momentum over our sessions. What do you feel is the most important takeaway from today’s discussion?

User: I think it’s realizing that I can have a positive impact in social situations and that I shouldn’t underestimate my contributions.

Consultant: Excellent insight! Recognizing your strengths and potential impact on others will surely help boost your confidence. For our next session, please reflect on any experiences where you applied what we’ve discussed today.

User: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this process! It really helps to talk about it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s about taking each step at your own pace. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next meeting. 

User: Me too! Talk soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you again. I’m really looking forward to our session today. You've made some impressive strides recently, especially with organizing that gathering. How are you feeling about that experience?

User: Hi! Thank you! I actually felt really proud of myself for taking the initiative and being actively involved. It made me realize that I can have an impact on my peers, which is something I didn't think I was capable of before.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience has positively influenced your self-perception and social skills. Can you share more about how this has affected your feelings of self-worth?

User: It’s interesting, I think it made me feel like I do have some strengths. Before, I often felt like I didn’t have any qualities that stood out. Now, I’m starting to see that I can organize things and connect with others, which feels good.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing your abilities! Building on that, how do you see these new insights affecting your future interactions and goals?

User: I hope to be more proactive in social situations. I want to keep organizing events and maybe even join a club or something to further push myself out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in clubs can really enhance social skills and also expand your network. What steps do you think you could take to initiate this process?

User: I think I could start by looking for clubs that interest me. I might also reach out to friends to see if they want to join me. That way, I won’t feel so alone in the process.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! It’s always great to have support while trying something new. How does that prospect of joining a club make you feel?

User: It’s a bit nerve-wracking but also exciting. I’m scared I might not fit in, but I also feel like it could be really rewarding.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of nerves and excitement. Remember, many people share those feelings when starting something new. How can you remind yourself of the positive experiences you've had, like with the gathering, when you feel anxious about joining?

User: I could keep a journal of my experiences and achievements. It would help me reflect on the positive moments instead of just focusing on my fears.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! A journal can be a powerful tool to reinforce your progress and self-acknowledgment. How do you envision using it regularly?

User: Maybe I could write in it at the end of each week to summarize what I did and how I felt. I think seeing my progress written down will motivate me to keep going.

Consultant: I love that approach! Reflecting weekly will help you track your growth and remind you of your capabilities. As for your social goals, how do you plan to handle any setbacks or challenges you might face while pursuing these activities?

User: I suppose I should practice self-compassion and not be too hard on myself if things don’t go perfectly. Maybe I could even talk to you if I encounter difficulties.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Being kind to yourself will be vital in your growth journey. I’m here to support you whenever you face challenges. Looking back on our session today, what do you think has been your most significant takeaway?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I do have strengths and that it’s okay to take risks. I really want to focus on celebrating my wins, no matter how small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small victories is key to reinforcing your self-esteem. As we prepare to wrap up, how do you plan to implement the steps we discussed?

User: I’m going to start looking for clubs this week and write in my journal regularly. I want to stay proactive and keep building on my strengths.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I’m excited to see how these actions work for you. Remember, growth is a journey, and it’s great that you’re committed to it. Is there anything specific you want to focus on until our next session?

User: Just keeping myself in check and maintaining this positive mindset. I want to make sure I’m aware of my progress.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Keeping that awareness will help you stay motivated. Remember, I’m here for you, and you can reach out if you need any support. Thank you for today’s conversation!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: See you next time! Take care!
