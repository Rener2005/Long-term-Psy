Consultant: Hi! I'm really glad you could make it to this session today. I know you have been going through a tough time recently. Can you share more about your feelings since your cousin's passing?

User: Hi. It's been really hard. I feel completely lost and useless. My grades are slipping, and I can't seem to handle the pressure at all. I have trouble sleeping, and I get irritable easily. I also feel like I've been distancing myself from my friends.

Consultant: I can hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and disconnected. It sounds like there's a lot on your mind, especially with the expectations from your parents. Can you tell me how this situation has impacted your daily life or your studies?

User: I've been avoiding studying altogether because I'm afraid I'll fail. It's like I don't even want to try anymore. Sometimes, I just stare at my books and can't focus, and then I end up crying out of frustration.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed during such a difficult time. It seems that you're caught in a cycle of fear and frustration about your studies. What do you think would help you feel more in control of your situation?

User: I really want to feel like I can get back on track with my studies, but right now I just feel so anxious about everything, especially with my father’s high expectations hanging over me.

Consultant: That pressure can be really intense, and it makes sense to feel anxious about it. Let’s explore that a little further. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about not meeting those expectations?

User: I just keep thinking that I'm a disappointment, and that I should be doing better. It’s like I can’t escape from those thoughts.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be heavy to carry. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of negative self-beliefs. Can you think of any specific situations when those thoughts become stronger?

User: Well, when I see my classmates performing well, I instantly compare myself to them and feel worse. It feels like I’m failing at everything.

Consultant: That comparison can be really discouraging. I wonder, are there moments when you’ve achieved something, even if it feels small, that you might overlook during these comparisons?

User: I did manage to pass my last exam, even if it was just barely. But I hardly celebrated that achievement because I was so focused on what I thought I should have done.

Consultant: That’s a great reminder! Passing that exam is an achievement, and celebrating it is important. Let’s try to challenge the thought that you're failing at everything. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you can succeed, even if it's not at the level you expect?

User: I guess I did put in the effort, and I have had small successes before. I just don’t see it that way when I’m feeling low.

Consultant: That makes sense. During tough times, it can be hard to appreciate our efforts. How about we explore some strategies to help you recognize those small successes regularly? 

User: That sounds helpful. I could use reminders of what I’ve accomplished instead of just focusing on what I haven’t.

Consultant: Great! Maybe keeping a journal to note down your small wins could help. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I like that idea. Writing it down might make it easier to see my progress, even if it feels small.

Consultant: Absolutely! And as you reflect on your feelings and progress, let’s also think about how to tackle those feelings of isolation. What could be a first step to reconnect with your classmates?

User: I think maybe I could join a study group. I’ve been too shy to ask anyone before, but it could help.

Consultant: Joining a study group could be a great way to both connect with others and support your studies. What do you feel when you think about taking that step?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also hopeful. I know I need to make changes, but part of me is scared of reaching out.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about making that first move. How can you approach this in a way that feels manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could start by talking to just one person I feel somewhat comfortable with. It doesn't have to be a big group right away.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart plan—start small and see how it feels. And remember, it’s okay to feel uncomfortable at first. With practice, it can get easier. 

User: Right. I really appreciate your support. Thinking about these strategies makes me feel a little more at ease.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about and set a couple of specific actions for you to take before our next session.

User: Okay! I want to start that journal and reach out to at least one classmate.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping a journal and building connections are excellent steps. Let's also plan to discuss what worked for you in our next session. How are you feeling about this plan?

User: I feel more hopeful and motivated. Thank you for helping me see things differently today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, I’m here to support you, and you can do this. Take care until we speak again!

Consultant: Hello, Xi! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the new school environment?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious. I can't seem to fit in with my classmates, and it's making me feel even lonelier. I struggle to connect with others, and it makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of loneliness and anxiety about fitting in. It's understandable given the pressures of a new environment. Can you tell me more about your experiences with your classmates so far?

User: Well, I've noticed that I often find myself sitting alone during lunch, while others seem to chatter and bond easily. I feel like I'm invisible, and I worry that they don't want to include me at all.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling excluded and invisible. It might be helpful to explore what thoughts come to your mind in those moments. What do you think when you see others interacting without you?

User: I think things like "They would never want to be friends with me" or "I'm not interesting enough for them." Those thoughts just make me feel worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xi. Those thoughts sound quite harsh and can definitely add to your feelings of anxiety. Can you think of any evidence that challenges those thoughts? Is there a possibility that they might not be true?

User: I don’t know. I mean, I never really talk to them, so it’s hard to say if they’d want to know me. I guess I assume they wouldn’t like me.

Consultant: It's common to assume the worst when we're feeling anxious. What if we tried to reframe those thoughts? For instance, instead of thinking "I'm not interesting enough," could we say "I haven’t had the chance to show my interests yet”?

User: That makes sense. It feels a bit more positive. But what if they don’t like me even after I try?

Consultant: That's a valid concern, but remember that not everyone's opinions define your worth. If a friend of yours were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that they shouldn’t take it personally, and that it’s okay to keep trying to connect. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective for others—now let’s apply that to yourself. What small steps could you take to start engaging with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could start by saying hi to one person in class. I haven’t really tried to initiate anything yet.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Xi! Starting with a simple "hi" can be an approachable first step. How would that make you feel?

User: I think it might make me feel a bit more confident if I could just do that. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. Confidence can build over time with small actions. Let’s think about how you can prepare for that interaction. What might you say after the initial greeting?

User: I could ask about class assignments or mention something funny that happened in class. 

Consultant: Perfect! Those are great topics to initiate a conversation. How would you feel if someone responded positively to your greeting and conversation?

User: That would probably make me really happy and help me feel a bit more connected.

Consultant: That's a promising thought! As we discuss these strategies, it's essential to acknowledge your progress too. How have you felt about our conversation so far?

User: I feel relieved to talk about it. It helps to hear that I'm not alone in feeling anxious and that there are things I can do.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xi. Remember, taking these steps is a gradual process, and it's okay to feel nervous. Let's reflect on what's been helpful today. What do you think you’ll take away from our session?

User: I think I will focus on challenging my negative thoughts and try to take small steps to connect with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. It's a journey, and you're taking commendable steps forward. How do you think you will handle setbacks if they arise during this process?

User: I guess I can remind myself that it's okay to not succeed every time and that each attempt is still valuable.

Consultant: Definitely! Each attempt is a learning opportunity. I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. As we wrap up, what support do you think you might need moving forward?

User: Just knowing I can return to talk about it if I feel overwhelmed would be nice. 

Consultant: Absolutely, Xi! I’m here for you whenever you need support. You've shown great insight today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Do you have any final thoughts or feelings before we conclude our session?

User: Just feeling a bit more hopeful, I guess. Thank you for listening.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure talking with you. Remember, small steps lead to big changes. I'm excited for us to continue this journey together. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello Xi! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to have you here. How have you been feeling since our last talk about managing your academic pressure?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. Joining the study group has been tough for me. I just can't seem to fit in, and the pressure is just too much.

Consultant: It sounds like the study group is making you feel quite anxious and out of place. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming when you're in the group?

User: I often feel like I'm not as smart as the others. They all seem to understand the material better, and I worry that I’ll just drag them down.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Feeling inadequate compared to your peers can definitely heighten anxiety. When you feel this way, what kind of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I think things like, "I shouldn't be here," or "They'll think I'm dumb." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. It seems like they elevate your anxiety. Let's try to identify how those thoughts affect your emotions. How do you feel when you think you're not meant to be in the group?

User: I feel really anxious and embarrassed. Sometimes, I just want to leave the group completely.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel that way. Feeling anxious and embarrassed can lead to wanting to avoid situations that make you uncomfortable. Can we explore if there might be different ways to view your participation in the group?

User: I guess there could be, but I’m not sure how.

Consultant: What if we challenge the belief that you don't belong? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're dragging them down? 

User: Well, maybe I’m not as quick as them, but I do try to contribute at least.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like you are making an effort, which is important. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to think about their contributions?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay not to know everything, and that trying is what matters.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about being part of the group and participating at your own pace. What if you adopted that same understanding for yourself? How do you think that might affect how you feel in the study group?

User: Maybe I’d feel less pressure to be perfect and just focus on learning.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift in perspective. Let's also think about some practical steps. Are there small contributions you think you could make in the group that might help you feel more involved and comfortable?

User: I could try asking questions when I don’t understand something. It might help me engage more with the others.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Asking questions can definitely enhance your understanding and also show that you're engaged. How do you feel about trying that the next time you meet with the group?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can manage it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Let's also prepare for how you might handle any discomfort when it arises. Can we explore strategies to support you if you feel overwhelmed during the next session?

User: Sure, I think having a plan could help me feel more in control.

Consultant: How about we create a simple checklist of reminders? For example, you could remind yourself to take deep breaths, or to give yourself permission to contribute little by little.

User: I like that idea. Having a checklist sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! And remember, practicing these new ways of thinking and engaging in the group takes time. How would you rate your confidence in using these strategies next time?

User: I’d say maybe a 6 out of 10. I still feel uncertain.

Consultant: That's a solid starting point. It's okay to start where you are. We can work together to boost that confidence. What would help you feel more prepared for your next group session?

User: Maybe practicing my questions beforehand could give me some confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Preparing in advance can ease your anxiety and make you feel more ready to engage. Let's also talk about how you’ll celebrate any small successes—like asking a question or contributing during the session. 

User: I guess I could treat myself to something I enjoy afterward.

Consultant: Absolutely! A little reward goes a long way in reinforcing positive behavior. Before we wrap up, what do you feel is the most significant takeaway from our session today?

User: I think it's that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself and that it’s okay to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: That's a valuable lesson, Xi. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it’s perfectly okay to reach out for support. I'm proud of the steps you're taking! As we end our session, how can you remind yourself of these insights going forward?

User: I can jot them down in my planner so I see them every day.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping reminders visible can be very motivating. Thank you for sharing so openly today, Xi. It’s been wonderful to explore these feelings with you. I'm looking forward to our next session to see how you've applied everything we've discussed. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now, and I’ll definitely try to use these strategies.

Consultant: Hello, Xi! I'm glad to see you in today's session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about trying to connect with my classmates, but I still doubt my social skills. Sometimes I find myself worried that I'll embarrass myself in group settings.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some positive changes but still facing uncertainty about your social skills. Can you share more about these feelings and any specific situations that might have triggered them recently?

User: Yes, I've attended a few workshops and tried engaging with others, but during conversations, I often feel awkward, like I don't know what to say next. I worry that people might think I'm boring.

Consultant: I understand that feeling awkward can be quite challenging, especially when you're trying to connect with others. What thoughts come to mind when you find yourself feeling this way? What emotions do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: I usually think, "What if they find me boring?" or "I can't keep up with the conversation." This makes me feel anxious and sometimes makes me want to withdraw.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like these thoughts add to your anxiety and lead you to avoid social situations. Let's explore how realistic those thoughts might be. Do you have any evidence that supports or contradicts those beliefs about being boring?

User: Well, I guess when I've spoken to a couple of classmates, they seemed interested in what I had to say. But I often forget those moments when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: That's important to note! It seems like there are positive interactions you've had that contradict the belief that you're boring. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you advise them about these thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the positive interactions and not overthink things.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on those positive experiences can help counterbalance the anxiety you're feeling. Would you be willing to try reminding yourself of those moments when you start to feel anxious again?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I just need to find a way to catch myself in those moments.

Consultant: That's a great insight! We can also explore techniques to help you manage those anxious moments. Have you considered practicing some specific social skills or conversation starters that you can use in group settings?

User: I haven't really tried that yet, but it sounds like a useful idea. I think if I had a few things in mind, it might ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having some conversation starters can provide you with a sense of preparedness. Let's brainstorm a few topics or questions that feel comfortable for you. What are some activities or interests you could share about?

User: I enjoy reading and watching movies. I could mention something about a recent book I enjoyed, or ask others about their favorite movies.

Consultant: Those are excellent topics! Sharing your interests is a great way to open up conversations. How about we role-play a scenario where you introduce that topic to a classmate? 

User: That sounds a bit intimidating, but I’m willing to give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step forward, Xi! Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit anxious about this. Let’s practice it together—I'll be a classmate, and you can share your favorite book with me as if we were in a casual setting. 

User: Alright! Here goes... “Hey, have you read any good books lately? I just finished one that I really enjoyed.”

Consultant: That was a great start! It’s open-ended, which invites a discussion. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit weird at first, but I think if I actually did it in real life, it might get easier once I start talking.

Consultant: Absolutely! The first step is always the hardest. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become. Let’s consider implementing this in your upcoming classes or events. How do you feel about approaching someone with this starter?

User: I feel a bit more confident now, like I really could try it out next time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we work on these skills, it’s also important to reflect on your experiences afterward. How can you reinforce your positive feelings after trying this out?

User: I can remind myself of what went well and not focus so much on what didn’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xi. Thank you for being so open today. Before we wrap up, let's summarize what you feel you’ve learned about your social skills today.

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and that I already have positive interactions to build on. I also see that having a few conversation starters can help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! You’ve made significant progress today. Going forward, keep practicing those skills and remember to celebrate those positive experiences. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel much better! I’m looking forward to trying out these strategies. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xi! You’ve put in a lot of effort, and I'm confident you can build on this momentum. Remember, I'm here for you if you need further support. Looking forward to our next meeting!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xi! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, can you share how you've been feeling lately, especially after your volunteering experiences?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite optimistic lately. Participating in the volunteer activities gave me a sense of achievement and recognition, which is something I haven't felt in a while.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like those experiences really resonated with you. How do you think you can build on that positive feeling in your studies or daily life?

User: I'm not entirely sure. I guess I want to translate that confidence into my schoolwork. Sometimes I struggle to focus, and I worry about living up to my dad's expectations.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that pressure, especially with high expectations. Let's explore what specific aspects of your volunteering experience you found most empowering. What activities made you feel the most accomplished?

User: I enjoyed organizing activities for the kids and seeing them smile when they participated. It felt rewarding to contribute something positive.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly fulfilling! Helping and making a difference can really enhance self-esteem. Would it be helpful to think about how you can apply that same sense of contribution and organization to your study habits?

User: Yes, I think that could work. Maybe I could approach my study sessions like I did the volunteer activities—set goals and rewards for myself.

Consultant: Great idea! Setting goals and rewarding yourself can reinforce positive behaviors. What are some specific study goals you might want to set for yourself?

User: I could set a goal to study for two hours every day and then treat myself to a snack or some time on my phone afterward. 

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced plan. How do you feel about this strategy? Do you think it will help you manage your time better and reduce your anxiety?

User: I think it could help, but sometimes I worry if I will stick to it. What if I fail to follow through?

Consultant: It’s okay to have concerns about sticking to a plan. Those thoughts are common. What evidence do you have that makes you think you might fail? 

User: Well, in the past, I didn't always follow through with my study plans because I felt overwhelmed.

Consultant: Acknowledging that can be a great first step. Let's challenge that thought—what would you say to a friend who felt overwhelmed about a study plan? How would you encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them to take it one step at a time and remind them that it's okay to adjust their goals if they feel too much pressure.

Consultant: That's a kind approach! You can apply that same advice to yourself. It’s perfectly fine to adjust your goals based on how you're feeling. How does that perspective shift the way you feel about your study plan?

User: It makes me feel a bit lighter, like it's okay if I don’t hit every target right away. I can always reassess.

Consultant: Exactly! Flexibility can relieve some of the pressure. To help you stay motivated, could you think about how you'll celebrate small wins along the way?

User: I could write down my achievements in a journal. Sometimes I need to see my progress to remind myself that I’m doing well.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Documenting your journey can reinforce positive feelings and keep you on track. How does the idea of journaling make you feel about managing your studies moving forward?

User: It feels good to have a tangible way to recognize my efforts. I think I’ll try to do that.

Consultant: Excellent! So, to summarize, you’ll set daily study goals, reward yourself afterward, and keep a journal to track your progress. How confident do you feel about implementing this plan?

User: I feel more confident now. I believe I can do this!

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s great to see your enthusiasm. As we look to the future, what emotions do you think you'll experience as you continue with this plan?

User: I hope to feel proud of my progress and maybe even more relaxed about my studies.

Consultant: That’s a healthy outlook! Remember, emotions can be managed and understood. If you encounter challenges, reflecting on your experiences can provide valuable insights. 

User: Yes, I’ll remember that. I appreciate the support you’re giving me, and it really helps to talk about this.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Xi. It's been great working through this with you. Let’s plan to check in on your progress next time. Before we conclude, what strategies can you recall if you encounter anxiety again?

User: I could remind myself of my achievements, use my journal, and reach out to friends or family for support.

Consultant: Perfect! Those tools will serve you well. You’re developing a strong foundation for your emotional health. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel empowered and ready to take the next steps.  

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello Xi, I'm glad to see you today! You've made some progress in managing your emotions and adapting to university life. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve noticed some improvements in how I handle my emotions, and it’s great to see the positive changes in my life. But sometimes I still worry about maintaining this momentum.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xi! It's natural to have concerns about maintaining progress. Can you share with me what specific changes you've noticed in yourself during this time?

User: Well, I’ve been more open to talking with my classmates, which is a big step for me. I used to be really shy and hesitant to interact socially. I also feel more confident in my studies, and I'm managing my time a bit better now.

Consultant: Those are significant changes! Being more open and confident in social interactions can really enhance your university experience. How do you feel about these improvements? Are there moments when you still struggle?

User: Yes, there are moments when I feel anxious again, especially before group projects or exams. I want to keep moving forward, but that anxiety sometimes holds me back.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re aware of your anxiety and want to overcome it. Could you tell me what thoughts cross your mind when you start feeling anxious in those situations?

User: I often think that I will mess up in front of others or that I’ll be judged for my performance. These thoughts create a lot of pressure on me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. It’s understandable that they would make you feel anxious. Let’s explore those thoughts together. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you will mess up or be judged?

User: I don’t really know. I guess I can’t be sure that others are thinking those negative things about me. Most of the time, they seem supportive, but my mind just jumps to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to sway towards the worst outcomes, especially under stress. If a friend were experiencing these thoughts, what would you advise them to think differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own struggles. I wouldn’t want them to be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective, Xi! Applying that kind of advice to yourself can also be helpful. Let's think about how we can challenge those anxiety-provoking thoughts. Would you be willing to try reframing your thoughts before your next exam or presentation?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. It would be nice to approach it more positively.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Let’s come up with some alternative thoughts you can tell yourself when those worries arise. What could be a more balanced way to think about your performance?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I've prepared well and that it’s normal to feel a bit nervous. I have friends who will support me, too.

Consultant: Absolutely! These reminders can help shift your focus and reduce anxiety. As we continue, let’s also explore some activities that make you feel good. Have you done anything recently that brought you joy?

User: I went out with some friends last weekend, and it was really fun! We went to a café and just chatted—it felt great to relax and enjoy their company.

Consultant: That sounds lovely! Engaging in enjoyable activities can really help balance out stress. How can we incorporate more of these positive experiences into your routine moving forward?

User: I think I should plan regular catch-ups with friends. Maybe setting up a study group would also help keep me motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Balancing your studies with social interactions can support both your academic progress and emotional well-being. Before we wrap up today, let’s briefly discuss your growth. How do you feel about where you are now compared to when we first started?

User: I feel like I’ve come a long way! I’m more aware of my feelings and how to manage them. I still have challenges, but I feel more equipped to face them.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! You have made great strides. As we finish today’s session, let’s consider some strategies to maintain your progress. What strategies can you use if you encounter those anxious thoughts again?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of my positive experiences and lean on my friends. I can also practice those reframed thoughts we discussed.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xi! Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs, and you’re not alone in this journey. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. If you ever feel the need, we can explore more strategies together in the future. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more motivated to keep going.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xi! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. Keep building on your strengths, and remember that I’m here if you need to talk again. Take care!

User: Bye!
