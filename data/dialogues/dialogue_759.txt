Consultant: Hello there, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling since we last met. What’s been on your mind recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed with school work. I thought I could handle the transition, but I just find everything so difficult, especially with English and math. I also started playing a lot of online games during the break, and honestly, it's the only thing that makes me feel good right now.

Consultant: I hear you, Zhao. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure from school and that gaming has become a way for you to escape those feelings. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes schoolwork seem difficult for you?

User: I guess it’s because I used to be good at my studies back in my old school. Now, I feel lost in class, and everyone seems to understand things much faster. I miss feeling confident in my abilities.

Consultant: It's totally understandable to miss that feeling of confidence, especially when you’ve had success in the past. Let's explore those feelings a bit. When you sit down to study or do your homework, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I usually think that I’ll never be able to catch up or that I’m just not smart enough anymore. It makes me want to give up even before I start.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and discouraging, Zhao. It’s important to recognize how they influence how you feel about studying. If a friend of yours were in the same situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I would tell them to keep trying and not give up, and that it’s okay to ask for help. But when it’s me, I just feel like it’s hopeless.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. You know, it’s okay to ask for help too, and there are ways to challenge those negative beliefs you have about yourself. For instance, what evidence do you have that you can’t learn or improve your skills?

User: I don’t really have any evidence, but I just feel that way. Like when I try to study, I barely remember anything and it’s frustrating.

Consultant: Frustration can definitely cloud our judgment. Let's look at this together. Have there been times when you were able to learn something new, even if it felt tough at first?

User: Well, I did improve in soccer. At first, I was terrible, but I kept practicing and got better.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great example. You showed persistence in soccer. What if you approached your studies with the same mindset? Could we think of small steps you could take to rebuild your confidence in learning?

User: Maybe I could start with just one subject a day instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable plan! Focusing on one subject will help you not feel overwhelmed. Which subject would you like to start with this week?

User: Maybe I’ll try with English first, since it’s the toughest for me. But I’m still worried I won’t understand anything.

Consultant: It's normal to feel worried, but remember, it's okay to not get everything right away. We can break down your English study into smaller parts too. Would you be willing to set aside a specific time each day this week to study just a little bit of English?

User: Yeah, I can try to set aside half an hour every day. But what if I get distracted by games?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. How about we identify specific strategies to help you stay focused during those study times? Maybe turning off notifications or using a timer could help?

User: Yeah, turning off notifications sounds good. I can try that! 

Consultant: Great idea! This way, you can create a distraction-free environment. Also, let’s think about some ways to reward yourself after studying. What do you think would help you feel accomplished after your study session?

User: Maybe I could allow myself to play games for a little while afterward if I finish my study goals.

Consultant: That sounds like a fair balance! Setting those rewards can help reinforce your efforts in studying. It gives you something to look forward to. Would you like us to set some specific study goals for your English this week?

User: Sure! I think I want to focus on vocabulary and reading comprehension. 

Consultant: Let’s set a goal of learning five new words each day and reading a short story or article. Afterward, you could summarize what you read. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable! I think I can handle that.

Consultant: Awesome! Remember, it’s all about taking small, manageable steps. How are you feeling about your ability to tackle your studies now, compared to when we started?

User: I feel a bit better. I’m still a little nervous, but it’s nice to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s a great improvement, Zhao! Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially with change involved. The important part is that you’re taking action. Is there anything else you want to talk about today?

User: I just hope I can stick to this plan and not get sucked back into gaming too much.

Consultant: That’s a fair concern. We can keep checking in on your progress so you feel supported. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re already making steps toward what you want. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate that.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Just remember that I’m here for you. We’ll work through this together, step by step. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time! 

User: Me too! See you next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Zhao. Before we start, I want to check in on how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with your studies and gaming situation.

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to cut down on my gaming time, but it's really hard. I feel overwhelmed with my studies, especially in English and math. It's frustrating because I used to be good at school.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure, especially after moving to a new school. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed; can you tell me more about what specific challenges you’re facing in your studies?

User: Well, I don’t understand the math problems as easily as I used to, and English is really tough too. My classmates seem to grasp things quickly while I’m still struggling. It makes me feel like I can’t catch up.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Zhao. It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're facing challenges and not seeing the same success as before. Let’s explore how this is affecting you emotionally. What thoughts come to your mind when you struggle with your studies?

User: I often think I'm just not smart enough anymore and that I’ll never be as good as my classmates. Those thoughts make me feel really hopeless.

Consultant: I can see why those thoughts would lead to feelings of hopelessness. It’s important to recognize these automatic thoughts. Let’s try to break them down. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are not smart enough? 

User: I guess I don’t have any solid proof. It’s just how I feel when I compare myself to others.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially when we compare ourselves to others. You’ve mentioned having been a good student in the past. What if you thought about times when you felt confident in your abilities? Can you identify moments that contradict your current belief?

User: There were times when I really enjoyed reading and even helped my friends with their studies. I used to feel proud of that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Those experiences show you have the ability to succeed and help others. Instead of focusing on the current struggles, let’s think about how we can build on those past successes. How about setting small, achievable goals related to your studies?

User: That might work. I guess setting smaller goals could help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Exactly! Small goals can make a big difference. What’s one specific goal you’d be comfortable setting for your studies this week?

User: Maybe I could aim to read one chapter in English and practice a few math problems every day?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By focusing on just one chapter and a few problems each day, you’re giving yourself manageable tasks. How do you think achieving these goals will affect your feelings about school?

User: I think it would help boost my confidence a bit if I actually managed to do them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each small success can help rebuild your confidence. Now, let’s discuss your interest in football. How do you feel about using it as a way to gain some stress relief and achievement?

User: I love football! I used to play a lot back home. It always made me feel good.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Football can be a great way to take a break from studies while also giving you a sense of achievement. Would you be open to setting a goal to engage in football practice alongside your study goals?

User: Yes, I think that would be fun! I could practice a few times a week.

Consultant: Fantastic! Balancing your studies with something you enjoy, like football, can really help improve your overall emotional well-being. How do you think engaging in football will impact your motivation toward studying?

User: I think having something fun to look forward to might make studying feel less like a chore.

Consultant: Exactly! A little balance can change your perspective on both studying and football. As we work toward your study goals and enjoy football, let’s also keep an eye on how you are feeling. You’re making great progress—would you like to share how you feel about the changes you’re working on?

User: I feel more motivated than before. I think focusing on both my studies and football will help me find a better balance.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It's all about balance and finding joy in both areas. You’ve come a long way, and I believe you’ll continue to improve. Before our next session, let’s reflect on your experience with these changes. How about noting down your achievements, big or small, related to your study and football practice?

User: Sure, I can do that!

Consultant: Wonderful! We’ll review your progress next time and see what worked well for you. Remember, it's completely okay to seek further support if you feel overwhelmed again. You are making strides in the right direction. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! I’m proud of the steps you are taking, and I look forward to hearing about your achievements next time. Keep lightening the load, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today, Zhao. It's great to hear that you've shown interest in football training lately. How have things been going with that?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been enjoying football. It makes me feel good to be part of a team, and I like learning new skills. But I still find it hard to focus on my studies.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're finding joy in football and enjoying being part of a team. Balancing your studies with your new interest can be tricky. Can you share more about what you're feeling when you try to study?

User: I feel overwhelmed and distracted. Sometimes, I just want to play games instead. But I don't want my grades to drop, either. It's like I'm stuck between two worlds.

Consultant: I understand—it sounds like you're finding it challenging to manage both your enthusiasm for football and your responsibilities at school. What do you think would help you feel more motivated to study without losing your interest in football?

User: Maybe having a better plan for my time could help? If I can structure my day, I might find that I have time for both. But I often forget about my plans and just go back to gaming.

Consultant: A time management plan sounds like a good idea! It can help you structure your day and remind you of your priorities. Can you describe what a balanced day would look like for you, including time for studying and football?

User: I think I could study for a couple of hours after school, then have football practice in the evening. I could set a specific time for gaming too, maybe only after I finish my study goals.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhao! By assigning specific times to study, practice football, and relax with games, you might find it easier to stay focused on each activity. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I guess if I stick to a routine, it might help me not get sidetracked so easily.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling more hopeful! Establishing a routine can really make a difference. How confident do you feel about sticking to this routine once you create it?

User: I think if I write it down somewhere and keep it visible, I’ll remember it better. I just need to stay disciplined.

Consultant: Writing it down is a fantastic idea! Keeping your plan visible can serve as a consistent reminder. We could also think about some strategies to help you stay disciplined. What do you think might motivate you to follow through with your schedule?

User: Maybe setting small rewards for myself after studying would work. Like, if I complete my goals for the day, I could play games for an hour.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to motivate yourself! Rewards can reinforce positive behaviors. What kind of rewards do you think would be most exciting for you?

User: Playing games with my friends or enjoying some extra time outside would be awesome!

Consultant: Those sound like enjoyable rewards! Building in fun activities with your friends can make your study goals feel less daunting. Why don’t we outline a simple daily schedule focusing on study time, football practice, and fun activities?

User: Yes, let’s do that! I’d like to see how that could fit together.

Consultant: Okay! Let's create a draft schedule together. We can dedicate time for studying, followed by football practice, and then include your gaming reward afterward. How many hours do you want to allocate to studying after school?

User: Maybe two hours after school. That allows me to relax a bit before diving into studying.

Consultant: That sounds reasonable! So, after school, you could take a short break to recharge, then study for two hours. How does that feel for you knowing you'll have that break before studying?

User: It makes me feel more relaxed thinking about having the break, rather than jumping straight in.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! After your two hours of studying, we can fit in your football training. What time do you typically have practice?

User: Practice is usually around 6 PM, so I need to finish studying before that.

Consultant: Perfect! So, you could finish studying by around 5 PM, giving you enough time to transition to football practice. How does that schedule sound so far?

User: It sounds good! I like that I’ll have a clear plan to follow.

Consultant: Great to hear you're feeling positive about it! Let's also make sure to include some time for gaming since you've mentioned it. How about allocating that reward time after your practice?

User: Yes! I can play games for an hour after practice as a reward. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! So the structure of your day would involve some relaxed time after school, followed by two focused hours of study, football practice, and then your gaming reward. Do you feel ready to try this schedule out?

User: I do! I’m excited to see how it works in practice.

Consultant: I believe you can do this, Zhao! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you make these changes. It may take time to adapt to the new routine. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out, and we can troubleshoot together. 

User: Thank you, I will keep that in mind. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your initiative and commitment. Look forward to hearing how things go at our next session. Remember, you've got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've been making progress in your social life and feeling more stable emotionally. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better. I have made some new friends, and it feels nice to be accepted. I've also been playing games a lot less lately!

Consultant: That sounds like wonderful progress, Zhao! Building friendships is important, and it's great that you're reducing your gaming time. Can you share a little more about how your interests outside of gaming have been developing?

User: I’ve started reading more again, and I really enjoy it. I even played soccer with my friends last weekend. It felt really fun!

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Engaging in activities you enjoy, like reading and soccer, can positively impact your mood and help strengthen your social connections. What kind of books are you reading?

User: I've been reading adventure stories. They’re really exciting! I like to imagine being part of those adventures.

Consultant: Adventure stories can be so thrilling! It’s great to see you immersing yourself in new worlds and experiences. How do you feel when you're reading these stories compared to when you were spending more time on games?

User: I feel more relaxed and happy when I read. Games sometimes make me feel frustrated if I lose.

Consultant: It's interesting how different activities can impact our emotions in various ways. Reading seems to provide that sense of calm and happiness for you. Have you thought about how you can incorporate more reading into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I can set a specific time each day to read instead of going on the computer?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Setting a specific time can help create a habit. How do you think this change will affect your overall routine?

User: I think it will help me manage my time better. I’ll be less tempted to play games all the time.

Consultant: Absolutely! It seems like this positive change can lead to a more balanced routine. Besides reading, are there any other activities you’d like to try or explore further?

User: I’d like to join a soccer club or something similar. It could be fun!

Consultant: Joining a soccer club could be an excellent way to meet more friends while enjoying a sport you love! It also keeps you active. What steps do you think you'd need to take to join a club?

User: I think I should ask my friends if they're already in one or how to find a club.

Consultant: That’s a sensible approach. It’s not only about joining but also ensuring you feel comfortable and supported. How do you think your friends would respond to this idea?

User: I think they would be excited and help me. They like playing soccer too!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Having supportive friends can make a big difference. It sounds like you have a good social circle. How can you use that support to stay motivated in your studies as well?

User: Maybe I can study with them. They could help me with English and math, since I'm struggling a bit there.

Consultant: Studying with friends is a great way to learn together! It could also make studying more enjoyable. How do you feel about reaching out to them for help?

User: I feel less nervous now. It sounds like a good idea to ask them.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Remember, your friends are there to support you, just like you support them. What do you think you can do if you start feeling overwhelmed with your studies?

User: I could take short breaks or ask my friends if I need help right away.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking breaks can help you recharge and asking for help shows strength. Let’s think about your gaming. You mentioned wanting to continue reducing your game time. How do you plan to manage that alongside your new activities?

User: I’ll set limits for myself, like only playing after finishing my homework or reading time.

Consultant: Setting limits is an effective strategy! It empowers you to have control over your time. What do you think will be the biggest challenge in sticking to these limits?

User: I think it might be tempting to play if I have a lot of free time but I’ll just have to remember how good I feel when I read or play soccer.

Consultant: That’s a smart awareness to have! Reminding yourself of how great those activities make you feel can help you stay motivated. Are there other techniques we could brainstorm that might help you reinforce these feelings as you work on this balance?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal about my feelings and progress. Writing things down might help me see how far I've come!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool to reflect on your journey and recognize your progress. What would you like to focus on in your journal first?

User: I could write about my experiences with my new friends and how I feel when I read or play sports. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Zhao! Documenting those positive experiences might help solidify those feelings and motivate you to continue progressing. As we approach the end of our session, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I learned that I can find balance and that I have friends to help me. I feel more confident about managing my time!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! You’re developing a great understanding of balance and support. Before we wrap up, let's think about how you’ll continue applying what we've discussed. Do you feel prepared to implement these strategies moving forward?

User: Yes! I feel excited about taking these steps. I’ll try to keep in touch with my friends and spend more time on reading and soccer!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Zhao! You’ve accomplished so much already, and I believe in your ability to continue this positive trajectory. Remember, I’m here for support if you need guidance in the future. Have a wonderful week ahead!

User: Thank you! I feel really good about all of this. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing well. I've been sharing my learning achievements with my friends, and that's made me really happy. I even feel more interested in studying English now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you've been experiencing a boost in your confidence and making progress in your studies. Can you tell me more about how sharing your accomplishments with your peers has impacted you?

User: Well, when I share my progress, my friends cheer me on, and it feels nice to be recognized. It makes me want to study harder. But sometimes, I still find it tough to focus because I get distracted by games.

Consultant: It sounds like your friends’ support is really valuable to you and helps motivate you to keep going. Let's talk about those distractions. When you feel the urge to play games, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think about how much fun playing games is, and I feel like I deserve a break after studying. But then it makes it hard for me to get back to studying afterward.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, wanting to reward yourself with something enjoyable. However, it seems like it might be creating a challenge in staying focused on your studies. Have you considered setting specific times for gaming so that it doesn’t interfere with your study schedule?

User: I haven’t really tried that yet, but it sounds like a good idea. I guess I could limit my gaming to the weekends or after completing my homework.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Setting boundaries can help you enjoy gaming without it affecting your responsibilities. How do you feel about creating a schedule that balances your study time and gaming time?

User: I think a schedule could really help. It would give me something to follow and remind me to keep my priorities straight.

Consultant: Exactly! Establishing a routine can help you feel more in control. What do you think would be a reasonable amount of time for studying and for gaming each day?

User: Maybe I could study for about two hours after school and then allow myself an hour to play games afterward. That sounds doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach. It allows you to focus on your studies while still enjoying gaming. How do you think making this change could influence your overall mood and motivation?

User: I think I would feel less guilty about playing games, and if I stick to that schedule, I’d probably feel more accomplished with my studies.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! It seems like you’re recognizing the connection between structure, accomplishment, and your happiness. How do you feel about tackling any possible challenges you might face sticking to this new schedule?

User: I guess I might struggle at first. I tend to get distracted easily, especially if my friends are online playing.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. What are some strategies you could use to stay focused when that temptation arises? 

User: I could turn off notifications on my phone or ask my friends to message me later. Maybe I could also find a quiet space to study where it’s less distracting.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! By minimizing distractions, you'll be better able to concentrate. How are you feeling about your progress in English since you mentioned developing an interest?

User: I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. I even started reading some simple English books, and I’m understanding more than before.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Engaging with the language in a fun way can really enhance your learning. What are your goals for your English studies moving forward? 

User: I want to improve my speaking skills. I think if I can talk more with my classmates in English, it will help me get better.

Consultant: That’s a superb goal! Speaking with classmates can build your confidence and reinforce what you learn. Have you thought about ways to practice speaking English with friends?

User: I haven’t really. Maybe I can start by having small conversations during lunch or asking a classmate to practice with me after school.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Small, consistent practice can make a large difference. How do you feel about setting a goal to have at least one English conversation with a classmate each week?

User: That sounds achievable! It would be nice to have a specific goal to work towards, and it can help me improve.

Consultant: Exactly! Setting achievable goals can keep your motivation high. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think your biggest takeaway is from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s important to find a balance between studying and playing games. Creating a schedule and setting goals for my English studies is really helpful.

Consultant: That’s an insightful takeaway, and I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, maintaining that balance is key to feeling satisfied in your studies and in your leisure activities. How will you ensure you follow through on what we discussed?

User: I’ll write down my schedule and share it with my parents, so they can help remind me. I’ll also check in weekly to see how I’m doing with my English goals.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Engaging your parents can provide added support, and reflecting on your progress can help you stay motivated. I believe you have the tools to continue this positive development. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and advice. I’m excited to see how things go!

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you today, and I’m excited for your journey ahead. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further support. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve felt much better. My exam scores have improved a lot, and my parents praised me, which made me really happy. I’ve also been spending much less time on video games.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It's wonderful that you've received recognition for your hard work. Can you tell me how you managed to reduce your gaming time?

User: It was a bit challenging at first, but I set a schedule to allow myself only a short time to play after finishing my homework. I think having a plan helped a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve developed a healthier routine for yourself! How do you feel about your studies now compared to earlier this year?

User: I'm feeling more confident. I'm still having some trouble with English and math, but I’m trying to practice a bit every day. I actually enjoy it more now.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making progress and enjoying your studies more! You mentioned difficulty in English and math—what specific challenges do you face in these subjects?

User: In English, I struggle with vocabulary and understanding some sentences. For math, sometimes the problems just confuse me. I find it hard to keep up with some of the advanced stuff.

Consultant: Those challenges are quite common, especially when adjusting to a new school. Have you thought about any specific strategies to help you improve in those areas?

User: I’ve been using flashcards for English words, and I try to practice some math problems each day. It seems to help, but I still get frustrated sometimes.

Consultant: It's normal to feel frustrated, but it sounds like you're taking proactive steps. What do you do when you encounter something difficult in your studies?

User: I usually take a break and do something I enjoy, like playing football or reading. It helps me clear my mind before I try again.

Consultant: Taking breaks for your hobbies sounds like a great way to recharge! How do you feel when you get back to studying after a break?

User: I feel more relaxed and focused, which helps me tackle the problems better. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Your approach of balancing study with activities you enjoy is very effective. Have you set any new goals for yourself regarding your studies or interests?

User: I’m thinking of aiming for a higher score in my next math test and maybe joining a reading club at school. 

Consultant: Both sound like excellent goals! Setting these targets can also serve as motivation. How do you feel about your ability to achieve them?

User: I feel positive! I believe if I keep practicing and stay organized, I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Motivation is key to achieving your goals. Let’s take a moment to think about how you can keep that positivity going. Any ideas on how you can stay motivated?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with some fun activities after completing my tasks and achieving my goals. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Rewards can boost your motivation and make the process more enjoyable. Would you like to come up with a specific plan for those rewards?

User: Sure! I think after finishing my homework during the week, I could watch an episode of my favorite show or play a game on the weekend, but only if I meet my study goals.

Consultant: That sounds like a fair plan! Keeping yourself accountable in that way can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, let’s review what you’ve accomplished. What do you think has been your biggest achievement since we started these sessions?

User: I think it’s my ability to manage my time better and improve my grades. It feels amazing to see my hard work pay off.

Consultant: You should definitely be proud of that! You've made significant strides, and it's clear you're working hard. As we finish today, how can you ensure that you maintain this progress in the future?

User: I’ll keep setting smaller goals and remember to balance my studies with things I love. This helps me stay positive.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach, Zhao. I’m confident that you can keep moving forward like this. Remember, if you ever find challenges arise, feel free to reach out. Today has been a successful session, and I look forward to hearing about your future achievements!

User: Thank you so much! I'm really grateful for your help and support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Let’s stay in touch, and I wish you the best on your journey ahead.
