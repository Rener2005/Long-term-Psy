Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I’m really glad you’re here today. You mentioned feeling anxious about the upcoming mid-term exams. Could you share more about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’m feeling really anxious. I keep worrying that I won’t perform well on my exams, even though I’ve studied hard. At night, I can’t fall asleep because my mind races with all these worries.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of pressure and that it's affecting your sleep as well. Let’s explore what specifically about the exams is worrying you. What thoughts come to mind when you think about your performance?

User: I just keep thinking that if I don’t get good grades, I’ll disappoint my mom and my teachers. I feel like all my hard work might not pay off, and that really scares me.

Consultant: That’s understandable, feeling like your efforts might not be recognized can be really overwhelming. Let's break it down a bit. When those thoughts pop up, how do they make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: I feel this tightness in my chest, and my heart races. It’s like I can’t catch my breath sometimes, and I just feel this overwhelming worry.

Consultant: That tightness can really be uncomfortable. It sounds like these thoughts have a strong impact on your body and emotions. What do you usually do when you start feeling that way?

User: I usually try to distract myself by watching videos or scrolling through my phone, but it doesn’t really help. I just end up feeling more anxious about the time I’m wasting.

Consultant: It’s common to try to escape those feelings. It’s important to find ways to manage anxiety that actually help you feel better in the long run. Have you ever tried any relaxation techniques before? 

User: Not really. I don’t know many ways to relax, and I’ve tried some sleep aids, but they didn’t work well for me.

Consultant: I see! Let’s explore some relaxation techniques that could help you feel calmer during this stressful time. One technique we can try is called progressive muscle relaxation. Have you heard of it before?

User: No, I haven’t. What is that?

Consultant: Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. It helps to release the built-up tension and can promote a sense of calm. Would you like to learn how to do it?

User: That sounds interesting. How do I start?

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. We’ll begin by taking a deep breath in through your nose, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. 

User: Okay, I’m ready.

Consultant: Now, I want you to focus on your feet. Tense the muscles in your feet tightly for about five seconds. Really feel that tension. 

User: Alright, I’m tensing them now.

Consultant: Good! Now release the tension and feel your feet relax completely. Notice the difference between the tension and the relaxation.

User: Wow, I feel a bit lighter. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Now let’s move up to your calves. Tense those muscles for five seconds… and release. Let that tension go. 

User: Okay, I did it. I actually feel a bit less anxious.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaofang. This practice can really help you manage anxiety, especially before your exams. How do you feel about trying this technique regularly before your study sessions or even bedtime?

User: I think it could help. I’m willing to give it a try!

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Consistency can really make a difference. Now, let’s discuss what specific thoughts about the exams you'd like to challenge. Can you think of any thoughts that come to mind when you think about them?

User: I often think, “What if I fail?” or “I’m not smart enough to succeed.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let’s examine them. How much evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Can you recall times when you succeeded, despite feeling that way?

User: I did really well in my last exams, but I keep doubting that I can do it again.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. Your past achievements are evidence that you can succeed. What other thoughts could you replace those negative ones with?

User: Maybe I could think, “I’ve prepared well, and I can handle this.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much more balanced thought. When you find yourself feeling anxious, remind yourself of that positive affirmation. How does that make you feel when you say it?

User: It feels better... like I have some control.

Consultant: That’s a powerful feeling to have! Control over your thoughts can really help ease anxiety. Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?

User: I think I just need to remember these techniques and keep practicing them.

Consultant: Absolutely. Practicing will help reinforce your ability to use them when you need them. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. We explored your anxiety triggers, practiced relaxation techniques, and identified more positive thoughts to replace the negative ones. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have some useful tools now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, it’s normal to still feel some anxiety, especially before exams. It’s all about finding strategies to manage it. If you have any questions or need further support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaofang! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I believe you have the potential to manage this anxiety effectively. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fang! I'm glad to see you again. Last time, we discussed some relaxation techniques you’ve started using. How have things been going since then, especially with the upcoming mid-term exams?

User: Hi! I've been trying to use those techniques, but I still feel really nervous about the exams. It's like no matter how hard I try, I can't shake off the anxiety.

Consultant: I hear you. It must be tough to feel that anxiety lingering despite your efforts. Can you tell me more about the thoughts or feelings that come up when you think about the exams?

User: When I think about the exams, I feel this tightness in my chest and my mind races. I worry that if I don’t perform well, I’ll let everyone down, especially my mom.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pressure on your shoulders. This worry about disappointing your mom seems to weigh heavily on you. What specific thoughts do you have about the exams themselves?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t get the grades I want, it means I’m not good enough, and everyone will think I’m a failure.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like you’re feeling that your self-worth is tied directly to your exam results. Let’s explore this further—how much evidence do you think supports that thought? 

User: I guess there’s no real proof. My mom tells me I’m doing well, but it’s hard to believe that when I see other students performing better.

Consultant: It’s understandable to compare yourself to others, but remember, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to reassure them?

User: I’d tell them that their worth isn’t based on grades and that they should focus on doing their best instead of comparing themselves to others.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive approach! It’s great that you can provide that perspective for a friend. Now, how might you apply that same thinking to yourself during this exam period?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect and that I just need to do my best without worrying too much about others.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a healthy mindset to adopt. Additionally, since you’ve been practicing relaxation techniques, how have they been helping you when you start to feel anxious?

User: They do help a little, especially deep breathing, but it’s hard to remember to use them when I’m really stressed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to find it challenging to apply techniques in the moment. Perhaps we can work on integrating these relaxation methods into your daily routine. What do you think about setting aside specific times to practice them?

User: That sounds helpful! If I stick to a schedule, I might remember to use them better when I need them.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Let’s aim for small, manageable sessions, like five minutes of deep breathing each morning or before studying. How do you feel about that?

User: I think I can manage that! It sounds easy to incorporate into my routine.

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating these practices regularly will make it easier for you to access them when you need to calm your nerves. Now, let’s talk about the exam itself. What aspects do you think could help improve your confidence during the test?

User: Maybe if I had a positive mantra to repeat or remembered to take breaks, I wouldn’t feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A positive mantra can serve as a comforting reminder. What could that mantra be for you?

User: I could say something like, "I am capable, and I will do my best."

Consultant: I love that mantra! It sounds empowering. You could also practice saying it right before you start studying or during breaks to reinforce that positive message. 

User: Yes, I think that will definitely help me. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about recognizing your efforts and being kind to yourself, regardless of the outcome. As you prepare for the exams, what steps can you take to maintain a balance between study and relaxation?

User: I could plan out my study schedule to include breaks and time for relaxation. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! A balanced schedule can help you feel more in control. Would you be comfortable sharing how you might structure this study and relaxation time?

User: I think I could study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break to practice breathing or stretch.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan and aligns well with techniques to boost focus and reduce tension! It’s essential to listen to your body. If you find yourself feeling particularly stressed, even a short break can make a significant difference. 

User: Yeah, I think I need to remember that it’s okay to pause whenever I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking those pauses is not only okay but necessary for maintaining your mental well-being. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned or planned that could really help going forward?

User: I’ve learned that I can change my thoughts about exams and that setting a specific routine may help me manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That’s a big realization, Xiao Fang! Your awareness will definitely serve you well. As you look ahead to your exams, focus on the strategies you’ve outlined today. Remember, practice makes perfect. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my anxiety now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I have confidence in your ability to implement these strategies. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need support, remember you’re not alone, and I’m here to help. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: It was great chatting with you today, Xiao Fang. Take care of yourself as you prepare, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. 

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I’m glad to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since our last talk about your exam preparation?

User: Hi! I think I've been managing a bit better, but I still feel anxious about some subjects. I want to handle that anxiety better during exams.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better. Can you tell me which subjects are still causing you the most anxiety?

User: I feel particularly anxious about math and physics. I worry that I might not perform well, even if I study hard.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with subjects that can be quite challenging. When you think about your performance in these subjects, what kind of thoughts come to your mind during your study sessions or exams?

User: I often think that I’ll mess up the exam and let everyone down, especially my mom. That thought really puts pressure on me.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really heavy on you. Let’s explore this a bit more. When you have that thought about messing up, how does it make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really nervous and I lose my focus. Sometimes I want to give up on studying altogether.

Consultant: I see how those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety and affect your motivation to study. Can we identify if there are any specific situations where these thoughts come up most often?

User: Usually, it’s right before I start studying or during a practice exam. Just thinking about it makes me anxious again.

Consultant: That makes sense. In those moments, we can try to challenge those thoughts. For example, what evidence do you have that you will indeed mess up the exam?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence; it's just a strong feeling I have. Last time, I did better than I expected, but I still can’t shake off the worry.

Consultant: It's good that you've had some positive outcomes before. What would you say to a friend who had similar concerns about an exam? How would you encourage them?

User: I would tell them to focus on their preparation and remind them that it's okay to make mistakes. They just need to do their best.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate approach! Why not try to adopt that same kind of supportive self-talk when you feel anxious? How might you reframe your thoughts in a way that emphasizes your effort and preparation?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I've prepared well and that I can handle whatever happens during the exam. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a much healthier perspective. Let’s also think about some practical strategies to help you manage your anxiety on exam day. What are some activities you enjoy that could help you relax before the exam?

User: I like listening to music and going for short walks. Those help me feel better.

Consultant: Excellent! Incorporating those activities into your study routine or the days leading up to the exam might provide you with a sense of calm. Let’s plan to use music and walks as part of your strategy to manage pre-exam anxiety. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! It might help distract me from the pressure.

Consultant: Great! Now, it’s also important to practice some positive affirmations right before the exam. What could be a simple and motivating phrase you could repeat to yourself?

User: Maybe something like “I am prepared, and I will do my best.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Repeating it can help reinforce your confidence. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today. Can you share the key strategies you plan to use to help alleviate your anxiety during exams?

User: Sure! I’ll remind myself that I’m prepared, use positive affirmations, listen to music, and take short walks to relax.

Consultant: Those sound like strong strategies that can really help you. How do you feel about implementing these in the lead-up to your exams?

User: I feel hopeful. I think having a plan will definitely ease my mind.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiaofang! Remember, it's all about progress and finding what works best for you. Before we end today's session, what do you think you might take from our conversation that can help you moving forward?

User: I believe focusing on my preparation and my ability to manage stress will make a big difference. Plus, the self-talk strategies are something I want to practice more.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re taking important steps toward building your confidence and managing your anxiety. Keep practicing those strategies, and I’m here to support you. I'm really proud of the progress you’ve made today.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support, and I’ll make sure to work on these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s all about small steps forward. If you feel you need help in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your upcoming exams, Xiaofang!

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Xiaofang!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fang! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit better. My exam results improved in some subjects after applying the strategies we discussed. But I still feel a bit anxious about upcoming tests.

Consultant: That’s great to hear about your improved results! It sounds like you're starting to feel some sense of accomplishment. Can you share more about how you’ve been managing your anxiety and what strategies you found helpful?

User: Yes! I tried to focus on my study plan more and used some breathing techniques when I felt overwhelmed. It helped a little, but sometimes the anxiety still creeps back in.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re implementing the techniques we talked about! Breathing exercises can be really effective. When you say the anxiety creeps back in, can you tell me more about what triggers that anxiety for you?

User: It's usually when I think about the amount of material I have to study. I feel like I can’t keep up, and then I struggle to concentrate.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when there’s a lot on your plate. Let’s explore that thought. When you think about the amount of study material, what kinds of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think that I’ll fail if I can’t cover everything, and that makes me really anxious. It’s like I can’t afford to miss anything.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense; they could indeed heighten your anxiety. What evidence do you have to support that thought? Is it possible that there are other ways to look at your situation?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s mostly fear of failure that drives those thoughts. I’ve done well in the past, so maybe I’m overthinking it.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a lot of pressure you’re putting on yourself due to fear of failure. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think about this situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that they’ve done well before, and it's okay if they can’t cover everything perfectly. They should just do their best and not be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective to have toward a friend. It’s interesting to notice how we can be kinder to others than to ourselves. How can you apply that same compassion to your own situation?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to not know everything and that I can learn from the process, rather than aiming for perfection.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing the learning process can reduce that pressure you feel. How would it feel for you to focus on doing your best rather than achieving perfection?

User: I think it would feel a lot less stressful. I could be more relaxed and maybe enjoy studying more.

Consultant: That's an important shift to aim for. Let’s also think about some practical strategies to support this change. Would you like to explore some ways to manage your time effectively and incorporate mindfulness practices into your study routine?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I sometimes feel disorganized, and that adds to my stress.

Consultant: Great! Time management skills can really help create a sense of control. How about starting with a weekly study schedule? You can break down your material into manageable chunks each day.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could plan out what to study each day instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: Exactly! This way, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment each day. Alongside this, we could introduce a short mindfulness practice, like focusing on your breath for a few minutes to clear your mind before studying. What do you think?

User: I’m willing to try that. It might help me calm down before I start studying.

Consultant: Wonderful! Starting with just a few minutes can make a significant difference. How do you feel about our plan so far?

User: I feel more hopeful. Having a structured plan makes me feel like I can tackle my studies without being overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you are really taking steps toward improving your experience with studying. As we continue to build on these strategies, how can you remind yourself to stay compassionate during this process?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to note my feelings and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. I can celebrate the small wins too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can help you reflect on your progress and maintain that self-compassion. What small win can you acknowledge from this week?

User: I managed to stick to my study schedule for three days straight, which is better than usual for me.

Consultant: That's a great accomplishment! Recognizing your efforts will help boost your confidence. As we approach the end of our session, what strategies do you think you’ll carry into next week?

User: I’ll continue my study schedule and practice mindfulness before studying. I’ll also try to be kinder to myself about progress.

Consultant: Those are solid strategies, Xiao Fang! You’re making strides toward maintaining your mental health and improving your study effectiveness. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. When we meet next, we can discuss how this goes and any adjustments you’d like to make.

User: Thank you for your support! I’m looking forward to our next session and seeing how it goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your ability to manage this. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to implement those adjustment techniques we discussed. I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of it, but I still have moments of anxiety, especially when I think about upcoming exams.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're working on those techniques! It's normal to feel anxious about exams. Can you share what specific moments trigger your anxiety lately?

User: Well, whenever I start studying for a test, a wave of worry washes over me about not being able to remember everything or not doing well. It makes it hard to concentrate.

Consultant: It sounds like those worries create a significant barrier for you when you study. Can you tell me what thoughts usually come to mind during those moments of anxiety? What do you find yourself thinking?

User: I often think, "What if I fail again?" or "I'm not as good as others." These thoughts just spiral, and then I feel even more overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. They seem to create a cycle of anxiety that makes it even harder to focus. Let’s take a closer look at those beliefs. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much evidence do you think there is that supports those thoughts?

User: Maybe a 2, because I did well in past exams besides that one failure. But it feels so heavy in the moment.

Consultant: I understand. That heaviness can cloud your judgment. What would you tell a friend who expressed similar concerns about their exams? How might you encourage them to think differently?

User: I would probably tell them that one bad exam doesn't define their abilities and that they should focus on what they can control now.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful perspective. It seems like you already recognize that a single incident doesn't determine your worth or future success. How can you apply that same compassion to yourself when those anxious thoughts arise?

User: I guess I could remind myself of all the hard work I’ve put in and that it's just one exam. I need to focus on what I can do right now.

Consultant: Absolutely, that sounds like a wonderful approach. Practicing self-compassion can really help ease that anxiety. Are there any specific actions you can take during your study sessions to reinforce this mindset?

User: Maybe I can take short breaks to breathe and remind myself of my past successes? Or create a positive affirmation to repeat when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Taking breaks for deep breathing can help clear your mind and reduce stress. Creating affirmations is also a great way to reframe your thoughts. What affirmation do you think would resonate with you?

User: How about, "I am capable, and I will do my best"? It feels empowering.

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation, Xiaofang! Making that a part of your routine can create a positive shift in your mindset. How do you think you can incorporate that into your study sessions?

User: I could write it somewhere visible, maybe on my desk or my study planner. And I can say it to myself before I start studying.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having it in sight and vocalizing it can really reinforce that positive belief. As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on the progress you've made. How have you felt about your emotional journey and your strategies since we started?

User: I've noticed that I'm becoming more aware of my thoughts and feelings. It feels good to actively try to change my mindset. I feel a little more confident in handling my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Recognizing your progress is such an important step. And what do you think you might do in the future to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I think I’ll keep using those techniques we talked about and maybe set small goals for myself when studying. That might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a great strategy! It can make tasks feel more manageable and less intimidating. Before we conclude our session, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Just feeling grateful for the support!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaofang! You’ve made significant strides, and I'm confident you’ll continue to develop these skills. Remember, you can always come back if you need support. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaofang! I'm glad to see you again for this session. It sounds like you've been making some positive changes recently. How are you feeling today about your transition into senior year?

User: Hi! I feel okay. I'm actually excited about starting senior year, but I still have some worries about keeping up my grades and managing my time better.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling excited! It’s also normal to have some worries. Let’s explore those concerns a bit more. What specific aspects of managing your time and grades are you worried about?

User: I guess I'm afraid that I won't be able to balance everything—school work, preparing for college, and still having time for myself. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Balancing these responsibilities can indeed be challenging. It's important to find time for yourself as well. Have you thought about any strategies that might help you manage your time and responsibilities better?

User: I haven't really figured that out yet. I try to make schedules, but I find myself ignoring them when I'm stressed.

Consultant: That’s a common issue. Sometimes, when we get stressed, sticking to a schedule feels even harder. Could we try to identify what specifically makes you ignore your schedule during stressful times? 

User: I think it’s just that I can’t concentrate and then I procrastinate. I end up doing things last minute, which only adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there’s a cycle of anxiety and procrastination happening. What thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself procrastinating?

User: I start thinking that I will never finish everything, or that I’m not good enough, which makes me want to avoid it all even more.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. Let's take a moment to challenge those beliefs. Can we explore the evidence for those thoughts? Is it true that you will never finish everything or that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I did finish things eventually, even if it was last minute. But I just feel like I should have done better.

Consultant: It's excellent that you were able to finish, even if it was under pressure. Let's reframe that thought. Instead of focusing solely on how you should have performed, what if we recognized that completing your tasks, despite the stress, is still an achievement?

User: That makes sense. Maybe I can look at it differently. I mean, I did manage to get through it, even if it wasn’t the ideal way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating that achievement is important. Now, going forward, how can we set up a supportive environment where you can recognize those achievements and gradually reduce the pressure you feel?

User: Maybe I could try to set smaller goals, so it feels less overwhelming? Like breaking down my study material into parts and focusing on one at a time.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! By breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts, you can build a sense of accomplishment along the way. How do you feel about implementing that approach?

User: I feel more hopeful thinking about it that way! I guess it’s less about perfection and more about progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Progress can lead to better emotional management and ultimately improve your performance. How about we also consider some support systems? Have you reached out to family or friends about how they can help you during this busy time?

User: I talked a bit with my mom, and she seems more open to helping me. I think I could ask her to check in on me or help me with my study plans.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! Engaging with your family for support can make a big difference. How do you feel about the idea of reaching out to your mom for this support?

User: I feel relieved! It’s nice to know she can help me. I haven’t done that enough.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re feeling relief. Remember, communication with your family can strengthen your emotional support system. As you reflect on our discussion today, what key takeaways can you identify regarding your approach to balancing your responsibilities?

User: I think I learned that I can break tasks down, celebrate my progress, and lean on my family for support. 

Consultant: Those are excellent insights, Xiaofang! As we conclude today, how do you plan to maintain this momentum and implement your strategies moving forward?

User: I’ll start by making a new study schedule that includes smaller goals and checking in with my mom weekly to keep track of how I’m doing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe you have the tools you need to navigate this transition successfully, and I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s okay to reach out again if you ever feel overwhelmed. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you all the best as you enter senior year. Take care, and I hope to hear about your successes in the future!
