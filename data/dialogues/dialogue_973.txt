Consultant: Hi Xiaoyan, I'm glad you're back for our session. I want to check in with you today about how you've been feeling. What’s been on your mind recently?

User: Hello. I've been feeling really down lately, especially after those recent mock exams. I didn’t do well, and it’s just adding to my stress. I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I’m not getting anywhere.

Consultant: I understand that failing to perform well in those exams is quite disheartening. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. Can you tell me more about how these experiences are impacting your daily life?

User: Well, I find it hard to enjoy anything these days. I feel so low that I struggle to fall asleep at night, and sometimes I don't even feel hungry. It’s just this constant cloud of sadness.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoyan. It's understandable to feel heavy emotions when you're under so much pressure. Let’s explore this sadness a bit more. When you think about your thoughts around studying and your recent exams, what comes to your mind?

User: I keep thinking that no matter what I do, I will always be at the bottom. I feel like my efforts don’t count for anything. It hurts to see my friends doing well while I’m stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really defeated by comparing your situation with your friends. Can we examine these thoughts together? What evidence do you have that suggests you will always be at the bottom?

User: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence—it's just a feeling I’ve built up over time, especially with my recent grades. It often feels true because it’s been my experience.

Consultant: It's really insightful to recognize that these feelings are based more on your experiences rather than facts. Let’s try to reframe it a bit. If you had a friend who shared feelings similar to yours, what would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them that grades don’t define their worth and that everyone has their ups and downs. I should remind myself of that too.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's essential to remember that everyone faces challenges, and grades are just one part of the journey. Can you think of any other aspects of yourself or your work that deserve recognition?

User: I guess I try hard in my other subjects, and I’m passionate about a few things, like my art. But it’s hard to focus on that when I’m feeling this way.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Embracing your passion for art may help uplift you. How about we set a small goal for you to incorporate some art into your week? Maybe even as a way to break your study routine?

User: That sounds nice. I used to love drawing, but I haven’t done it in a while. Setting a goal to draw could be helpful.

Consultant: Yes! Focusing on something you enjoy can create a positive emotional shift. Let’s aim for just 15-20 minutes of drawing a few times this week. How does that sound?

User: I can try that. It feels good to think about drawing again. Maybe it will help me unwind.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling positive about it! Let’s also talk about how to deal with the anxiety around exams. What do you think contributes to that anxiety for you?

User: I think it's the pressure to perform well. My parents expect a lot from me, and I really want to make them proud. But it feels like too much sometimes.

Consultant: That's understandable; parental expectations can add significant pressure. While it’s great to want to make them proud, it's also important to focus on what you want and need. How might changing your internal dialogue about these expectations help you?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to do my best, rather than aiming for perfection all the time. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Setting realistic goals can help ease that pressure. What would a less perfectionistic approach look like for your study routine?

User: Maybe I could set achievable milestones for each study session instead of expecting to master everything at once. That might reduce the stress.

Consultant: Yes, breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces can make a huge difference. It allows space for progress and achievement, even with small steps. How do you feel about trying that strategy moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. It feels less daunting thinking about it that way.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Xiaoyan! Hope is a powerful ally. As we work together, keep in mind the importance of celebrating even the small wins. How do you think you can remind yourself of that in the coming week?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to note down what I've accomplished each day, even if they seem small?

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Journaling can help you reflect on your progress and keep a positive outlook. Let's also discuss how to manage negative thoughts as they pop up. When you notice those feelings of inadequacy, what strategies do you think might help?

User: I could tell myself that it’s just a momentary feeling rather than my reality. Maybe I can practice some breathing exercises when those thoughts come to mind.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Recognizing that thoughts are not always facts is a vital step. It’s also helpful to have tools, like breathing exercises, to ground you during overwhelming moments. 

User: I feel like I have a bit more control over how I deal with these emotions now. It gives me some hope.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift, Xiaoyan! Building that control is empowering, and I believe you can continue to grow. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s important to be kinder to myself and to recognize that it’s okay to have ups and downs. I can acknowledge my struggles but also find joy in things I love.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your struggles while allowing space for joy is crucial. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. We can continue to work on these strategies together in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. I’m looking forward to trying these new techniques.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyan! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before then.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyan! I'm glad you're here today. I know we had a lot to discuss last time. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, to be honest. After the argument with my mom, I just feel even more isolated. Sometimes I think I’m just not good enough, especially with my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling really lonely and that the argument has intensified your existing feelings of inadequacy. Let's take a moment to explore what you've been thinking. What specifically comes to mind when you feel you're not good enough?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is doing better than me, especially my brother. My parents always talk about his achievements, and it just makes me feel like I’m not living up to their expectations.

Consultant: That’s a tough situation, feeling overshadowed by your brother's accomplishments. It sounds like you might be comparing your worth to his successes. How does that affect your feelings about your own achievements?

User: It makes me feel like I’m failing at everything. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t seem to get good grades. I sometimes feel like I work so hard but get nothing in return.

Consultant: I hear you. Putting in a lot of effort and not seeing the results can be very disheartening. Let's think about those efforts—what are some examples of things you’ve worked hard on recently?

User: I try to study every day, but I often end up feeling more confused. I think my grades reflect how little I’ve achieved.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when things don't go as you hoped. However, remember that grades aren't the only measure of effort or intelligence. What if we looked at some of the progress you've made, even if it's small?

User: I guess I did manage to finish my homework on time this week. But I still feel it's not enough. 

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Completing homework is a step forward. Sometimes, we forget to recognize our progress because we focus too much on the end results. What would it look like for you to celebrate those small victories along the way?

User: I never really thought about celebrating them. I always feel like I should be doing more. 

Consultant: It’s quite common to feel that way, especially in tough circumstances. Would you be willing to challenge that thought? What if you told yourself it’s okay to recognize your small wins, too?

User: That sounds easier said than done. I’m not sure I can change how I see things.

Consultant: It can be challenging, I completely understand. What if I asked you this: if a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view their efforts?

User: I’d probably tell them to be proud of themselves and not be so harsh.

Consultant: Exactly! Your advice to a friend is very kind and compassionate. You deserve to extend that same kindness to yourself. Can you see how that perspective might shift your feelings about your achievements?

User: Maybe. It feels strange, but I guess it could help to think that way.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it takes time. Remember, it’s okay to start small. Let’s try this: for the next week, can you keep a journal of your daily accomplishments, no matter how minor?

User: I could try that. Writing it down might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: Great! Just remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. As you notice your accomplishments, how do you think it will change how you feel about your worth?

User: I hope it helps me feel a bit more positive and not so overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal. Over time, practicing self-acknowledgment can build your confidence. Before we wrap up today, how else can you incorporate self-encouragement into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself and treat myself when I achieve them, like taking a break or watching my favorite show.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Treating yourself is an important part of self-care. And remember, every goal you achieve, no matter the size, is a step toward building a more positive view of yourself. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help today. I feel a bit lighter. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoyan. You're doing important work on yourself, and I believe you can keep moving forward. We'll continue this journey together next time. 

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it! Thank you again. 

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you at our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! It's great to see you today. I'm really glad you've come in. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better. I've started to appreciate some of the relationships around me, especially with my classmates. It feels good, but I'm still struggling with my studies.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling some warmth in your connections with your classmates. That’s a positive step! Now, could you share more about what you're struggling with in your studies? 

User: I don't feel like I'm making progress. My grades are still low, and I sometimes feel like all my effort is wasted, especially given how hard I try. 

Consultant: I hear you. It's tough when it feels like your hard work isn’t paying off. Let's explore those feelings a bit more—when you think about your studies and the effort you put in, what thoughts come to mind? 

User: I just think that I'm not good enough. Sometimes I compare myself to my classmates, and it makes me feel worse because I believe they are much smarter than me.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Xiaoyan. It’s common to engage in comparisons, but these thoughts can be really challenging. When you say you're not good enough, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel anxious and frustrated. I often have this sense of hopelessness about improving my grades.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult to cope with. Can we take a moment to challenge that thought? What kind of evidence do you have that supports the belief that you aren’t good enough? And could there be other explanations for your struggles? 

User: Well, I haven't done well in tests, and my parents always seem disappointed. Maybe that's why I feel this way.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel pressure from those around you. But let’s consider—could studying differently or seeking help possibly change that situation? What advice would you give to a friend if they were feeling the same way?

User: I’d probably tell them to keep trying and maybe ask for help. But I don’t really take my own advice.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Sometimes we hesitate to practice what we preach. Why do you think that might be for you? 

User: I guess I just don’t believe it will work for me. I think I’m destined to fail in this.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaoyan. It sounds like there’s a lot of self-doubt. Let’s try a small experiment—what if you wrote down a few things you’ve accomplished recently, no matter how small? It might help to remind you of your capabilities.

User: Alright, I can try that. I did manage to complete a group project recently, and I felt a little proud of myself for that.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Completing a project is a significant achievement, especially since you felt a sense of accomplishment. Let’s build on that. Is there a way you can use that feeling of pride to help motivate you in your studies?

User: Maybe I could think about how I felt after finishing that project and try to apply that to my studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a wonderful approach! By recognizing those positive feelings, you'll be able to motivate yourself. What strategies could you use to remind yourself of that feeling during study sessions?

User: I could maybe write a note for myself or create a small reward system whenever I study for a certain amount of time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Writing a note as a reminder and having a reward system can create positive reinforcement for your efforts. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I think it could work! I like having a visual reminder. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s talk a bit about self-talk. How do you talk to yourself when things get tough, especially around studying? 

User: I tend to be really harsh on myself. I say things like, “You’re so stupid” or “You’ll never get this.” 

Consultant: That can be really tough. Would you be willing to try some positive self-talk instead? For instance, replacing those harsh phrases with something kinder, like “I’m doing the best I can” or “I can learn this if I keep trying”?

User: I could give that a shot! It sounds more supportive.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to adopt! Remember, being kind to yourself is a critical part of this process. Moving forward, how do you plan to integrate this positive self-talk into your daily routine? 

User: I might write those affirmations down and put them on my wall or something so that I see them every day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiaoyan! Visual reminders can be incredibly helpful. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what we've discussed. What do you think will be the most helpful takeaway for you moving forward?

User: I think focusing on my achievements and using positive self-talk will help me a lot. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Acknowledging your progress and practicing kindness in your self-talk are powerful tools. Remember, you’re making strides in improving your perception of yourself. If you encounter challenges, know that you can always return to these strategies. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more confident about my next steps. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've shown great resilience today, Xiaoyan. Keep up the self-affirmation and positive thinking. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I'll work on those strategies and see you next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I noticed you've been exploring some emotional regulation techniques recently. How can I assist you today?

User: Hi! Yes, I've learned a bit about emotional regulation techniques in my psychology class, and I'm feeling curious about how to actually use them to help me with my stress levels, especially with school.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It sounds like you want to apply these techniques to manage your stress. Can you tell me more about what specific stressors you're currently dealing with, especially in your studies?

User: Well, I'm really struggling with my schoolwork. It feels overwhelming, and I often feel like I put in a lot of effort but don’t see the results. I'm also worried about disappointing my parents since they expect a lot from me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when there are high expectations involved. Let’s think about how you can use the emotional regulation techniques you've learned. Have you tried any specific strategies so far?

User: I’ve tried some breathing exercises, which help a little, but I struggle to stick with them when I feel anxious or rushed.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be challenging to remember to use relaxation techniques when you're feeling stressed. Would you like us to explore ways to integrate these breathing exercises into your daily routine more seamlessly?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to be more consistent with it.

Consultant: Great! We can develop a plan where you can practice these techniques at specific times, perhaps before studying or during breaks. When do you usually feel most anxious about your studies?

User: I feel anxious mostly in the evenings when I sit down to do homework. My mind just races with worry, and I often end up procrastinating.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like we can target those evening study sessions with some of the techniques you’ve learned. How about setting a short time frame for study and then taking a few minutes for breathing exercises before you begin?

User: That sounds doable! Maybe I can try studying for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break for some deep breathing.

Consultant: Exactly! This method can help you create a rhythm and signal your body to relax in between study sessions. How do you feel about trying that approach?

User: I feel optimistic about it! I think having a structure will really help me manage my anxiety.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Now, let’s also think about the emotions that arise when you sit down to study. What thoughts come to mind that might contribute to your anxiety?

User: I often think things like “I’ll never understand this,” or “I’m going to fail,” which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed feel heavy. Let’s challenge those a bit. Can we identify any evidence that supports or contradicts those thoughts? For instance, have there been times when you understood the material better than you expected?

User: Yes, there were a few times I surprised myself, but I tend to forget those moments in the face of stress.

Consultant: It’s easy to dismiss positive experiences when we’re feeling anxious. Perhaps we can keep a journal where you write down those moments of success, however small, to remind yourself of your abilities. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds like a helpful idea! It would be nice to reflect on the good moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small victories can boost your confidence. Now, let’s talk about your feelings regarding your parents’ expectations. How do those feelings impact your motivation and engagement with your studies?

User: I feel a lot of pressure because I know they have high hopes for me, but it also makes me want to give up sometimes.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It might be worthwhile to separate your self-worth from their expectations. You have your own path and strengths. How might you remind yourself of your own objectives and ambitions, rather than solely focusing on theirs?

User: I suppose I can make a list of my personal goals and why I want to achieve them, not just for my parents, but for myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Involving yourself in your own aspirations can create a stronger sense of purpose. Would you be willing to work on that list before our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like to do that. It might help clear my mind.

Consultant: Excellent! So, to recap, you’ll try the structured study and breathing technique, maintain a success journal, and create a personal goals list. How do you feel about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel more empowered. I appreciate having a plan to follow and some strategies to work with.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve taken some positive steps today, and I believe these practices will help you feel more in control and resilient. Remember, it's okay to reach out when you need support or guidance. Until we meet again, I’m confident you’ll do well.

User: Thank you! I feel hopeful about trying these things. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoyan! I'm here whenever you need help. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yan! I’m glad you’re here today. It sounds like you’ve been making some progress lately. How are you feeling about your recent experiences?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident ever since I expressed myself in class and got positive feedback from my teacher. But I still struggle with my studies and sometimes feel like my efforts are not enough. 

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've been feeling more confident! It's natural to have mixed feelings, especially when it comes to studying. Could you share more about what you feel when you think about your efforts in your studies?

User: I often feel frustrated because I try hard but my grades don’t reflect my effort. It makes me question whether I'm capable of improving, and sometimes I just want to give up. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and self-doubt, which is understandable. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel like giving up on your studies?

User: I think things like, “I’ll never get better” or “Why even try?” These thoughts make me feel really hopeless.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming, and they often create a cycle of discouragement. Can we try to challenge one of those thoughts together? For instance, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that you’ll never get better?

User: I guess there’s not a lot of evidence for it. I have had some moments of improvement, like in that recent class when I expressed myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's important to recognize those moments of improvement. What if we were to replace the thought “I’ll never get better” with something more balanced? What might that look like for you?

User: Maybe something like “I can improve with time and effort”? 

Consultant: That sounds like a much more supportive thought! Focusing on the progress you can make rather than the setbacks can be powerful. How would you feel if you started to think this way more often?

User: I think it would help me feel more motivated. I might even be willing to try studying differently or ask for help if I needed it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Seeking help and experimenting with new study methods can not only enhance your learning but also build your confidence. What could be a first step you could take towards studying differently?

User: I could try forming a study group with my classmates. I’ve been hesitant to do that before.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Working with peers can provide support and different perspectives. Can we create a plan for how you might approach your classmates about forming a study group?

User: I think I could start by talking to a few friends during lunch and suggest it casually. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Keeping it casual makes it less pressure-filled. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited! I think it could be really beneficial.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, but remember, taking that first step is an important part of growth. Also, when you think back to your experience of positive feedback from your teacher, how can you use that feeling of excitement to push through your nerves?

User: I could remind myself of that encouragement and focus on the positive outcomes, like learning better and making friends. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! It anchors you in a more positive mindset. Moving forward, let’s talk about how you can maintain that excitement and positivity while facing challenges.

User: I think I could keep a journal to reflect on my feelings and note down any positive feedback I receive. 

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool! It will allow you to track your progress and remind yourself of the positive moments. How will you make time for journaling in your routine?

User: I could set aside ten minutes each evening after studying to reflect. 

Consultant: That sounds very manageable! Setting aside that time each evening can help solidify the positive progress you’re making. As we wrap up today’s session, can you share one takeaway or strategy you feel confident implementing this week?

User: I’m going to talk to my classmates about forming a study group and start journaling about my progress. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Xiao Yan! I’m proud of your commitment to taking these steps. Before we conclude, let’s reflect on how you’re feeling about these changes.

User: I feel hopeful! I’m looking forward to trying these new approaches.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you’re feeling hopeful. Remember, it's a journey, and each step counts. I look forward to our next session where we can discuss how these changes went for you. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot better. My exam results improved a bit, and I’ve been able to connect better with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Improved exam results and better relationships with classmates are significant steps forward. Can you tell me more about what you think contributed to these improvements?

User: I think I started to believe in myself a bit more. I tried to focus on the positives rather than just my struggles in studying. 

Consultant: It's great that you're starting to shift your focus! Believing in yourself can truly make a difference. How did this change in perspective affect your study habits or your interactions with classmates?

User: I felt less pressured, so I was able to study more effectively, and I also felt more confident talking to my classmates. I even joined a study group.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds fantastic! It seems like this has helped you academically and socially. How did you feel when you first joined that group?

User: I was a bit nervous at first; I worried they might think I'm not smart enough. But they were really friendly, and I felt welcomed.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous in new situations. It sounds like the group's support helped alleviate those fears. Did you notice any changes in how you approached studying after joining?

User: Yes! I started to ask more questions when I didn’t understand things. Before, I would just avoid asking because I thought I would look dumb.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Asking questions shows your willingness to learn and engage. How did it feel to start voicing your questions and concerns?

User: It felt empowering. Knowing that there are others who might have the same doubts made me feel less isolated.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Feeling connected to others can really lift the weight off your shoulders. Based on all these positive changes, what strategies do you think you can continue using to keep this momentum going?

User: I think I’ll keep studying with my classmates, and I want to practice more positive self-talk. I realize now that my thoughts can really affect my feelings.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiaoyan. Positive self-talk can help you maintain a constructive mindset. Can you think of any specific situations where you might practice this?

User: For instance, when I start feeling discouraged about my grades, I want to remind myself of the progress I've made and that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Reflecting on your progress can boost your motivation. As we wrap up, let's summarize what we’ve discussed today. What do you feel is your biggest achievement since our last session?

User: I believe my biggest achievement is overcoming my fear of connecting with others and being more open in my studies.

Consultant: That’s a remarkable achievement, Xiaoyan. You're building valuable skills that will serve you well in the future. As for the next steps, remember to keep utilizing your support system and practicing self-compassion.

User: Absolutely! Thank you for guiding me through this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It has been a pleasure to support you. As we conclude this session, remember that it's perfectly fine to come back if you need to talk or if new challenges arise. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
