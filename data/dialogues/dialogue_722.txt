Consultant: Hello Liu Hui! I'm glad you're here today. How have things been for you lately?

User: Hi. Well, I've been feeling quite down since I didn’t perform well in the college entrance exams. My confidence has taken a big hit, and I feel really awkward around my classmates who did well. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how tough that must be for you. Feeling down about the exams and seeing your classmates succeed can really weigh on your self-esteem. Can you share a bit more about how being around them makes you feel?

User: Every time I see them, I feel this intense pressure. It’s like I’m reminded of my failure. I just want to avoid those situations because I can’t handle the feelings of embarrassment and inadequacy.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like those interactions bring up some heavy feelings for you. What do you think those feelings say about your view of yourself right now?

User: I guess I feel like I’m not as good as they are. I keep thinking, "Why couldn’t I succeed like them?" It really lowers my self-esteem.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those thoughts after such a challenging experience. Let’s explore those thoughts together a bit. What specific thoughts pop up for you when you’re around your successful classmates?

User: Usually, I think things like "I’m a failure" or "I’m not capable of doing anything good." They feel really overwhelming.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be quite damaging. Can we try to look at them together? What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? And could there be another way to view your situation?

User: I mean, I guess there’s been some good things I’ve accomplished in other areas... but those thoughts feel so strong in the moment.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize those accomplishments. Sometimes, our negative thoughts can overshadow our positives. If a friend of yours were in your situation, how would you encourage her to think about her worth?

User: I would probably tell her that one exam doesn’t define her and that she has many strengths. I’d remind her of her achievements.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective. You have a supportive way of thinking for others, which is really valuable. What if you could apply that same kindness to yourself? 

User: That sounds nice, but I just don’t believe it about myself right now.

Consultant: It's okay to struggle with self-acceptance. How about we explore what small steps you can take toward believing in yourself? Maybe we can think of situations where you can practice this kinder self-talk.

User: I could try to remind myself of my successes when I think of my classmates. I should also focus on supporting myself instead of tearing myself down.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Starting with small reminders can help. What specific reminders or phrases do you think would help you feel more confident when you’re around them?

User: I might say things like “I’m doing my best” or “Everyone has their own path.” I’ll try to focus on my journey rather than compare myself.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! It seems like you are already taking steps to change how you view your situation. If those thoughts pop up again, how might you challenge them next time?

User: I could ask myself, "Is this thought really true?" or "How would I speak to a friend in my situation?" That might help me see it differently.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking those questions can really shift your perspective. As we continue our sessions, we can work on different strategies like these. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really helpful. I need to learn how to manage these feelings and thoughts better.

Consultant: I'm here to support you on that journey. It's all about finding ways to be kinder to yourself. Looking ahead, how do you want to feel when you're around your classmates again?

User: I’d like to feel more confident, less anxious, and able to interact without feeling so defeated.

Consultant: That's a great goal! We’ll work together to help you build that confidence. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but understanding where those feelings come from is an important step to overcoming them. How about we schedule our next session to keep the momentum going?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for listening and helping me think differently about this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu Hui. I appreciate you opening up today. We’ll continue to build on the progress you’ve made. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit better just talking about it. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello, Liu Hui! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious, especially when I think about interacting with my peers who did well in their exams. It's tough for me.

Consultant: I can see how those feelings can be overwhelming. You mentioned anxiety related to your peers' successes. Can you tell me more about specific situations that provoke this anxiety for you?

User: Well, when I chat with my friends who got accepted into good colleges, I just feel like I don’t belong. My confidence diminishes, and I start questioning my abilities.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, feeling disconnected during those conversations. What thoughts come to your mind in those moments when you're feeling that way?

User: I often think things like, “I’m never going to succeed like they did” or “I’m not good enough to even be part of their conversations.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to carry a lot of weight. It's understandable to feel that way in a competitive environment. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really down and anxious. I worry about what they think of me, and it makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: Avoidance is a common reaction when feeling anxious. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. How likely do you think it is that your friends see you in that negative light?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. They’ve been supportive overall, but I just can’t shake off that feeling.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your friends are supportive. This is an important aspect to consider. What if we tried to reframe those thoughts? Instead of “I’m not good enough,” could you think of a different perspective?

User: I suppose I could think, “I’m still working towards my goals, and that’s okay,” but it’s hard to believe that in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a good step toward reframing! Remember, it takes practice to change those beliefs. Can we brainstorm some practical ways you could remind yourself of that when you feel anxious again?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down my achievements and remind myself that everyone moves at their own pace.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Keeping a journal can help reaffirm your self-worth and achievements. Would you like to write down some of your recent accomplishments together now?

User: Sure, I graduated high school, and I also have been learning new skills in my free time. 

Consultant: Those are significant achievements! How do you feel now that you’ve recognized these accomplishments?

User: It makes me feel a little better. I guess I do have things to be proud of.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s important to celebrate those wins, no matter how small. Moving forward, let’s consider some social skills you might feel comfortable practicing. How do you currently approach social situations?

User: I usually just listen and try not to say much because I worry I’ll say the wrong thing.

Consultant: Listening is a valuable skill! How about we explore some conversation starters or affirmations you can use to feel more comfortable speaking up?

User: That would help, I think. Maybe simple questions about what they're studying might be a good start.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Asking about their studies can help redirect the focus and make it easier for you to engage. Remember, it’s not just about what you say, but also how you interact. How do you think you’ll feel if you practice this next time?

User: Hopefully more relaxed. If I can focus on their topics instead of my insecurities, it might work.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Let’s wrap up by discussing coping strategies you can use if anxiety arises during these interactions. What’s one thing you can remind yourself of in those moments?

User: I can tell myself, “I’m working on this,” and that’s okay.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great reminder. As we continue our sessions, we can keep building on these coping strategies. How do you feel about what we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less alone in this situation. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu Hui! Remember, it's a journey, and you’re taking steps toward feeling better about yourself. We’ll continue to work on these strategies together. Until next time!

User: Thank you, I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello Liu Hui! I’m really glad you’re here today. It sounds like you’ve been feeling pretty anxious about social situations. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling really uneasy, especially after that class gathering where I just couldn’t bring myself to talk to anyone. It made me doubt my social skills, and now I’m afraid of the next event.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you’re worried about how social situations might go. What are your thoughts about what happened at the gathering that made you feel that way?

User: I usually feel more comfortable around my classmates, but this time I felt awkward and just wanted to avoid talking. Now I’m scared of future gatherings because I don’t want to feel that way again.

Consultant: I see. It seems like that experience really impacted your confidence in social settings. You mentioned wanting to improve your social skills—what specifically would you want to learn or achieve in these situations?

User: I want to be able to talk to people more easily and not feel like they are judging me. I’d love to have better conversations and feel more confident overall.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, and it sounds very achievable with some practice. Let’s take a moment to explore what thoughts come up for you in these social situations. When you think about talking to someone, what goes through your mind?

User: I often think that they won’t be interested in what I have to say or that I’ll embarrass myself. It just feels really overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s common to have those kinds of fears. Let’s unpack that a bit. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Have there been times when you’ve successfully connected with others?

User: I guess I have had some good conversations in the past. But those moments seem to fade when I’m feeling anxious, and I tend to focus on the negatives instead.

Consultant: It sounds like you have had positive experiences that you might be overlooking when you're feeling anxious. How might thinking about those good interactions change the way you approach future situations?

User: I suppose if I remind myself of those positive experiences, it could help. But it’s hard to remember those in the moment.

Consultant: That’s very understandable. One approach we can explore is developing a few positive reminders or affirmations you can use before entering social environments. What do you think about trying that?

User: That sounds helpful! I could come up with some positive thoughts to hold onto.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s work on creating a couple of affirmations together. What’s something positive you could say to yourself about your social abilities?

User: Maybe I could say, “I’ve had good conversations before. I can do it again.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! It acknowledges your past success. How do you feel saying that to yourself might change your feelings during future gatherings?

User: It might help me feel less anxious and remember that I can connect with people. 

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let’s talk about some small steps you could take to start practicing these skills. What about setting a goal to initiate a brief conversation with someone in a safe setting? How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I could start with someone I know a bit and gradually work my way up to chatting with others.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Starting small can build your confidence over time. Which situation do you think would be the easiest for you to try this out?

User: I think I could try talking to one of my classmates after a lecture. It’s a familiar setting, and it feels less intimidating. 

Consultant: Great choice! That sounds like a perfect opportunity. How about we brainstorm what you might say or ask to start that conversation?

User: Maybe I could ask about the lecture or see if they understood something I found confusing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to initiate a conversation! It gives you both a common topic to build on. Remember, it’s about the connection, not the pressure. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel nervous but also a bit excited. I think it could be a good challenge for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about these things, but it’s also exciting! Engaging in these small challenges can lead to significant growth. Let’s set a goal to try this out by the next class. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I can try to do it by then. 

Consultant: Perfect! Before we finish today’s session, let’s recap what we’ve discussed. You have your affirmation, a plan to approach a familiar classmate, and a focus on your positive past experiences. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel more hopeful and supported. I really appreciate this guidance.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You're making great steps forward, and it’s important to acknowledge the progress you've made. Do you have any other thoughts or questions before we end our session?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. I just want to remember everything we talked about!

Consultant: Absolutely! You can always refer back to our notes. Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit anxious. Taking these incremental steps will help you feel more comfortable over time. I look forward to hearing how your conversation goes next time. 

User: Thank you! I’m excited to reflect on my experiences. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Liu Hui! I'm here to support you, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu Hui! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after participating in those new activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat better, actually. Trying those new activities gave me a small sense of achievement, but I still have moments of self-doubt and frustration.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've experienced some positive feelings from those activities! Achievements, no matter the size, can be very encouraging. Can you tell me more about those moments of self-doubt? What thoughts usually come to your mind during those times?

User: Well, sometimes I think that maybe I'm not good enough or that I won't be able to do things as well as others. It makes me feel anxious about participating in social events.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging. It sounds like you're dealing with some negative beliefs about your abilities. When those thoughts arise, how do they affect your emotions and behavior in social situations?

User: They make me feel really anxious and want to withdraw from the situation. I tend to avoid social events when I feel that way.

Consultant: I can see how that would be tough for you. It sounds like the desire to avoid those situations is strong, which keeps you from experiencing the potential joy they might bring. Have you noticed if there's a specific trigger that leads you to think those negative thoughts?

User: Yes, it's usually when I’m around people who seem more confident or accomplished than I am. I can’t help but compare myself to them.

Consultant: Comparison can be a tricky place to go. It's common to feel less than others when we make those comparisons. What do you think might happen if you tried to shift the focus from comparison to appreciating your unique strengths instead?

User: I guess I'd feel less pressure and maybe even be more present in the moment, but it's hard to remember that when I'm feeling insecure.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's not easy to shift our mindset in those moments. We can work on some strategies together to help you recognize your strengths and encourage yourself when you're feeling that way. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I do want to learn how to think more positively about myself.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's start by identifying some of your strengths and the achievements you've made, no matter how small. Can you share something you’re proud of from your recent activities?

User: I was able to lead a small group during one of the activities, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I felt good about how it went!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! Leading a group shows great initiative and capability. How could you remind yourself of this experience when you start to feel doubtful in the future?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my accomplishments and read through it when I’m feeling low?

Consultant: Absolutely! A journal can serve as a great reminder of your strengths and successes. Each time you write about an achievement, you'll reinforce a positive self-image. Would you be willing to start that this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It will be nice to look back on my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let's also explore daily affirmations. You could write some positive statements about yourself based on your experiences. Would you be open to trying that?

User: I’m a bit unsure about affirmations, but I’m willing to give it a try if it might help.

Consultant: It's perfectly fine to feel unsure at first! Affirmations can feel a bit strange initially, but they can help shift your mindset over time. Let’s create a couple together. How about something like, “I have the ability to lead and succeed” or “I am worthy of participating and enjoying social events”?

User: Those sound good! I like the idea of focusing on my ability to lead since I felt good about it.

Consultant: Excellent! Try saying those to yourself daily, especially before any social event. Now, let's talk about managing anxiety in those situations. What coping strategies can you employ when you begin to feel anxious around others?

User: I guess taking deep breaths could help, and maybe reminding myself of the positive experiences I’ve had.

Consultant: Yes! Deep breathing is a wonderful technique for calming anxiety. Pairing it with reminders of your strengths can be particularly effective. How do you feel about practicing this during our sessions?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could use the practice!

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice some deep breathing together now. Inhale deeply through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth. How did that feel?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed already!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear. Remember, combining breathing techniques with your affirmations can create a powerful tool to help you when you're feeling anxious. We can also explore more strategies in upcoming sessions. 

User: I’d really like that. I feel more hopeful about being able to handle my anxiety and comparing myself to others less.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You've made some important strides today. Let’s summarize what we’ve worked on so far. You’re going to start a journal, use daily affirmations, and practice deep breathing. How are you feeling about making these changes?

User: I feel excited and a bit less overwhelmed just talking about it. I think I can keep it up!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Remember, change takes time and practice, but you’re on the right path. In our next session, we can check in on how these strategies are working for you. Keep believing in yourself, Liu Hui!

User: Thank you! I’m grateful for your support. I really feel like I’m starting to see things differently.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. I look forward to our next conversation. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself!

User: Thanks again! I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Liu Hui! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident lately. I started making new friends in my club activities, which has helped me feel more relaxed and cheerful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive changes. Can you tell me more about how these new friendships have impacted your mood and confidence?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel more comfortable in social situations now. I used to avoid many activities, but now I actually look forward to hanging out with my new friends.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really enjoying these social connections! How do you think these experiences have influenced your overall self-esteem?

User: I think it's made me realize that I can engage with others and that they appreciate my company. It’s a nice feeling to belong to a group.

Consultant: Belonging to a group can be such a powerful boost for our self-esteem. What strategies or skills do you think have helped you in building these connections?

User: I’ve been trying to be more open and approachable. I also remind myself not to overthink social interactions, which used to make me anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Being open and reducing overthinking can really help in forming meaningful connections. Have you noticed any specific situations where these skills made a difference for you?

User: Yes! Just the other day, I started a conversation with someone I had never spoken to before, and it went really well! We ended up sharing a lot and even made plans to meet again.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Liu Hui! It must have felt rewarding to initiate that conversation. How did it feel afterwards?

User: I felt really proud of myself! I couldn't believe I actually did it without feeling too anxious.

Consultant: Feeling proud is a wonderful affirmation of your progress. How do you want to build on this positive experience moving forward?

User: I’d like to keep practicing these skills and try to connect with more people. I think that could help me further boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! As we discuss your experiences, let’s think about creating a plan to maintain and enhance these new skills. How can you start documenting your positive social interactions?

User: I could keep a journal to write about my experiences and the feelings I had during those interactions. I think this would really help me reflect on my progress.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a great idea! Reflecting on your experiences can help solidify those positive memories. What specific thoughts or feelings do you want to focus on when you write in your journal?

User: I want to capture the moments when I felt confident or where I overcame anxiety. Also, noting down what went well in conversations.

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan. Focusing on those achievements will reinforce your confidence. How often do you think you could write in your journal?

User: Maybe a few times a week, especially after social activities. I want to keep it regular but not pressure myself too much.

Consultant: Finding a balance is crucial! By writing a few times a week, you can effectively track your growth without feeling overwhelmed. How do you think sharing your journal observations with a friend could further support you in this process?

User: Sharing it with a friend sounds helpful! They could provide encouragement and maybe even share their own experiences, too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing experiences can foster support and connection, reinforcing your learning. Are there any particular friends you have in mind to share this with?

User: I have a couple of friends from the club who seem very supportive. I think I’ll ask them if they’d like to share thoughts about our experiences together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Building a support system can make the journey even more enjoyable. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the plan we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel really good about it! I think keeping a journal and sharing with friends will help me stay on track with my confidence and social skills.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel positive about it! Remember, it’s all about steady progress. Let's continue to build on these skills in future sessions. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’m excited to keep working on this!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu Hui! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth. I believe you’re on an inspiring journey, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. See you soon!

User: See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu Hui! It's great to see you again. I’m happy to hear about the progress you've made. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better. I think talking to my family about my feelings really helped me. I feel more stable and confident now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the support from your family has made a significant difference. Can you share more about how your confidence has changed? 

User: Well, before, I was anxious about expressing myself, but now I feel more comfortable speaking up. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It sounds like you've really tapped into your ability to communicate your feelings. What specific changes have you noticed in your daily interactions or activities?

User: I’ve been more active in social situations and even joined a study group. I feel like I can contribute more now.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Engaging in social activities can significantly improve our mental well-being. How has being part of the study group impacted your motivation and focus on your studies?

User: I feel more motivated when I'm studying with others. It encourages me to stay on track and reduces my procrastination.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It seems like the group dynamic helps you maintain accountability. Have you also noticed any changes in how you approach your study sessions?

User: Yes, I’ve started setting clear goals for each session. I used to just sit down and hope for the best, but now I plan what I want to accomplish.

Consultant: Setting clear goals is a powerful strategy. It allows you to work with intention. How do you feel emotionally when you achieve these goals?

User: I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride, which is really motivating. It encourages me to keep going.

Consultant: That’s an excellent feedback loop! Accomplishing your goals reinforces positive feelings. How do you plan to maintain this motivation in the long run?

User: I was thinking of creating a weekly review where I reflect on my progress and adjust my goals if needed. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Regular reviews can help keep you aligned with your objectives. Have you considered how you might address any challenges that come your way during this process?

User: I suppose I could write down potential obstacles and how I might handle them. I want to be prepared.

Consultant: That proactive approach is commendable! Identifying challenges ahead of time can reduce their impact when they arise. What kind of obstacles do you think you might face?

User: I guess sometimes I might feel overwhelmed with assignments or pressure from exams.

Consultant: Acknowledging that pressure is crucial. When those feelings arise, what strategies could you use to manage them?

User: I could take breaks, practice mindfulness, or even talk to someone if I need to. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breaks and mindfulness can help ground you. Reflecting on our previous discussions, how do you feel about your emotional responses during high-pressure situations now compared to before?

User: I think I'm handling them better overall. I try to remind myself that it’s okay to feel stressed but that I can manage it.

Consultant: Recognizing that it's okay to feel stressed is a significant step. You've come a long way in understanding your emotions. To maintain this growth trajectory, what habits or practices do you feel are essential for your ongoing development?

User: I want to continue journaling my thoughts and feelings, stay connected with my family, and keep participating in the study group.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent commitments! Journaling can provide valuable insight into your thoughts, while family and peer support will keep you grounded. As we wrap up today, what would you consider your biggest takeaway from our sessions together?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I have the tools to manage my emotions and that I have support around me. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Liu Hui! You've built a resilience that will serve you well. How do you envision using these tools going forward?

User: I plan to use them in my daily life, especially during stressful times, and I'll remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: That’s a great plan. Remember, you’ve developed a strong foundation. If you ever feel overwhelmed, revisiting our strategies can be helpful. This will be our last session for now, but you can always reach out if you need further guidance. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support throughout this process. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress. Keep nurturing your growth and well-being. If you need anything in the future, don't hesitate to come back. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. Take care!
