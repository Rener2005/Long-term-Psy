Consultant: Hello Gina! I’m really glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I don’t know... I’m just really upset. My sister just got married, and I feel all over the place. It’s like I don’t know where I belong anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like your sister’s wedding has stirred up a lot of emotions for you. Can you tell me more about what you’re feeling and why it might affect you so strongly?

User: I guess I just feel abandoned. She was always there for me, and now it feels like she’s gone. I get angry sometimes, and then I feel sad. I don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: That feeling of abandonment is really tough, especially since you’ve had so many changes in your life. It’s completely understandable to feel angry and sad. When you think about your sister getting married, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not important anymore, like I was just an afterthought. I don’t want to feel this way. 

Consultant: It’s painful to feel like you’re not important, especially in a close relationship. That thought can really impact how you feel about yourself and your relationship with your sister. Have you talked about these feelings with anyone, like your parents?

User: Not really. I don’t want them to think I’m just being dramatic. They have their own things to worry about.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how others perceive your feelings, but expressing your emotions could help you feel a bit lighter. You mentioned feeling dramatic; what if this isn't just drama but a genuine feeling that needs to be acknowledged?

User: I never thought of it that way. Maybe it is important... but it feels embarrassing to admit it.

Consultant: It's not embarrassing to feel how you feel, Gina. Your emotions are valid, and acknowledging them is a big step. How do you think your emotions are affecting your behavior lately?

User: I snap at people a lot. I don't mean to, but it just happens. I feel so overwhelmed inside.

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed can certainly lead to unexpected reactions. It’s like a pressure cooker inside. Let’s explore those moments when you feel the need to snap at others. What thoughts race through your mind when that happens?

User: I don’t know... It’s like I’m frustrated and don't feel like anyone understands me. I just want to scream sometimes.

Consultant: That deep frustration can build up and spill over, especially when you feel misunderstood. Let’s try to identify and challenge those thoughts. What if someone were to truly understand you? How would that change how you react?

User: Maybe I wouldn't get so worked up. I’d feel heard. But it’s hard to believe anyone really gets me.

Consultant: It can be hard to trust that someone understands you, especially with your past experiences. What if we considered the possibility that your feelings are understandable and someone could relate to what you’re going through?

User: I guess it’s possible. It just doesn’t feel like it sometimes.

Consultant: That uncertainty is normal. Let’s think about the new belief: “It’s okay to feel upset about my sister’s wedding, and I can share that without being dramatic.” How does that resonate with you?

User: That sounds better. It makes me feel like it’s okay to just be me for a moment. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's important to allow yourself to feel without judgment. Now, let’s think about small steps you could take to express those feelings, maybe starting with writing them down or talking to someone you trust.

User: Writing sounds okay. I think I can try that. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s a safe way to process your thoughts. How about also thinking of a time when you felt close to your sister? What did that feel like?

User: We used to have movie nights. I miss those. It made me feel safe.

Consultant: Those moments brought you safety and joy. Focusing on those memories can help remind you of your connection. How could you recreate that feeling now, even if it’s different?

User: Maybe I could talk to her about how I feel? I just don’t know how. 

Consultant: That could be a wonderful way to reconnect and be open about your feelings. You could start by sharing a memory you cherish about your time together. Would that feel manageable for you?

User: Yeah, I think so. It might help.

Consultant: Let’s set that as a goal for this week—a conversation that feels authentic. As we wrap up, what’s one thing you can take away from our session today?

User: I guess it’s okay to feel how I feel. And talking can help.

Consultant: Absolutely, Gina, acknowledging your feelings is so important. You’ve taken a significant step today, and I’m proud of you for being open. We can continue exploring this in future sessions. 

User: Thank you. I feel a little lighter now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, you’re not alone in this. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Gina! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I don't know... I just feel more confused. My sister got married, and I thought it would be okay, but I just can't help feeling angry and sad about it.

Consultant: It sounds like your sister's marriage has brought up some difficult emotions for you. Can you share more about what you feel when you think about her getting married?

User: I just feel... rejected, I guess. Like I don’t belong in this family. It’s like everyone is moving on, and I'm just stuck here.

Consultant: That’s a really tough feeling to carry. It's understandable to feel left out when someone close to you has a big change in their life. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when these feelings come up?

User: I think things like, "Why can't I be happy for her?" or "I must be the problem." It makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It seems that there are some harsh judgments you're placing on yourself. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are the problem?

User: I don’t know… I just feel like I mess everything up. I’m always angry and rude, and I don’t trust anyone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by these emotions. But let's consider—could there be other explanations for your feelings besides believing you're the problem?

User: Maybe... but it feels so real. It’s hard to think that way.

Consultant: I understand. It can be difficult to shift our perspective, especially when emotions are high. If a friend felt this way, how would you encourage them to think about it?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to feel sad and that it’s not their fault. But it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful perspective you could share with yourself. It's okay to feel sad, and it doesn't define your worth. Let's practice replacing those harsh judgments you have about yourself with more compassionate thoughts. Can you try telling yourself something kinder when those thoughts arise?

User: I can try saying it’s okay to feel this way and that I’m still trying my best.

Consultant: Yes, that sounds like a good start! It’s important to recognize that you’re going through a lot, and it's okay to be gentle with yourself. Now, let’s talk about your relationship with your adoptive parents. How has that been since the wedding?

User: It's been a bit weird. I just feel like they don't really understand me. They seem happy, but I don't know how to express what I'm feeling.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating, especially when you need support. Can we explore together how you might express your feelings to them? What would you want them to know?

User: I want them to know that I feel left out and that I don’t want to lose them. But I don't want them to think I'm ungrateful.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how they might perceive your feelings. However, sharing your emotions can strengthen your relationship. What if you approached them by saying you appreciate them and also need them to understand how you feel? 

User: That could work. I think I could tell them I appreciate what they do, but I feel scared about my place in the family.

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to frame it! It expresses your gratitude while also being honest about your feelings. How does that thought make you feel?

User: A bit relieved, actually. It feels less scary when I think about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, expressing your feelings is a step toward healing and connection. We can practice this together. What small step do you think you could take in the coming days to open up about your feelings?

User: Maybe I could write them a letter. That way, I can think about what I want to say without getting too emotional.

Consultant: Writing a letter sounds like a great idea! It gives you the space to express yourself without the immediate pressure of a face-to-face conversation. When you're ready to share it, how do you think they might respond?

User: I hope they’ll understand. I just don’t want them to be mad at me for feeling this way.

Consultant: It’s natural to fear their reaction, but know that their response might be supportive if you frame it honestly. Remember, your feelings are valid. How can we prepare for a possible range of responses from them?

User: I guess I could remind myself that people have different reactions and that their initial response doesn't define how much they care!

Consultant: That’s right, Gina. It’s so valuable to keep that in mind. You are taking brave steps to express your feelings, and whatever their response, you are still taking care of yourself. What else can we work on today to help you through this process?

User: I just feel like there’s this heavy cloud over me. I want to fight through it, but it’s hard.

Consultant: It's great that you're expressing this feeling. Sometimes, just acknowledging the heaviness can be a first step. What activities or resources could help you feel a bit lighter during tough times?

User: I like to draw, but I haven't done it in a while. I used to feel better when I created something.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful outlet for your emotions! Would you be willing to make time for it in the coming week? It may help you process what you're feeling.

User: I can try that. Maybe it can help me sort through my feelings about all of this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Art can be a powerful way to express what’s in your heart. As we close today, let’s summarize what you plan to do moving forward. 

User: I’ll write a letter to my parents about how I’m feeling, and I’ll start drawing again.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! You’re taking important steps toward understanding your emotions and creating a stronger connection with your family. I’m proud of you, Gina. Keep taking it one step at a time, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit better talking about it. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this journey. I'm looking forward to hearing how things go next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Gina! I'm really glad you made it today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really angry and hopeless. Especially since my sister got married. It just reminds me that I can’t be accepted by anyone, not even my classmates. They laugh at me and make me feel like I don’t belong.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Gina. It’s understandable to feel that way considering your experiences. How did you feel when you were being laughed at by your classmates?

User: I felt like I wanted to explode. I just wanted to yell at them or hit something. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of getting angry and then feeling even more alone.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would react that way, especially when you feel so isolated. Can you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when those situations happen?

User: I think maybe something like, “They’ll never accept me” or “I’m always going to be an outsider.” It feels like there’s no hope for me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really painful, Gina. We can work on understanding and challenging some of those negative thoughts together. For instance, can you think of any evidence that might contradict the idea that you won’t ever be accepted?

User: I guess I do get along well with my sister and her friends. But when I’m at school, it just feels different. It feels like nobody likes me there.

Consultant: It seems like you have some positive relationships, which is great! School can be a different environment, and those feelings can be overwhelming. What if we explored ways to express how you’re feeling or perhaps respond differently to those classmates? 

User: I don’t know… what could I even say? I usually just end up snapping at them.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction, especially when we feel cornered. But how do you think they would react if you tried to express your feelings instead? For example, saying something like, “It really hurts when you laugh at me”?

User: I don’t think it would change anything. They’d probably just laugh more. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but expressing yourself might shift the way they see you. Sometimes, confronting someone calmly can surprise them. Would you be willing to try saying something like that in a safe scenario perhaps, even with someone you trust?

User: Maybe… I could try it with my sister. She usually understands me.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Talking to your sister could help you practice expressing your feelings. How do you think that would make you feel?

User: I think it would help. At least I’d feel less like I have to hide my feelings all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing your feelings can lighten the load and help you feel more connected. Besides talking, have you thought about ways to handle it when you’re feeling angry? 

User: I usually just keep it all in or act out. I can’t really think of any other way.

Consultant: It’s common to feel stuck. How about we try exploring some activities that help you release that anger in healthier ways? Maybe going for a run or doing some art to express how you feel?

User: I like drawing. Maybe I could draw whenever I feel angry.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Art is a powerful way to express emotions. You might find that it helps reduce some tension. Let’s also think about a situation where you felt calm. Can you remember a time when you felt safe and at peace?

User: Maybe when I’m alone in my room drawing. It feels good there.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Creating a calm space for yourself is important. We can also work on returning to that feeling when things outside feel overwhelming. How about visualizing that safe space when you feel anger rising?

User: I could try that. It sounds better than just getting angry.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualizing that peaceful place can be a great tool. Let’s summarize what we've discussed today—practicing expressing your feelings, using art to release anger, and visualizing your calm space. Do you feel ready to try some of these strategies?

User: Yes, I think I can give it a shot. It’s nice to talk about this. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Gina! It takes time and patience, but every small step you take is progress. When we meet next, we can talk about how those strategies worked for you. 

User: I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for listening!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Gina! I believe you’re on the right path. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need to chat before our next session. Have a good week!
###################
Consultant: Hi Gina! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after participating in the social skills group at school? 

User: Hi. I think I've been doing a bit better, but it’s still a challenge. I’m trying to use what I learned about respect and support in my interactions, but sometimes I feel unsure about it.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're attempting to apply what you've learned! Can you share an example of a situation where you tried to use those skills recently? 

User: Well, I spoke to a classmate the other day. I tried to listen to her more and not interrupt. But I felt nervous, like I was being judged. 

Consultant: It sounds like you made an effort to listen, which is wonderful! Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when you’re trying something new. What thoughts went through your mind during that conversation that made you feel judged? 

User: I kept thinking that she might not like me or think I'm weird for being quiet. I don't know, I guess I just felt like I had to impress her.

Consultant: That’s a common thought to have, wanting to be liked. Let’s explore that a bit. How likely do you think it is that she judged you negatively for being quiet? 

User: Maybe it’s not that likely? I don't know her well enough to know what she’s thinking. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Gina. Often we assume the worst without real evidence. If a friend were in your position and had those thoughts, what advice would you give them? 

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry so much about what others think and just be themselves. 

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! We can apply the same principle to you. Remember, just by being genuine, you are allowing others to see the real you, which can help build stronger connections. How would it feel to shift your focus from impressing others to being your authentic self in social situations? 

User: I think that would help! It sounds less stressful. 

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! Let’s put that into practice. What’s a safe social situation you could approach this week where you can try being your authentic self? 

User: Maybe I can talk to my sister’s friends when they come over. I feel kind of comfortable around them. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! You could start by asking them about a topic you all enjoy. How do you feel about trying that? 

User: I can definitely try that. I think it would be nice to chat about something fun. 

Consultant: Great! Keep in mind to focus on listening and responding authentically. Afterward, we can discuss how that went. How do you feel being proactive about this? 

User: It feels good! I’m a bit nervous, but also excited. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Embracing both feelings shows you’re moving forward. Remember, every small step counts. How about we plan to talk again after your conversation? You can share how it went and what you learned. 

User: Yes, I’d like that! 

Consultant: Perfect! Prior to our next session, I encourage you to reflect on any positive moments during that interaction. Is there anything else on your mind today? 

User: Not really, I think I’m good for now. 

Consultant: That’s okay! I appreciate you being open today, Gina. Just know that it’s perfectly fine to have ups and downs as you practice these new skills. You’re doing great! 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful. 

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! Let that hope guide you as you continue exploring social interactions. We’ll catch up next time to discuss how it went, alright?

User: Sounds good! See you next time. 

Consultant: See you soon, Gina! Take care until then.
###################
Consultant: Hello Gina! It’s great to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've actually been feeling a bit better. I've made some new friends, and I enjoyed spending time with them. But sometimes, I still get really angry for no reason.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you're feeling better overall and that you've had some positive experiences with your new friends. It's completely normal to experience anger or frustration sometimes. Can you tell me more about what triggers that anger? 

User: Well, sometimes I just feel left out, or when things don’t go my way, I get upset. It’s like a switch flips, and I don't know why.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Gina. It’s important to recognize those feelings. It might help to talk about what goes through your mind in those moments you're feeling upset. Do you remember any specific thoughts you have when you feel that anger rising?

User: I guess I think that nobody wants me around or that I'm a burden. It makes me feel really alone.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like those thoughts can be quite heavy for you. Let’s examine those thoughts together. Do you think they are always true? 

User: I don’t know. Maybe not always. Sometimes my friends do include me, but when I'm upset, I just forget that.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. It seems like when you're angry, it can cloud your perspective on the positive interactions you’ve had. What do you think could help you remember those moments of inclusion when you start to feel anger or frustration?

User: Maybe if I write it down or talk about it, it could help. 

Consultant: Writing it down could be a great strategy! Keeping a journal of those positive moments can help you counteract those negative feelings. How about we create a plan together for when you start feeling that way again? 

User: Yeah, I’d like that! 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s outline a few steps. First, when you feel angry, take a moment to pause and breathe. Next, can you remind yourself of a time when you felt included? What would you say to yourself in that moment?

User: I could say, "Remember when I had fun with my friends last weekend?" That helps. 

Consultant: That’s a great reminder! Recalling those positive experiences can be really empowering. How do you feel about this strategy we've just created? 

User: I think it could work. It's really nice to have a plan instead of just letting the anger take over. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Gina. Having a plan can give you a sense of control. Now, besides anger, how have you been feeling about your friendships more generally? 

User: I feel good about my friends. They make me laugh, and I like being around them. 

Consultant: That's fantastic! It sounds like your relationships are starting to bring you joy. Can you tell me about your interactions with your friends that make you feel happy?

User: They include me in games and activities. It feels nice to be wanted.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Feeling wanted is so important for building self-esteem. How does that make you feel about yourself when you’re around them?

User: I feel more confident. I mean, that’s new for me. 

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Gina! Confidence can really change how we see ourselves and our place in social situations. What would you like to focus on next to continue building that confidence?

User: I want to learn how to communicate better. Sometimes I don’t know what to say and feel awkward.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Communication can be tricky sometimes. How about we explore some conversations you’ve had recently? Was there a moment you felt you could have expressed yourself better?

User: Yes, during lunch, I couldn’t find the right words when my friends were joking. I just sat there and smiled.

Consultant: It’s still positive that you were smiling and engaged! Let’s practice some conversation starters you could use when you feel unsure. What topics do you enjoy talking about with your friends?

User: I like talking about movies and games. 

Consultant: Perfect! We can brainstorm some questions related to those topics. For example, you could ask, "What’s your favorite movie?" or "Have you played any good games lately?" How does that sound?

User: That sounds easy enough! 

Consultant: Great! Keep those questions in mind for your next hangout. Practicing small steps can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the strategies we discussed and your progress with confidence?

User: I feel good! It's nice to have ways to handle my feelings and talk to my friends. 

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that! Remember, building confidence and communication skills takes time, but you're already making progress. Let's check in next time about how these strategies have worked for you. 

User: I will! Thank you for your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Gina. I’m proud of you! See you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Gina! It’s great to see you again. Today, I’d like to summarize and evaluate your progress across various areas. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. I'm trying to be more positive about things. But sometimes, I still get upset, especially thinking about my sister getting married.

Consultant: I see. It's understandable to have mixed feelings about your sister's wedding, especially considering how close you two are. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers your feelings when you think about her getting married?

User: Well, I’m happy for her, but I also feel left out sometimes. It reminds me of my past and the family I wished I had. I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I can't help it.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a conflict between your happiness for her and your feelings of exclusion. That makes sense, given your past experiences. Let’s explore this further: when you feel left out, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I start thinking that I don't belong anywhere and that maybe people will abandon me like they did before. It makes me feel really anxious and angry.

Consultant: Those feelings of not belonging and fears of abandonment are significant. It's important to address those thoughts. Can we try to challenge the idea that you don't belong? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this thought?

User: I guess I do belong here with my foster parents, and my sister and I are really close. They care about me, I know that. But sometimes, it just feels different.

Consultant: It’s good to acknowledge that you belong with your foster family and that they care about you. What would it look like for you to hold onto that thought when you're feeling anxious or angry?

User: I think I just need to remind myself that it’s okay to be happy for my sister and still feel my own feelings too. It doesn’t have to be one or the other.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization, Gina. Embracing both feelings is indeed a healthy approach. How do you think you can practice this reminder in your daily life?

User: Maybe I could write it down or talk to someone when I start feeling low. I really want to keep improving.

Consultant: Writing it down sounds like a great strategy! You could create a list of positive affirmations about your place in your family. Would you like to try that this week?

User: Yes, I will. I think it would help me focus on the good things.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let’s also talk about your progress in managing your emotions and social skills. How have you been doing with maintaining harmony at home and in school?

User: I've been trying hard! I’ve talked to a few friends at school and even joined a club. It feels good to be part of something.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Joining a club is a great way to build connections. What have you enjoyed about being part of that group?

User: I love that we all work together on projects. It distracts me from my worries, and I feel like I belong there too.

Consultant: It sounds like you are building a sense of belonging in this new environment, which is wonderful. How do you think you can continue to foster these connections with your peers?

User: I could invite some of them to hang out after school. I think it would help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Inviting friends to hang out is a wonderful idea. It not only helps strengthen your friendships but also gives you more opportunities to express yourself. Have you considered any activities you’d like to do together?

User: Maybe we could go to the movies or have a game night. I think that would be fun.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent plans! Not only will you enjoy those activities, but they will also help you connect more with your friends. How does that make you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I feel excited! I’m nervous too, but I really want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Remember, you’re taking positive steps towards building deeper connections. What can you tell yourself to ease that nervousness?

User: I guess I can tell myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that my friends will understand!

Consultant: Exactly, acknowledging your nervousness while reminding yourself of their support is an excellent strategy. Now, as we prepare to conclude today’s session, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made and outline some strategies for continued growth.

User: Okay, I think I’ve made strides in feeling more confident and being part of a group. I want to keep working on those reminders about belonging. 

Consultant: You’ve done incredibly well, Gina. It’s important to recognize your progress in emotional management and relationship building. Moving forward, maintaining those positive reminders and social connections will be key to your growth. How do you feel about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel good about them. I believe they’ll help me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, even when challenges arise, you have the tools and support to navigate them. If you ever need guidance, feel free to reach out. This wraps up our consultation, and I wish you the best on your journey ahead!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and support.
