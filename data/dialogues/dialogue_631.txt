Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've been facing some challenges lately. Can you share with me how you've been feeling?

User: Hi. I feel really frustrated. Some classmates just don't get me, and I end up getting into fights. Just recently, I had an argument with Xiaoya, and now some parents want me to get kicked out of school. It's not fair!

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like you're feeling really upset about the situation with your classmates and the school's response. I'm here to help you understand these feelings better. Can you tell me more about what happened with Xiaoya?

User: Well, she accused me of something I didn’t do, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I yelled at her, and we pushed each other. Now everyone thinks I'm the bad guy.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really intense moment for you. When you felt accused, what thoughts went through your mind in that moment? Did anything in particular make you feel like yelling was the only option?

User: I just felt like nobody understood me, and I thought if I didn’t show I was strong, people would just walk all over me. So, I got angry.

Consultant: I understand. It feels like you might believe that showing strength through anger is the way to defend yourself. It’s a common reaction, especially when we feel misunderstood. What do you think might happen if you tried to express how you felt without using anger?

User: I don’t know. I just think they wouldn’t listen. It’s like every time I try to talk, they just roll their eyes or ignore me.

Consultant: That sounds really disheartening. Feeling ignored can make anyone feel even more isolated. What if we explored some different ways to communicate your feelings that might help others understand you better? Would you be open to that?

User: I guess. But it’s hard. I just don’t know how to talk without getting mad first.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It might take practice, but it can be done! Let's think of some situations where you felt misunderstood. How could you approach those situations differently if you wanted to express your feelings without getting frustrated?

User: Maybe I could just explain why I was upset instead of yelling? But I’m not sure they would care.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Explaining your feelings calmly could give them a chance to understand you better. Even if it feels hard, remember that you have every right to express how you feel. What could you say if you were to speak to Xiaoya again in a calm way?

User: I guess I could say I didn’t like being accused and it hurt my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a really good way to put it. Sharing how you feel can sometimes open up a better conversation. If she knows how upset her words made you, she might respond differently. How does that make you feel, thinking about that approach?

User: It makes me feel a little better, like maybe she’d understand. But what if she doesn’t?

Consultant: It can be tough to think about different outcomes. Even if she doesn’t react the way you hope, you will have expressed yourself honestly. That’s a positive step. Let’s practice how you might say that to her. Would you like to try it together?

User: Alright. I can try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play it together. You can start by saying, “Xiaoya, I want to talk about what happened…” 

User: “Xiaoya, I want to talk about what happened... I felt really hurt when you accused me.” 

Consultant: That’s excellent! You’re showing your feelings and opening the door for a conversation. How did it feel to say that?

User: It feels kind of vulnerable but also like it might help.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s normal to feel vulnerable when you’re honest about your feelings. This is a big step towards understanding each other better. What do you think could be your next step in trying this out?

User: I could try talking to her tomorrow and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a plan! It’s important to remember that change takes time. It might be helpful to focus on how you feel throughout the conversation too. If you start to feel angry, you can pause and take a deep breath. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for being willing to try this, Xiaoke. Remember, it’s all about practice. Next time we talk, I’d love to hear how things went with Xiaoya. Are there any other situations or feelings you'd like to discuss today?

User: No, I think that’s it for now. But I’ll think about our conversation.

Consultant: That’s perfectly fine! Take your time to reflect. You’ve made some progress today, and it’s great to see you willing to explore new ways of communicating. I look forward to hearing how it goes. 

User: Thanks. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoke! Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need someone to talk to. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I’m glad to see you today. Let's talk about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been going on at school?

User: Hi. I feel really lonely at school. I keep having fights with my classmates, and now I think everyone is mad at me. I don’t really know how to talk to them without getting angry.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it’s understandable to feel isolated in that situation. Let's explore your feelings a bit more. Can you tell me what it feels like when you think about your classmates and the fights?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and upset. I just want them to stop being mean and notice me, but when I try to say something, I end up getting really mad instead.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of frustration built up for you. You want to express yourself, but it often leads to anger. What do you think stops you from expressing your feelings calmly?

User: I guess I don’t know how to say what I really want to say without getting in a fight. Sometimes I just want to shout.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel that way when things are overwhelming. Today, we can practice some new ways to communicate your feelings without raising your voice. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think I’d like to try, but I’m not sure if it will work. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel unsure. Let’s start with something simple. When you feel angry or frustrated, instead of shouting, you can use “I” statements like “I feel upset when…” Can you think of a time this week when you felt upset with someone? 

User: Well, my friend Sam took my pencil without asking, and I felt really mad about that.

Consultant: Great example! How might you express that feeling using an “I” statement?

User: Um, I guess I could say, “I feel upset when you take my things without asking”?

Consultant: That’s exactly it! Saying “I feel upset” helps your friend understand how you feel instead of thinking you’re attacking them. Would you like to practice saying that aloud?

User: Okay, let me try. “I feel upset when you take my things without asking.” 

Consultant: That’s perfect, Xiao Ke! How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt a little better. But what if my friend gets angry when I say it?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sometimes people react unexpectedly. If that happens, you can remind yourself that you’re expressing your feelings, and you deserve to be heard. What do you think you might do if Sam got upset?

User: Maybe I could stay calm and ask him to talk about it?

Consultant: Yes! Staying calm can help deescalate the situation. You might say, “Can we talk about this?” How would that make you feel?

User: I think I would feel a bit more in control, but still a bit nervous.

Consultant: And that’s completely understandable. It’s all part of learning. What if we think of a safe place or a safe way you can practice this outside of school, like at home with your parents? 

User: I could practice with my mom. She’s usually pretty calm.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Practicing with someone supportive can really help reinforce your confidence. Maybe you could even role-play different scenarios. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I think I’d feel less scared if I practiced first.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building these skills takes time and practice, but you’re already taking the right steps. What will you tell your mom when you practice?

User: I’ll tell her I want to learn how to say what I feel without getting angry.

Consultant: That’s a great way to start the conversation! You’re on the right track. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today. Can you remind me of one thing you learned that you want to use?

User: I learned to use “I” statements to say how I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to express them. How confident do you feel about trying this out with your mom this week? 

User: I feel a bit more confident now, but still a little nervous.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal, Xiao Ke. Just take it one step at a time. And if you feel stuck, you can always reach out for help. We can work on it together more next time. 

User: Okay! I will try my best.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiao Ke. You’re doing great! Next time we meet, we can talk about how it went. And remember, I’m here to help you along the way.

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Don’t forget to practice, and I’ll see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we begin, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been trying to handle things better. I've been using the communication techniques we talked about, but sometimes I still feel really frustrated when things don’t go as planned.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're applying the communication techniques! Feeling frustrated is totally normal, especially when you're trying to change your behavior. Can you share with me a situation where you felt frustrated recently?

User: Well, there was this time when my classmates didn't want to play the game I suggested during recess. I felt like I couldn't communicate well, and I ended up getting angry again.

Consultant: I can see how that might have made you feel really upset. It's tough when others don't respond the way we hope. What thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: I thought that they just didn't like my ideas. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend, which made me even more mad.

Consultant: That thought can really amplify your feelings of frustration and loneliness. It sounds like there’s a belief that your ideas aren't valued. How do you think that belief impacts your behavior in those situations?

User: I guess I feel like I have to be aggressive to get people to listen to me. But that just makes things worse.

Consultant: Absolutely, feeling like you need to be aggressive to be heard can create a cycle of conflict. Let's talk about that feeling. What could be an alternative thought that might help you feel less frustrated when your ideas aren’t accepted?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s okay for people to have different opinions and that it doesn't mean they don’t like me.

Consultant: That sounds like a much healthier perspective! Reminding yourself that differences in opinion are normal can really help shift how you feel. How would that change your response in future situations?

User: If I think that way, maybe I wouldn't feel so angry and I could try to find something else we could all play together.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on collaboration rather than confrontation can lead to more positive experiences. What steps can you take to practice this new thought during your next interaction with your classmates?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay if they don’t want to play my game. I could also ask them what game they would like to play instead.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Xiao Ke! It shows that you are willing to compromise and be understanding. Now, how do you feel about testing this out next time you’re at school?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful that it might work. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about trying something new. It's a sign that you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s think about ways to manage that nervousness when you encounter a difficult situation.

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths before I speak to them. That might help me calm down.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy! It can help center you and reduce anxiety. We could also practice how to initiate conversations with your classmates. Would you like to try it now?

User: Sure! What should I say?

Consultant: You could start by saying something like, "Hey everyone, I have a game in mind, but I'm also curious about what games you all like to play. What do you think?" This opens the door for collaboration.

User: I like that! It sounds friendly.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a friendly approach that encourages sharing ideas. How do you feel about practicing that approach?

User: I feel good about it! I think I can try that.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s okay if everything doesn’t go perfectly. What’s important is that you’re giving it a try. How can you celebrate when you use this approach successfully?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with a small treat or something fun with my family!

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Celebrating your efforts can reinforce your progress. Before we wrap up, let's reflect on the positive experiences you've had since we started these sessions. What have you noticed about your interactions that makes you feel proud?

User: I think I'm getting better at talking without shouting. I actually had a nice conversation last week with a friend about something that upset me, and I didn’t get angry!

Consultant: That's a significant achievement, Xiao Ke! It shows that you’re growing and developing your skills. How can you continue to build on this progress?

User: I want to keep talking calmly and listening to others more. I really want to keep improving.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! You're on the right track. Remember, change takes time, and you're doing great. Let’s meet again next week to see how things go. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Ke! Happy to see your progress. Remember to take things one step at a time. See you next week!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm really glad to see you here for our session today. I'm looking forward to hearing about how you've been feeling lately, especially after your recent group activities. Can you share how that experience went for you?

User: Hi! The group activity was actually quite fun. I felt happy playing games with others and working together. But sometimes, when things don’t go my way, I still get really upset and want to fight.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you enjoyed the positive interactions during the games, but you're also struggling with feeling upset when something doesn’t go as planned. Can you tell me what kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you feel like you want to fight?

User: When I feel upset, I think that everyone is against me or not listening. I just feel like I have to show them I'm strong, like I can't let them push me around.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiao Ke. It sounds like you feel the need to defend yourself to show strength. When you think that others are against you, how does that make you feel inside?

User: It makes me really angry and anxious. I feel like no one understands me. 

Consultant: Anger and anxiety can be very overwhelming. Let's think about those moments when you feel like everyone is against you. Are there times when that thought might not be completely true?

User: Maybe... but when I’m angry, I can’t see it. I just want to react.

Consultant: I understand. When you're in that angry moment, it can be hard to see other perspectives. What if we worked on finding ways to pause and think before reacting? How do you think that could help you?

User: I guess if I think before I react, I might not end up fighting. Maybe I could say something instead.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Using your words can help express how you feel without resorting to fighting. Let’s come up with some phrases you could use when you start feeling angry. What are some things you could say?

User: Maybe I could say "I don’t like what happened" or "Can we try that again?" 

Consultant: Those are excellent phrases, Xiao Ke! They show how you feel and encourage a discussion instead of a fight. How confident do you feel using those phrases if a similar situation arises again?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I want to try.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about trying something new. How about setting a small goal for our next session? We can practice using those phrases together, and you can tell me how it went. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes! I will try to use those phrases next time!

Consultant: That's wonderful! I'm really proud of you for wanting to try. In the meantime, let's think about how else you can enjoy group activities without feeling like you need to fight. Are there other ways to join in and connect with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could help out with some games or just cheer for others. I like when people have fun together!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Cheering for others and helping out can build a connection without conflict. What would it feel like to participate like that?

User: It feels nice! I like to see everyone happy, and I want to be happy too.

Consultant: Happiness in connecting with others is so important! Let’s create a little plan for your next group activity. You could help with the games and practice using your phrases if you feel upset. What do you think?

User: I think that's a good plan! I hope I can do it.

Consultant: I believe you can, Xiao Ke. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. How about we talk about how you felt after the next group activity when we meet again?

User: Yes! I’ll let you know how it went! 

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it. I also want you to remember that it’s okay to have feelings of anger and frustration; what matters is how we handle them. You’re making wonderful progress.

User: Thank you! I feel better just talking about this.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone on this path. Just keep focusing on expressing yourself and connecting positively with your classmates. 

User: I will! I can’t wait for the next session.

Consultant: Me too, Xiao Ke! I’m proud of you for being open today. Let’s keep building on these positive experiences. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm glad to see you today. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit better. I tried talking to my classmates more, sharing my interests. It was fun, but sometimes I still feel frustrated.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re trying to engage with your classmates! It sounds like you’re making progress by sharing what you enjoy. Can you tell me more about those feelings of frustration? When do you notice them?

User: I get frustrated when they don’t seem to understand or when they interrupt me. I just want to be part of the fun, but I don’t know how to handle it sometimes.

Consultant: It must be tough when you feel interrupted, especially after you are making an effort to connect. It’s normal to feel that way. What thoughts run through your mind when this happens?

User: I start thinking that they don’t want to listen to me or that I’m boring. It makes me want to give up talking.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’d feel that way. Those thoughts can be pretty discouraging. Let’s explore them a bit more. Do you think those thoughts are always true? What evidence do you have for or against them?

User: Well, sometimes they do listen, and we talk about things I like. But when they don’t, it feels like nobody cares.

Consultant: You mentioned that sometimes they listen, which shows that they are interested at times. It might help to focus on those moments. What could you tell yourself when you start to feel like nobody cares?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s not always true. They might just be busy or not understand what I’m saying.

Consultant: That’s a really good perspective! Reframing those thoughts can help you feel less frustrated. Let’s practice that. If a classmate interrupts you, what phrase might you say to yourself to stay calm?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay, I can share my thoughts later.” That sounds better.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a positive and constructive thought. Now, let’s think about some situations. Can you recall a specific time when you felt frustrated? Let’s role-play it and see how you might react differently.

User: Sure! There was this time when I was talking about my favorite video game, and a friend kept cutting me off.

Consultant: Let’s act that out. You start sharing about your game, and I’ll interrupt you as your friend. See how you might feel and respond.

User: Okay. "So, my favorite game is…"

Consultant (interrupting): "Oh, I love that game, but have you tried this other one?"

User: Uh, I’d probably feel annoyed. But I could say, “I’d love to tell you more about this game first if that’s okay.”

Consultant: That’s a great way to express your feelings and assert yourself kindly. How do you feel after trying that response?

User: It feels better. I can still share without getting too upset.

Consultant: Excellent! This shows you can express your feelings and thoughts positively. Let’s summarize what we’ve practiced today. What do you feel you’ve learned?

User: I learned that I can change how I think when things get frustrating. I can remind myself that sometimes they just don’t understand.

Consultant: Yes! And you’ve built a strategy to communicate better. How will you use this in your conversations going forward?

User: I’ll try to be patient and remember what I can say to keep it positive.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It's important to keep that mindset. Next time we meet, we can discuss how these strategies worked for you and continue to build on your progress. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m excited to see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to hearing all about it, Xiao Ke. Remember, it’s all part of learning. If you feel any frustration, just practice your new thoughts! Goodbye for now, and take care!

User: Goodbye! Thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like there have been some positive changes in your behavior lately. How are you feeling about those improvements?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better. During the family gathering, I was able to interact well with everyone. It was nice, and my parents seemed proud of me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It must have felt rewarding to connect positively with your family. What do you think contributed to this positive change in your interactions?

User: I think I've been trying harder to control my emotions and not react too quickly. I also wanted to make my parents happy.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiao Ke. Wanting to please your parents can be a powerful motivator. Can you tell me more about how you managed your emotions during the gathering?

User: Well, when I felt angry or frustrated, I took a deep breath and counted to ten. It helped me to calm down before reacting.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Breathing and counting can really help in those moments. How did you feel after using this technique?

User: I felt more in control and less overwhelmed. It was nice to talk and play games without getting into arguments.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really building confidence in managing your emotions. Now that you've seen these improvements, how do you feel about your relationships with your classmates and teachers at school?

User: I’m still a bit worried. Sometimes I feel like I might lose control again when I get upset at school, especially when people tease me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have worries about that. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. Can you share a specific situation at school where you felt the teasing affected you?

User: There was a time in class when some kids laughed at me for not understanding the math problem. I got really frustrated and wanted to yell at them.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiao Ke. It’s understandable to feel upset when others are not being nice. If you could go back to that moment, what do you think you could do differently now using the skills you've developed?

User: I think I could remind myself to stay calm like I did at the family gathering. Maybe just ask the teacher for help instead of reacting.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Asking for help can also show your strength. Would you like to discuss some additional ways to handle teasing in the future?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! We can look at a few different strategies, such as finding a friend to talk to when you feel upset, or using humor to deflect the teasing. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I’ve tried to joke around sometimes, but it’s hard.

Consultant: Humor can indeed be tricky. Would it help if we brainstorm some light-hearted responses together that you could use when teasing happens?

User: Yeah, that could be fun.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s think of some responses. For example, if someone teases you about a mistake, you could say something funny like, "Well, everyone makes mistakes! Mine just have better hair!" How does that sound?

User: That’s funny! I like that one!

Consultant: I’m glad you like it! Using humor can lighten the mood and help you feel calmer. What about practicing a few more so you feel prepared for when it happens again?

User: Yes, I want to practice more.

Consultant: Perfect! Here's another one: if they tease you about being small, you could say, "Good things come in small packages!" What do you think about that response?

User: That’s great too! It makes me feel better about myself.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! Building positive self-talk is important. Now, let’s revisit how you feel about your emotional control. Do you think the techniques we've discussed will help you feel more confident?

User: Yes, I do. I think I can handle things better now.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! It's about building on the progress you’ve made and recognizing your strength. As we close our session today, what is the one thing you feel proud of?

User: I’m proud that I managed my anger at the family gathering and got to have fun with everyone.

Consultant: That’s an amazing pride to have, Xiao Ke! Remember, you have the ability to manage your emotions, and I believe you can apply what you’ve learned in school too. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. Thank you for sharing today, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now.
