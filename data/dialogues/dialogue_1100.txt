Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Can you start by sharing how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your interactions with your new classmates?

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling pretty anxious. Ever since I moved to this new school, I find it hard to connect with my classmates. I feel like I don't fit in, and I'm constantly worried about what they think of me.

Consultant: I appreciate your openness in sharing that. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and fear when it comes to social situations. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like you don't fit in?

User: I think it’s because everyone seems to know each other already, and I feel like an outsider. When I try to talk to them, I get really nervous and start worrying that I'm saying the wrong thing or that they'll judge me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling like an outsider can be very isolating. When you say you worry about saying the wrong thing, what kind of thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I often think they will laugh at me or that they'll think I'm weird. I constantly replay my conversations in my head afterwards, worrying about how I sounded.

Consultant: It sounds like those automatic thoughts are really reinforcing your anxiety. Let’s explore those thoughts more closely. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that they would laugh at you or think you're weird?

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence. I mean, they haven't actually laughed at me, but I just can't shake the feeling that they might.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're anxious. However, it's important to recognize that these thoughts might not reflect reality. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it's normal to feel nervous and that people usually don't judge others as harshly as we think they do.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have some insight into how to reframe those thoughts. Let's work on creating some alternative thoughts that could help you feel more at ease. For example, what if you thought, “I’m getting to know them, and they’re probably just as nervous as I am”?

User: That makes sense. I can see how that could help me feel a bit more relaxed. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, what small steps do you think you could take to practice this new way of thinking in social situations?

User: Maybe I could try to engage in small talks, like asking someone where they’re from or what they think about a class. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Small conversations can be a good way to ease into interactions. Remember that it’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. Let’s plan to discuss how those conversations go in our next session. How do you feel about giving it a try?

User: I think I can try that. I still feel scared, but it helps to have a plan.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, and having a plan can indeed provide some comfort. As we work on this together, remember to take it one step at a time. How would you feel about writing down your thoughts or feelings after each interaction? 

User: That could be helpful. I can see how reflecting on my feelings might help me understand them better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Noticing your feelings and documenting them will allow you to see patterns and insights over time. As you go through this process, try to be kind to yourself. Setbacks are part of progress!

User: Thank you, I’ll keep that in mind. Sometimes I feel like I just should be better at this already.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way, but remember that growth takes time and practice. You’re already doing important work by addressing your fears. It’s a process, and you're taking steps forward.

User: That helps; I feel a little bit more encouraged now. I guess I just need to be patient with myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, patience is key. As we continue our sessions, we're here to explore your thoughts and feelings, and you're not alone in this. How about we summarize what you want to focus on for next time?

User: I want to work on those small talks and pay attention to my feelings afterwards. I really want to understand my thoughts better and see if they change.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful focus for our next session! We’ll explore your experiences and any new insights you gain. For now, remember that you’re actively working on improving your social interactions. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel good! I’m leaving with some strategies and a clearer understanding of what I can work on.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Zhenzhen! You've made some significant steps today. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, and you are capable of handling these situations. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here to support you, and if you need anything before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. Keep practicing those small interactions, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to join some activities at school, like group projects and clubs, but I still feel really anxious during those interactions. I worry that I’m not doing well, and it's really hard for me to relax.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you've been putting yourself out there, which is a positive step, but the anxiety is still making it tough for you. Could you share with me some specific thoughts or feelings that come up when you are in these social situations?

User: Well, I often think that others might judge me negatively or that I’ll say something embarrassing. I feel like I can’t express myself clearly, and that makes me want to avoid situations altogether.

Consultant: That feeling of being judged can be really overwhelming. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think that others will judge you, how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really nervous and self-conscious. I also feel a bit of shame, like I should know how to handle these situations better.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you are trying to connect with others. Do you notice any patterns in your thinking during these moments? For example, do you sometimes think in black-and-white terms about how you are perceived?

User: Yes, I think that if I don’t perform perfectly, it means I’ve failed, and everyone will think I’m terrible. 

Consultant: That sounds like an extreme way of viewing the situation. Can we challenge that thought together? What evidence do you have that others would think you’re terrible if you make a mistake?

User: I don’t really have concrete evidence... It’s just this overwhelming feeling. It’s like my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario without thinking logically.

Consultant: That’s actually a common cognitive distortion called "catastrophizing." Let’s try to reframe that thought. Instead of thinking, "If I make a mistake, I’ll be seen as terrible," what might be a more balanced thought?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes, everyone does it, and it doesn’t define me completely.” 

Consultant: Exactly, that's a much more realistic perspective! Mistakes are a part of learning and growing. How can we remind you of this when you're facing those social situations?

User: I could write that thought down and remind myself of it before going into an interaction.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Having a reminder can help you shift your mindset. Now, let’s also think about some practical ways you can gradually increase your comfort level. What small steps could you take to ease into social situations this week?

User: I could try initiating small conversations with classmates, maybe during lunch or in group activities, just to practice.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Starting small can help reduce the pressure. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. How would you feel about practicing some of these conversations in our next session?

User: I think that would help! I’d be nervous, but I want to try. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel nervous. The important thing is that you're willing to take steps forward. We can also discuss some strategies to help you manage that anxiety when it arises. Would you like to explore some coping techniques together?

User: Yes, I’d love that. I want to feel more confident and less anxious in those moments.

Consultant: We can look into techniques like deep breathing or visualization to calm yourself. We’ll also create a support system for you, so you can have people to reach out to when you're feeling anxious. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good. I think having some strategies will help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation can make a huge difference. As we wrap up today, what is one takeaway you want to focus on until our next session?

User: I think I want to focus on my new thought about mistakes and practicing small conversations. 

Consultant: That's a solid focus, Zhenzhen! Remember, it’s okay to take things step by step. I'm proud of you for facing these challenges. We’ll build on these strategies in our next meeting. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Keep believing in yourself, and remember that it's a journey. I look forward to our next session to see how it goes!
###################
Consultant: Hi Zhenzhen! Welcome to today's session. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel quite anxious when I have to speak in front of my classmates. I did the presentation, but I was really unhappy with how I performed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still grappling with that feeling of dissatisfaction about your performance. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel unhappy with your presentation?

User: I stumbled over my words a lot, and I felt like everyone was judging me. I really wanted to convey my points clearly, but I kept thinking about how I was messing up.

Consultant: I can see how that experience would leave you feeling self-conscious. It’s common to worry about how others perceive us in situations like that. What thoughts were going through your mind during the presentation?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself and that my classmates would think I wasn’t good enough to be their spokesperson.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem really intense and would definitely contribute to your anxiety. It might help to explore how realistic those thoughts are. What evidence do you have that your classmates were judging you negatively?

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence. I guess I just felt so anxious that I assumed they weren’t impressed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to jump to conclusions when we’re anxious. Let's try to challenge that thought a bit. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to reassure them?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay, and that the important thing is that they tried their best.

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate perspective! It shows you have the ability to think kindly about others’ efforts. How can you apply that same kindness to yourself when you feel anxious about speaking?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m learning. It’s just hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: It can definitely be tough, especially in the moment of anxiety. One technique we could use is to develop a mantra or phrase you can repeat to yourself during presentations. Would you be willing to try creating one?

User: Yes, I think that might help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s think of a positive, affirming statement that counters your negative thoughts. How about something like, “I am prepared, and it’s okay to be imperfect”?

User: That sounds good. I like the idea of focusing on being prepared instead of worrying about being perfect.

Consultant: Excellent! Repeating that to yourself before and during presentations might help ground you. Now, shifting gears, let’s discuss some specific skills we can practice together to help you feel more confident in future presentations. Are you open to some role-playing exercises?

User: Yes, I think practicing might help me feel less anxious when I have to speak.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s simulate a short presentation about a topic you like. This will help you practice while in a safe environment. How does that sound?

User: That sounds a bit intimidating, but I want to try. I could present about my favorite book!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful choice! What book are you thinking of, and what key points do you want to cover?

User: I want to talk about the plot, the main character, and why I love it.

Consultant: That’s a solid outline! For this practice, let’s start with a brief introduction. I’ll give feedback along the way, and we’ll focus on making it feel less intimidating. Whenever you’re ready, go ahead!

User: Okay... um, hi everyone! Today I want to tell you about my favorite book, "Harry Potter." It follows a boy named Harry who discovers he’s a wizard...

Consultant: Great start, Zhenzhen! I love how you launched right into it. As you continue, try to make eye contact with different spots in the room, as it can help you feel more connected and engaged. 

User: Yeah, I felt a bit nervous about looking at anyone. 

Consultant: That’s common, but making small amounts of eye contact can help. Let’s keep practicing this, gradually extending the time you look at someone. How are you feeling so far?

User: I still feel a bit nervous, but it’s better that we’re practicing like this.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It’s normal to feel nervous, but you’re taking positive steps to manage it. Now, let’s continue with your presentation practice. What comes next?

User: The main character, Harry, learns to face his fears throughout the series, which I think is really inspiring...

Consultant: That’s a powerful perspective to share! It also invites your audience to think about their own fears. How can you wrap up your presentation with a strong closing?

User: I could say something like... “Harry’s journey teaches us that facing challenges can help us grow.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent conclusion! It connects everything beautifully. Remember, the more you practice, the more natural it will feel. After doing this, what do you think you can take away for your next actual presentation?

User: I think I’ll remember my mantra and practice making eye contact more. 

Consultant: Absolutely, those will be strong strategies! As we start wrapping up today, let’s reflect on your progress. How do you feel about the steps we've taken in this session?

User: I feel more hopeful. Practicing with you made it seem less scary, and I feel like I'm understanding my fears more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Acknowledging those feelings is a significant part of the journey. As we move forward, remember that practice and self-kindness are key. What will you focus on next as we continue our work together?

User: I want to keep practicing my speaking skills and challenging my negative thoughts about public speaking.

Consultant: I’m excited for you to continue this journey! You’re gaining valuable skills, and I believe you’ll feel more and more comfortable with time. When we meet again, we can build on these skills even further. Remember, I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhenzhen! Looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, actually. I’ve started talking more with my male classmates, and they seem friendly. It’s nice not to feel so judged.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you are gradually overcoming your fear of interacting with them. What specific experiences have made you feel more comfortable?

User: Well, I’ve had some casual conversations, and they were pretty easy-going. I realized they don’t seem critical at all, which surprised me.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It seems like you're beginning to see that not everyone is judgmental. How did these interactions make you feel about yourself?

User: I felt relieved and a little proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone. I want to keep this up.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling proud! This shift in perspective is really important. Can you think of any specific thoughts that went through your mind during those conversations?

User: I usually thought they would think I was awkward or silly, but instead, I found myself just enjoying the chat without those critical thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! You’ve replaced some negative thoughts with a more enjoyable experience. Let’s build on that. What do you think would help you maintain this positive interaction style moving forward?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that it’s okay to be myself and that they’re probably just as nervous. That might make it easier to talk.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that everyone has their own insecurities can really help. Let's try a role-play exercise. How would you introduce yourself to someone new?

User: I think I would say something simple like, "Hi! I’m Zhenzhen. How’s your day going?"

Consultant: That sounds perfect—simple and friendly. Let’s practice how you could respond if they ask you a question. Can you give it a try?

User: Sure! If someone said, "What do you like to do for fun?", I could say, "I enjoy reading and watching movies. How about you?"

Consultant: Excellent response! It keeps the conversation flowing and shows interest in them as well. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more confident. It’s nice to have a casual conversation starter.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Confidence will make a huge difference. If you ever feel anxious about starting a conversation, remember how it felt when you had those friendly chats and the positive outcomes.

User: Right, I will keep that in mind. I just need to remind myself not to overthink it.

Consultant: Exactly! Overthinking can create unnecessary pressure. You’ve mentioned enjoying the conversation recently, which is key. Let's explore how you can create more opportunities for that.

User: I could try joining some group activities at school where I can meet more people.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Group activities are a perfect way to engage without the pressure of one-on-one conversations. What kind of activities interest you?

User: I’m thinking about joining a club or participating in group projects. That could be fun!

Consultant: That sounds perfect! These settings provide natural opportunities for interaction. How do you think participating in these activities might help you further?

User: I think it might help me relax and not focus too much on individual interactions. Plus, I’d be part of a group, which feels safer.

Consultant: That’s a solid perspective. Enjoying the collective experience can lessen the anxiety of individual conversations. Let’s set a small goal for this week regarding participation.

User: Maybe I can join a club meeting and introduce myself to at least one new person.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It’s achievable and puts you in a friendly environment. How likely do you feel about accomplishing that?

User: I feel pretty motivated! I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, every small step counts. When we meet next time, we can discuss how that went and reflect on your feelings afterwards.

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to sharing my experience!

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it too, Zhenzhen! You’re doing great work in changing how you interact with others. Keep that positive outlook, and we can build on it together.

User: Thank you! I feel much more optimistic about this now.

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, these interactions are all part of learning and growing. I’m confident that you’ll enhance your confidence and enjoyment in social settings.

User: I really appreciate your support. I’ll practice what we talked about!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This progress is exciting, and I can’t wait to see how things unfold. Take care and good luck with your goal!

User: Thanks! See you next time.

Consultant: See you next time, Zhenzhen!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhenzhen! I'm really glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot better. I participated in the class gathering and even performed, which surprisingly received positive feedback from my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you've started to enjoy participating in group activities. How did it feel for you to perform in front of others?

User: It was nerve-wracking at first, but once I got into it, I felt excited and happy. The applause and compliments from my friends made me feel really good about myself.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It seems like you gained a lot of confidence from that experience. How do you think this will affect your willingness to take part in similar activities in the future?

User: I think it will encourage me to participate more often. I used to feel so anxious about being in the spotlight, but now I'm starting to see it as a fun opportunity instead of something scary.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in perspective! Recognizing these opportunities as enjoyable can really change how you approach social situations. Are there any specific activities you’re considering joining or trying out next?

User: Well, there’s a school talent show coming up, and I'm thinking about trying out for it. I want to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone again.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Challenging yourself can lead to even more growth. What aspects of participating in the talent show excite you the most?

User: I guess I like the idea of showcasing my talent, but I'm also excited about meeting new people and making more friends through this experience.

Consultant: Connecting with others through shared interests is a wonderful way to build relationships. What steps can you take to prepare for the talent show and make the most of this experience?

User: I think I need to practice my act a lot more and maybe invite a few friends to help me rehearse. That way, I won’t feel so alone in this.

Consultant: Involving friends in your preparation sounds like a fantastic plan! Not only will they support you, but it can also make the process more enjoyable. Have you talked to any friends yet about your plan?

User: Not yet, but I think I’ll bring it up tomorrow! I feel a bit nervous about asking, but I hope they will be supportive.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about reaching out, but remember, your friends likely want to support you. Think about how you felt receiving positive feedback after your performance—your friends may feel equally positive about helping you! 

User: That's true. Last time, their encouragement really helped me feel better. I guess I should focus on that!

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the support can help ease some of that nervousness. As you think about asking them for help, how do you want to frame the conversation?

User: I think I'll just be open and honest about wanting to practice together. Maybe let them know how much I appreciated their support last time.

Consultant: That sounds great, Zhenzhen! Being open about your feelings can foster understanding and connection among friends. How do you think you will feel once you’ve had that conversation with them?

User: I hope to feel relieved and supported. I really want to carry on building this confidence!

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset to have. Building on your experiences with support from friends can definitely strengthen your confidence. What will be your plan for practicing, once you have their support?

User: I want to create a schedule with them to practice at least twice a week leading up to the show. We can keep each other motivated!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Having a schedule and holding each other accountable will keep you focused and engaged. How do you think you’ll manage any anxiety that comes up while preparing?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the fun I had last time and that it’s just a way to express myself, rather than worrying too much about how perfect I need to be.

Consultant: That’s a strong strategy. Focusing on the joy of self-expression can help alleviate that pressure. How do you feel about using this same mindset in other social situations outside of performances?

User: I think it might really help! If I can remind myself to enjoy the moment and not stress about the outcome, I could be more relaxed in other activities, too.

Consultant: Exactly! Applying this mindset across different situations can foster more joy in your interactions. In our next session, we can discuss your experiences with both the talent show and any other activities you pursue. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to updating you on how it goes.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it too! You've made wonderful progress, Zhenzhen. Keep embracing these opportunities, and remember, you have the support of your friends. See you next time! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Zhenzhen! I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. Being the coordinator for the student activities group has really boosted my confidence. I enjoy leading and participating more than I expected.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like stepping into that role has helped you feel more capable and engaged. Can you tell me more about how it has changed your interactions with others?

User: Well, I used to be really shy, but now I find it easier to talk to my classmates. I think they respect me more because of my role, and that feels really nice.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a positive shift in your social interactions, which is fantastic! What specific moments have made you feel particularly proud or accomplished in this role?

User: Just last week, we organized a small event, and it went really well. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and I received compliments from both my peers and teachers.

Consultant: That must have been a fulfilling experience! It’s great to see that your efforts are being recognized. How do you plan to build on this newfound confidence in other areas of your life?

User: I think I’d like to take on more responsibilities in school and even try to be more active in class discussions. I want to push myself a bit more.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Engaging more in class and taking on responsibilities can definitely help reinforce your confidence. Are there any specific challenges you foresee in making those changes?

User: Sometimes I still get nervous speaking up in front of everyone. I worry people might judge me or think my ideas aren’t good enough.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about sharing your thoughts. Let’s take a moment to explore those feelings. What do you think might be the worst outcome if you voiced your ideas in class?

User: I guess the worst would be if nobody agrees with me or if I make a mistake. That makes me hesitate.

Consultant: Understandable. Let’s reflect on this—how often do you think others in your class have made mistakes, yet it didn’t affect how people view them?

User: True, I see people trying and sometimes failing, but they still get support from others. I guess it's part of learning.

Consultant: Precisely! Mistakes are an essential part of growth. If you were to view your contributions as opportunities for learning rather than chances for judgment, how might that change your outlook?

User: I think it would help me feel less pressured. If I focus on the process of sharing rather than the outcome, I might feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your mindset can empower you to express yourself more freely. What strategies can we create together to help you practice this in class?

User: Maybe I could start by setting small goals, like sharing at least one thought in each lesson. That sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Focusing on small, achievable goals can really help you build confidence. How will you hold yourself accountable to follow through on this strategy?

User: I'm thinking I could ask a friend to keep an eye on me and encourage me to share more during discussions.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Having a supportive friend can make a big difference. How do you feel about discussing ways to overcome any nervousness you might experience while speaking up?

User: I think that would be helpful! Sometimes I forget to breathe when I'm anxious.

Consultant: Acknowledging that can be quite powerful. Simple breathing techniques can help calm your nerves. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, I’d love that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this together: take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice and calming. I can see how this could help when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s the idea! Regularly practicing this can help you cultivate a sense of calm. How do you plan to incorporate this into your routine?

User: I think I’ll try to take a moment to breathe before speaking in class. That should help me relax.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, building new habits takes time. We’ve talked a lot about your progress and the strategies you can implement going forward. How do you feel about the growth you’ve made overall?

User: I feel really proud of myself and more confident than before. I’m excited about trying these new strategies!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhenzhen! Your progress is commendable. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you want to move forward. What will be your key takeaways from this session?

User: I think the key points are to keep pushing myself to participate, use breathing techniques to manage anxiety, and lean on my friends for support.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! Before we conclude our sessions, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No questions, just a big thank you! I feel ready to take on new challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so proud of your progress, and I believe you’re equipped to manage your emotions and experiences. If you ever need support again, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck, Zhenzhen!
