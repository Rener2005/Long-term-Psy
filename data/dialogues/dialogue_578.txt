Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're here today. I want to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling recently. You mentioned some complex emotions. Can you share more about that?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really restless and desperate because of everything going on. I keep thinking about my late girlfriend, especially since I’ve met someone new at the research institute. It's all just so confusing.

Consultant: I can sense that you're feeling a lot of conflicting emotions right now — the memory of your past relationship intertwining with the new person in your life. How does this emotional turmoil affect your daily routine and your work on your thesis?

User: It's really affecting my focus. I sit down to work, but my mind just drifts back to the past, and I can't concentrate. It's so frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds overwhelming, Liu. It seems like your mind is pulling you between the past and the present, making it hard to stay grounded. When you find yourself drifting back to those memories, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think about how happy I was then and how much I've lost. Sometimes I even feel guilty for having feelings for someone else now.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel guilt, especially when you're reminded of a significant loss. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What do you think it means about you to feel guilty for having feelings for someone new?

User: I guess I feel like it's disloyal to my late girlfriend. Like I'm supposed to only be mourning her and not allow myself to move on.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, feeling like you need to remain loyal to someone who is no longer here. It might help to question that belief. Is there any evidence that loving someone again means you're being disloyal to your past?

User: I’ve never thought of it that way. I just feel so tied to her memory, like if I move on, it’s like I’m forgetting her.

Consultant: That's a profound realization. Remembering her does not mean you cannot find happiness in a new relationship. If you were to share this with a friend in a similar situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I’d tell them it’s okay to feel happy again and that loving someone new doesn’t erase the love they had before.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! If we apply that same kindness to yourself, how might that change your view of your feelings for this new person?

User: It might help me accept those feelings instead of pushing them away. I just want to find a way to feel a little more at peace.

Consultant: Finding peace is a worthy goal. Let’s think about how you can create a space in your mind for both your memories and your current emotions. Have you considered activities that help you express or process your feelings?

User: I used to enjoy writing but haven't done it in a while. Maybe that could help.

Consultant: Writing can be a powerful tool for processing feelings and gaining clarity. How about setting aside some time this week to write about these emotions? You could express your memories and how you feel about the new person as well.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Great! It will serve as a safe space for your thoughts. After you’ve written, I’d love to hear how it makes you feel. Also, what else can we explore today that might help you navigate these feelings?

User: I think it would help to talk more about what I want moving forward. I'm feeling stuck.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s discuss that. What kind of things do you want to feel or achieve as you move forward?

User: I want to feel more open to new experiences and not be held back by the past. I want to enjoy life again.

Consultant: That’s a positive direction to aim for! Let’s identify some small steps you can take to open yourself up to new experiences. What are some activities or contexts where you feel you could explore joy or connection?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or engage more with friends. It might distract me and help me connect with others.

Consultant: Engaging with others sounds like a wonderful way to create new memories. How can you make that happen in the next few days?

User: I could reach out to classmates. That might help me feel less isolated.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Taking that step to connect can really uplift your spirit. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your main takeaways. How do you feel looking ahead after today’s conversation?

User: I feel a little lighter, honestly. I have a direction to work toward, and maybe writing will help me sort through everything.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, processing complex emotions takes time, but you're already on the right path. Let’s check in again soon to see how you’re feeling and what progress you’ve made. If you need guidance or support, I’m here for you.

User: Thanks, I appreciate it. I look forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been quite unsettled. I keep thinking about that female classmate and how close she seems with another guy. It gets me all worked up, and I really don't know how to handle these feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts and feelings are quite distressing for you. Can you tell me more about what’s been going through your mind when you see them together?

User: I guess I feel jealous and frustrated. It makes me question if I even stand a chance with her. I just feel stuck.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Jealousy can stir up a lot of confusion and hurt. Let’s explore what specifically makes you feel stuck. What thoughts come up for you when you experience these feelings?

User: I often think that I must not be good enough for her since she seems so happy with someone else. It’s like a constant reminder of my insecurities.

Consultant: It seems like you’re really being hard on yourself, believing you’re not good enough. Can you identify any evidence that might contradict that thought? What qualities do you have that you value?

User: Well, I like to think I’m a good person, kind of funny, and I’m quite dedicated to my studies. But in moments like this, those qualities just fade away.

Consultant: Those are admirable qualities, Liu. It’s easy to lose sight of our strengths when we're feeling vulnerable. Have you ever noticed if this insecurity affects other areas of your life or interactions?

User: Yes, definitely. I find it hard to focus on my thesis, and I think I’m becoming less social. It feels like all I do is dwell on this situation.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. When we focus too much on our worries, it can consume our energy. What would it look like for you to redirect some of that time or energy into something enjoyable or productive?

User: I used to enjoy going out with friends or working on projects outside of school. I guess I could try to make time for those things again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! What kind of activities do you think would help bring back some joy or fulfillment into your life?

User: Maybe I could start going back to the gym or pick up a hobby like drawing again. I used to find a lot of peace in that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging in hobbies can be incredibly restorative. How do you think starting these activities could help with your current feelings about your classmate and your studies?

User: I think it might help shift my focus away from those negative feelings and give me something positive to look forward to. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about creating an environment that fosters positivity and confidence. Let’s think about how you can plan to incorporate these activities into your week. 

User: I can try to set aside specific times for drawing and going to the gym. Maybe three times a week for each?

Consultant: That sounds very achievable. Setting times can create accountability. How do you feel about committing to this plan?

User: I feel like it’ll be good for me. I just hope I don’t get too caught up in my thoughts again.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, but remember, the goal is to acknowledge those thoughts without letting them take control. We can always revisit strategies to handle intrusive thoughts if they arise.

User: That makes sense. I appreciate having that reminder. It really helps to talk about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As you continue these activities, try to pay attention to any shifts in your mood or focus. What might be a helpful way to check in with yourself?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal about how I feel after each session of drawing or gym workouts. I think that might help me reflect.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. When do you think you’ll get started with this plan?

User: I can start tomorrow. I have some free time, and it’ll be a good distraction from all these worries.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about revisiting these feelings again in our next session?

User: I think that’s important. I want to see if I can make these changes and how they impact my feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! It will be beneficial to monitor those changes together. We can also discuss any new thoughts or feelings that arise as you focus on other aspects of your life.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu. Remember that you have the strength to navigate these feelings. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

User: Me too! I feel ready to try, and I'm less anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Stay kind to yourself as you explore these new activities. I'll see you next time!

User: See you then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite down lately. The pressure of finishing my thesis combined with my feelings for someone I like is just overwhelming. I can't seem to focus.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anxiety from your thesis work and disappointment in your emotional situation. Let's explore these feelings a bit more. What specifically makes you feel overwhelmed right now?

User: I keep worrying that I won't finish my thesis on time, and at the same time, I feel like I'm drifting away from the person I care about. It's like I can't manage both my academic life and my emotions.

Consultant: That's understandable. Balancing academic pressures and personal feelings can be really challenging. What do you think would help you feel more in control over both aspects?

User: I guess I would like to feel more focused and organized with my thesis, and maybe find ways to connect better with that person. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach. Let's break it down then. If you could prioritize one area first—your thesis or your emotional connection—what would it be?

User: I think I should focus on my thesis first, as it's due soon anyway. But the emotional aspect is really weighing on me.

Consultant: That makes sense. If we can improve your focus on your thesis, it might also help alleviate some of your emotional stress. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you work on your thesis?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough and that I might fail. These thoughts make it hard for me to sit down and write.

Consultant: It sounds like those negative thoughts are quite powerful for you. Let's try to challenge them together. How true do you think those thoughts are? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: Well, I've done well in my classes, and I've worked hard. But when I'm writing, those thoughts just take over.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight. So, it seems there’s evidence in your past successes that contradicts that fear of failure. What if you reframed that thought into something more balanced? For example, instead of "I'm not good enough," you could say, "I've done well before, and I can tackle this too." How does that feel to you?

User: That does sound a bit better. I guess I just need to remind myself of those past successes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building on previous successes can help you regain some confidence. Now, let’s focus on setting a small, achievable goal for your thesis. What’s one step you can take this week that would help you make progress?

User: Maybe I can aim to write a certain number of pages each day, like two pages. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Writing two pages a day is a concrete and achievable goal. Let's also think about connecting with the person you care about. What's one small step you could take there?

User: I could message them and see if they want to grab coffee. It might help to talk things through.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Reaching out may help you feel more connected and could positively affect your mood. How would you feel about taking that step after our session today?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think it would be good to try. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous. But remember, taking small actions can lead to positive changes, both academically and emotionally. After you send that message, how could you celebrate that achievement, no matter the outcome?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a good meal or some time playing video games.

Consultant: That’s a lovely way to reward yourself! Focusing on self-care is just as important as the tasks at hand. How do you feel about our discussions today? 

User: I feel clearer about what I need to do, which is comforting. Talking through my plans helps a lot. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're making meaningful steps toward managing both your thesis and emotional connections. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these challenges. How about we check in next week to see how you’re progressing with these goals?

User: Sure, that sounds good. I'm looking forward to updating you on my progress, and hopefully, I’ll feel even better.

Consultant: That's the spirit! I’m looking forward to hearing about your achievements. Remember, each small step counts. Take care, and see you next week!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. Before we start, how have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been doing a bit better actually. Participating in that school club activity helped me take my mind off some emotional struggles. I felt lighter and enjoyed interacting with others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in social activities can really provide a sense of relief and connection. Can you tell me more about your experience in the club? What did you enjoy the most?

User: I really enjoyed the teamwork and camaraderie. It felt good to be part of a group with a common goal. It was something I needed after feeling a bit isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like the sense of belonging was really fulfilling for you. How has this experience influenced your daily feelings or interactions outside of the club?

User: I’ve felt more motivated lately and even reached out to some friends I hadn’t spoken to in a while. It’s nice to feel connected again.

Consultant: That's a significant step! Reaching out to friends can enrich your relationships and improve your emotional state. What do you think has changed in your mindset that made you feel more inclined to connect with others?

User: I guess being in a group made me realize how much I missed social interactions. I've also been trying to focus on the positives rather than dwelling on negative feelings.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing the positives can greatly impact how we feel. How do you feel about the changes you've noticed in yourself regarding your emotional resilience?

User: I feel more empowered. I didn't expect to enjoy being around people so much, and it gives me hope that I can get through tougher times by staying engaged.

Consultant: It's excellent that you're finding empowerment in these experiences. It shows that you can draw strength from social support. Have you thought about ways to maintain these connections or continue engaging with others?

User: Yes, I’m thinking of joining more activities. I want to keep finding ways to meet new people and have fun.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Engaging in new activities can help you broaden your social circle. What kinds of activities are you interested in exploring next?

User: I’m open to trying different things, maybe a sports club or some community service events. Just anything that gets me out and involved.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Both sports and community service can be great ways to connect with others while contributing to your community. How do you think participating in these activities could affect your overall mood?

User: I believe it would keep my spirits high. Being active and doing something good always lifts me up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping active and contributing positively can significantly enhance your well-being. Are there any specific goals you’d like to set for participating in these activities?

User: I think my goal is to participate in at least one activity each week. It would help me stay connected and also make a new routine for myself.

Consultant: Setting a weekly goal is a great strategy. It will help create consistency in your efforts to connect with others. How will you hold yourself accountable for this goal?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I write down what activities I did and reflect on how I felt after. This way, I can track my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive approach! Journaling can help you gain insights into your experiences and emotions. How do you feel about the idea of reflecting on your interactions?

User: I think it would be beneficial. I often overlook my feelings after socializing, and writing them down could help me process everything better.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflection can provide clarity and reinforce positive feelings. As you embark on this journey, what else do you think might support you in maintaining your emotional balance?

User: I guess continuing to practice positive thinking would help. I don’t want to fall back into negative thought patterns.

Consultant: That's an important point. Being aware of those patterns and actively working against them can consolidate your progress. Have you considered any specific positive affirmations or thoughts to focus on?

User: I could remind myself that I’m capable of overcoming difficulties and that social connections are beneficial. It might help ground me in anxious moments.

Consultant: Those affirmations sound powerful! Reminding yourself of your capabilities can help in moments of doubt. As we conclude today's session, what are the key takeaways you would like to focus on as you move forward?

User: I want to focus on staying active socially, keeping a journal, and practicing positive thinking. These all seem manageable and effective for me.

Consultant: Those are excellent focus areas! You've made significant progress today, and I believe you’re well on your way to maintaining a fulfilling social life. Remember, it’s all about balance and finding what works for you. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel much more motivated now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've got this, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm really glad you're here today. Last time we talked about how you've been exploring new hobbies like photography. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good. Engaging in photography has given me a sense of fulfillment. I’m really enjoying capturing moments, and it feels like I've got something meaningful to focus on.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like photography is really enriching your life. Can you share a bit more about what you enjoy most about this new hobby?

User: I love the creativity involved. When I'm out taking photos, I feel like I can express myself in a unique way. It gives me a break from my regular academic pressures, which is a relief.

Consultant: It’s great that photography allows you to express yourself creatively while also providing a break from your studies. Have you thought about setting specific goals related to your photography to help deepen your engagement with it?

User: Yes, I’ve been thinking about that. I want to improve my skills and maybe even start a little project, like creating a photo album or something. But sometimes I hesitate because I worry I won’t do it well.

Consultant: Those are great aspirations! It's natural to feel hesitant about starting a project, especially when you set high expectations for yourself. Can we explore where those worries come from? What thoughts cross your mind when you think about not doing it well?

User: I guess I fear that my photos won't be good enough, and I’ll feel embarrassed to share them. It makes me think I should wait until I have more experience before trying something like that.

Consultant: It’s common to have such fears, especially when trying something new. But it might help to challenge that thought. What if we looked at it from a different perspective? Could it be possible to value your progress and creativity more than the outcome itself?

User: That makes sense. I’ve realized that I enjoy the process of taking photos more than focusing on how they turn out. Maybe I should allow myself to explore without putting too much pressure on the result.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the joy of the process rather than the end result can make a big difference. How about we set a small goal for you? Maybe you could aim to take a certain number of photos each week without worrying about their quality.

User: I like that idea. Setting a goal like that would take some pressure off and help me stay engaged with my photography. I think I could aim for at least 20 photos per week.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Aiming for 20 photos a week will give you a structured way to enjoy your hobby. How do you feel about sharing the results with someone, even if it's just for yourself?

User: Sharing could be fun and maybe even motivating. I could share them with my sister or post them online, but I still feel a little vulnerable about it.

Consultant: Feeling vulnerable when sharing something personal is completely understandable. It can also be part of the growth process. What if each time you share, you focus on what you felt while creating those photos rather than just the pictures themselves?

User: That’s a good point! I can focus more on the experience and less on how others will judge it. It might make sharing feel more meaningful.

Consultant: Exactly! By focusing on the experience, you’re more likely to connect with others in a fulfilling way. When you share, you’re sharing a part of your journey. How does this approach resonate with you?

User: It feels much more comforting. I think it’ll make sharing less stressful since it’s more about my connection to the moment rather than trying to impress anyone.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you pursue this, remember to celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they might seem. How will you celebrate your achievements in photography moving forward?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to a nice coffee outing after completing my weekly goal. It sounds like a nice reward and a way to reflect on my week.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Treating yourself can reinforce positive habits. As you work on these goals, how do you feel your confidence in both photography and managing your emotions will grow?

User: I believe my confidence will improve as I keep at it. Engaging with photography and sharing my work will likely help me feel more accomplished overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each step you take will build your confidence and enhance your sense of control in life. As we discuss these changes, what have you learned about yourself through this process?

User: I’ve learned that I can enjoy new activities and grow, even if I feel uncertain at first. It’s encouraging to realize that I can take risks while still keeping my happiness in focus.

Consultant: That's an insightful realization! Embracing uncertainty while pursuing joy is a key part of personal growth. As we wrap up today, let’s think about how you can maintain your emotional well-being while continuing to nurture this hobby. What strategies do you think could help?

User: I think keeping a journal about my photography experiences might help. I can reflect on my feelings and progress regularly, which should help me stay positive.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Journaling can allow you to track your journey and reinforce those positive thoughts. As we conclude our session, remember the progress you’ve made and the tools you have to continue developing your passion for photography and managing your emotions.

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to take on my photography journey and maintain my emotional balance. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, you can always reach out if you need someone to talk to as you continue on this path. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like there's been some positive progress in your life recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel quite optimistic these days. My thesis is moving along well, and I’ve received positive feedback from my advisor. It feels great to have that support.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Positive feedback can really boost our confidence and motivation. Can you share more about how this support has impacted your emotional state or your daily life?

User: Definitely! I feel more confident in my writing and ability to manage my time. I’ve adjusted my routine to allocate more focused hours for my thesis, which has helped me feel more in control.

Consultant: It sounds like you've not only made progress on your thesis but have also found a routine that works for you. That sense of control is so important. What specific strategies or changes have you implemented in your routine?

User: I started setting daily goals for my writing and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts. I also make sure to take short breaks, which helps me stay fresh and focused.

Consultant: Great strategies! Breaking tasks into smaller parts can make them feel less overwhelming. How have you found balancing work and breaks? Do you think you’ve managed to strike a good balance?

User: Yes, I think so. I’ve been more mindful about taking breaks and not getting too caught up in my work. This has really helped my mood and overall productivity.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It sounds like you’ve developed a healthy working pattern. As we reflect on your journey, what would you say has been your biggest breakthrough in managing your emotions and maintaining this positive outlook?

User: I think my biggest breakthrough has been realizing that I can rely on my support system. Talking to my advisor and friends about my worries really helps alleviate the pressure.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! Having a support system can make a big difference in how we handle stress. Are there any specific moments when you reached out for support that stood out to you?

User: Yes, there was a moment when I felt overwhelmed with the thesis. I called my advisor to discuss my concerns, and he reassured me that I was on the right path. That really calmed me down.

Consultant: It’s so valuable to hear that reassurance from someone who understands the process. Moving forward, how do you plan to maintain this support and manage any potential stressors that might arise?

User: I plan to keep communicating with my advisor regularly and maybe set up weekly check-ins. I also want to stay in touch with friends to keep that support available.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Liu. Establishing regular check-ins can really help with accountability and support. What other strategies do you think you could use if you feel stress creeping in again?

User: I might try to employ mindfulness techniques or even some light exercise to refresh my mind. I’ve heard they can be really helpful for managing stress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Mindfulness and physical activity can be excellent tools for managing stress. Have you tried any mindfulness practices before, or would this be a new approach for you?

User: I haven't really tried it consistently, but I’ve done some meditation before. I think I could incorporate it more regularly into my routine.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Even just a few minutes a day can make a real difference. How do you feel about setting a small achievable goal for incorporating mindfulness into your routine?

User: I think I’ll aim for 5 to 10 minutes of meditation in the mornings. It seems manageable, and I’ll see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfectly achievable goal! Starting small will help you establish the routine without feeling overwhelmed. As we wrap up, what are your thoughts on the progress you’ve made so far in managing your emotions and maintaining positivity?

User: I feel really proud of what I’ve accomplished. I’ve learned a lot about myself and how to manage my stress, and it feels good to be aware of my triggers.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful reflection, Liu. Recognizing your progress and understanding your emotional triggers is a significant step in emotional regulation. How do you think you can celebrate this progress?

User: I might treat myself to a nice dinner or something afterwards. I think acknowledging my achievements is important.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Celebrating your achievements reinforces positive behavior and helps maintain motivation. Remember, it's essential to keep up the self-care and acknowledgment of your efforts. How are you feeling about everything as we conclude our session today?

User: I feel relieved and optimistic. I’m grateful for the progress I've made and the strategies we’ve discussed. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth and resilience. Remember to keep using your support system and the strategies we discussed. If you ever feel you need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I wish you continued success with your thesis!
