Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really glad you're here today. I understand things have been challenging for you lately. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I just feel really anxious about everything. Living in the shelter, I feel disappointed and helpless about my future. I’m really hoping to find a job to change my situation.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty about your future, especially considering your living situation. What kind of job are you looking for, and why do you think having a job would help you?

User: I guess I want a job that allows me to make some money and feel more independent. I believe it would make me feel better about myself and give me hope for the future.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Xiao Ming. Gaining independence and having financial stability can significantly impact how you feel about your life. Can you tell me a bit about what specific feelings come up when you think about finding a job?

User: I feel nervous and overwhelmed. What if I can't find anything? It just makes me anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about job hunting, especially when the future feels uncertain. Let's break this down a bit. When you think about not being able to find a job, what specific thoughts or beliefs cross your mind?

User: I often think, “I’m not good enough” or “No one will hire me.” It’s like I can't see any possibilities for myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, and it’s understandable that they would make you feel anxious. Let's explore those beliefs a little more. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts about not being good enough or not being hired?

User: I guess I just don’t have much experience. I see others around me with jobs, and it makes me feel like I won’t measure up.

Consultant: I can see how that’s distressing for you. It sounds like you may be comparing yourself to others, which can be tough. Have there been times when you felt capable or had accomplishments, even if they were small?

User: I did well in my last school project. My teacher praised me, but then I just feel like that doesn’t matter when I see others finding work.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement to recognize, Xiao Ming! It shows you have strengths and abilities. Let’s think about how you can use that confidence from your school project in your job search. What small steps do you think you could take toward finding a job?

User: Maybe I could start by updating my resume and applying for some volunteer positions. That could give me some experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Volunteering can provide you with valuable experience and help you build confidence. How do you feel about taking those steps?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It seems manageable when I break it down like that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about taking those manageable steps. What other feelings come up for you as you think about moving forward with this plan?

User: I still feel anxious, but it’s mixed with a bit of excitement. Like maybe I can change things for myself.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel both anxious and excited at the same time. That means you’re recognizing the potential for change. What strategies do you think could help you manage the anxiety you feel as you take these steps?

User: I could try some deep breathing when I start to feel anxious. I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic technique! It can help ground you and reduce anxiety. Let’s practice one together. Take a deep breath in for four seconds, hold for four, and then exhale slowly for four. How does that feel?

User: That actually helped a little. I felt my heart slow down.

Consultant: Wonderful! Practicing that when you feel anxious can be a helpful tool in your journey. As we move forward, what goals do you think you could set for yourself in the next week regarding your job search and anxiety management?

User: I want to revise my resume, look for volunteer opportunities, and practice deep breathing daily. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent, achievable goals! It seems like you’re starting to take charge of your situation, which is a significant step. How can you hold yourself accountable for these goals?

User: Maybe I can write them down and check in with myself every few days to see how I’m progressing.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing things down and regularly checking in will help keep you accountable. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’ll remember from our session?

User: I think realizing that I can take small steps to change my situation is really important. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Small steps can lead to significant change, and you have the strength to work toward your goals. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but you’re not alone in this journey. If you need support, I’m here to help. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm glad to see you here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my anxiety, but I'm still confused about what direction I want to take for my future. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that your anxiety has reduced a bit. Let’s dive deeper into your feelings about the future. Can you tell me what specifically makes you feel confused right now? 

User: Well, I participated in a club activity recently, and I really enjoyed it. But now I don’t know if I should focus on that interest or explore other options. 

Consultant: That sounds encouraging, finding something you enjoy! It’s also completely normal to feel unsure about whether to stick with one interest or broaden your horizons. How do you feel when you think about choosing a specific path versus exploring more options? 

User: I feel excited about the club, but I also worry that if I focus too much on it, I might miss out on other opportunities. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have a mix of curiosity and apprehension about committing to one path. What do you think are some of the opportunities you might miss if you focus solely on the club? 

User: Maybe I could miss discovering other talents or interests I might have. Like, I’ve never tried painting or coding. 

Consultant: Those do sound like interesting skills to explore! Let's think about how we can set some short-term goals for yourself. What if you tried allocating some time each week to explore painting or coding alongside your club activities? How does that sound to you? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could try painting on weekends. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start, Xiao Ming! Setting aside dedicated time can help you experience different activities without feeling overwhelmed. How many hours do you think you could realistically set aside for painting? 

User: Maybe just two hours on Saturdays. 

Consultant: Two hours on Saturdays seems very manageable! In the meantime, how do you think exploring painting will help you with your overall goals? 

User: I think it might give me a new perspective and maybe help me to express myself better. 

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Expressing yourself creatively can really help clarify your thoughts and feelings. Besides the painting, are there any other interests you have that you've been considering? 

User: I’ve thought about coding too, but I haven't really started anything yet. 

Consultant: Coding can open many doors for you! What if we set a goal for you to watch a tutorial or take a small online course over the next few weeks? Would that be something you’d be interested in? 

User: Yeah, I think I could do that! 

Consultant: Fantastic! You’re setting yourself up for potential growth. Let's summarize your goals: you want to explore painting for two hours on Saturdays and look into a coding tutorial in the next few weeks. Does that sound right? 

User: Yes, that’s correct! 

Consultant: Great job, Xiao Ming! Now, what steps can you take to ensure you'll stick to this plan? 

User: I could set reminders on my phone. 

Consultant: Setting reminders is an excellent strategy! It will keep these goals at the forefront of your mind. Let’s also think about how you would feel if you don’t stick to these goals. 

User: I guess I’d feel disappointed in myself for not trying. 

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is important. But remember, setbacks happen! If that happens, what strategy could you implement to bounce back and keep moving forward? 

User: I can always try again and not be too hard on myself. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset to have! Being kind to yourself during this process is vital. Looking ahead, how does the idea of pursuing these interests and goals make you feel about your future? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but still a little uncertain. 

Consultant: Feeling hopeful yet uncertain is understandable, especially when exploring new paths. What would it take for you to feel more certain about your choices? 

User: Maybe if I could see some progress or find something I really enjoy doing. 

Consultant: Progress can certainly help clarify your interests and ease uncertainty. As you begin to paint and explore coding, pay attention to how you feel about each experience. Do you think you could keep a journal to reflect on your experiences? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! Writing it down might help me see my thoughts more clearly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection. As we wrap up our session today, what are your biggest takeaways, and how do you feel about moving forward? 

User: I think I feel more confident now about trying new things. Setting those goals made me realize I can do it! 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, exploration is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You’ve made great progress today, and I believe you have the strengths to continue moving forward. If you ever feel lost again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Ming! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I’m really glad to see you here today. I understand you’ve been thinking about your career options lately. How about we start by discussing what sparked your interest in certain professions?

User: Hi! Yes, I recently participated in a career experience program at school. I discovered I enjoy creative fields, but I feel overwhelmed trying to pick one.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the program helped you explore creative fields. Feeling overwhelmed is completely normal when faced with choices. Can you share what specific careers you found interesting and what aspects appealed to you?

User: I liked graphic design and filmmaking, but I’m worried I might not be good enough to succeed in those areas.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some exciting interests! But it also seems you’re dealing with some self-doubt about your abilities. Let’s explore that a bit. What makes you feel you're not good enough for those careers?

User: I guess I’m just not sure if I have the right talent or if I can improve my skills enough to compete with others. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern, especially in creative fields, where there’s often a lot of competition. What evidence do you have that suggests you might not have the talent for these careers?

User: I haven’t really had much practice, and I sometimes see others’ work and feel it's way better than mine.

Consultant: It’s understandable to compare yourself to others, but it's important to remember that everyone starts somewhere. Have you considered how you might improve your skills with practice?

User: I’ve thought about taking some classes or online tutorials to develop my abilities, but I’m still not convinced it will help me.

Consultant: That’s a constructive idea! Taking classes can definitely help you gain more skills and confidence. Let’s challenge that thought—if a friend of yours showed interest in these fields but felt unsure about their talent, what would you encourage them to do?

User: I would probably tell them to practice and not give up, and that everyone has their own journey.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the wisdom to encourage others, so let’s apply that same kindness to yourself. What would be a small step you could take to start practicing your interests?

User: Maybe I could set aside a little time each week to work on graphic design or filming, just to experiment and see how I feel about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Committing some regular time could help build your confidence. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?

User: I feel a bit more optimistic about it. It sounds manageable, and I think I could stick to it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking manageable steps. How do you think completing these small practices will help you feel about your career choices moving forward?

User: I think it might help me figure out what I really enjoy and whether I want to pursue one of these paths further.

Consultant: Absolutely! Learning more about what you enjoy through practice will help clarify your direction. Now, do you remember any other thoughts or worries you've had about your career options?

User: I often worry that I might make the wrong choice and end up regretting my decision.

Consultant: That concern is quite common when it comes to making significant life choices. Let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that making a specific choice would lead to regret?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence; it’s more of a fear that’s been hanging over me.

Consultant: Fear of regret can often feel quite heavy, but since it’s not based on solid evidence, we can work on reframing it. What would it feel like to focus on making choices that feel right to you in the moment, rather than worrying about the future?

User: It could be a relief, actually. I think focusing on my current interests could take off some of that pressure.

Consultant: Yes! By focusing on your interests and what feels right now, you can enjoy the process without as much anxiety. How do you feel about embracing this approach moving forward?

User: I feel like I can breathe a little easier. It’s nice to think I can enjoy the journey.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Focusing on the journey can lead to more satisfying outcomes. To wrap up today, let’s talk about what you can do if feelings of doubt come up again while exploring your career options.

User: I suppose I can remind myself that it’s okay to be uncertain and that practice can help me improve.

Consultant: Exactly! And you can challenge those negative thoughts with supportive evidence. Remember, you're taking proactive steps, which is a big achievement. You're doing great, Xiao Ming!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate that.

Consultant: I’m excited to see how you progress on this journey. Remember, it's okay to reach out when you feel overwhelmed. You've made great strides today!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm glad to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last talk about your future?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my future, especially after those career counseling classes. I feel a bit more open to possibilities but still anxious about making the right choices.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you are feeling a bit more open. Anxiety about the future is quite common, especially when exploring new paths. Can you tell me more about the options you’re considering?

User: Well, I’m not completely sure. I have some ideas, but I still feel lost. Sometimes I think I’ll never figure it out, and that makes me more anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of hope and uncertainty. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. When you say you feel lost, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think things like “what if I choose the wrong path?” or “I’ll never succeed in whatever I choose.” These thoughts really weigh me down.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would bring about a lot of anxiety. Let’s take a closer look at them. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you'll choose the wrong path?

User: Well, I guess I haven’t really tried anything yet, so I can’t say for sure. But I also see my friends figuring things out which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It’s challenging when you compare yourself to others, especially your peers. Let's reflect on this: if a friend was feeling the way you do now, how would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to take time and explore different options. I would encourage them not to rush.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate advice. It's a reminder that it's okay to explore and take your time. How do you think it would feel to give yourself that same understanding?

User: It might make me feel a bit more relieved. I do need to remind myself it’s alright to not have everything figured out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that pressure off can create space for exploration and growth. What are some steps you could take to explore your interests further?

User: Maybe I could volunteer somewhere or try out a few different activities to see what I enjoy.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic ways to engage in new experiences! How do you feel about setting a goal to try one new activity this week?

User: That sounds doable! I feel excited about trying something new. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in different activities can often open new doors and help clarify your thoughts. How do you think you can manage any anxiety that might come up while trying new things?

User: I guess I can use some breathing exercises or remind myself that it’s just an experience, not a final decision.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Practicing mindfulness can really help keep the anxiety in check. Would you like to try a simple mindfulness exercise right now?

User: Sure, I’m open to that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to breathe. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and slowly release it through your mouth. Can you feel how that feels in your body?

User: Yeah, it helps to calm my mind a bit. 

Consultant: That's fantastic. Remember, you can return to this practice whenever you start to feel anxious. As we wrap up today, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think it’s important to give myself permission to explore and not rush my decisions. I also feel more confident after discussing steps I can take.

Consultant: Wonderful insight, Xiao Ming! It seems like you’re developing a clearer vision for your future while embracing the journey. How do you envision taking this forward?

User: I’ll focus on trying new things and keep practicing those breathing exercises. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s all about the journey, and you’re not alone in this. We can continue to build on these strategies in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we discussed your growing awareness of the importance of a career network. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident recently. I made some new connections, and it helps me see what potential paths are out there for me.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’ve been actively expanding your career network, which can be really beneficial. What specific connections have you made, and how have they impacted your feelings about your future?

User: I met a few people through a school event. They work in fields I'm interested in. Talking to them made me realize there are actually many options, and I feel a bit less lost.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you found conversations with them reassuring and that they opened your eyes to different possibilities. How did those discussions shape your views about your own future career plans?

User: I realized I don't have to stick to just one path. There are various careers I can explore, and that excites me. But I still worry about whether I'm making the right choices.

Consultant: Feeling excited about new possibilities is fantastic! Yet it's normal to have worries about making the right decisions. Can you share what specifically worries you about your choices?

User: I guess I'm just afraid of choosing something and then regretting it later. Sometimes I think about what if I fail or if I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Many individuals experience fear of failure when making career decisions. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might fail or that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, I've struggled in some subjects, and I see my peers doing better. It just makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: It sounds like your experiences in school are influencing how you view your abilities. Have you considered that struggling in certain subjects doesn’t define your overall potential or what you're capable of in the future?

User: I see what you mean. I guess I focus too much on those struggles instead of my strengths.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Let’s talk more about your strengths. What are some things you feel confident about, either in your studies or personal life?

User: I’m good at communicating with people and figuring out their needs. I also like helping others, which makes me feel good.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths, Xiaoming! Strong communication skills and a desire to help others can be invaluable in many careers. How can you leverage these strengths in your career network moving forward?

User: I could probably reach out to some of the people I met and ask for advice or insights. Maybe I could even shadow them to learn more about their jobs.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Asking for advice and shadowing can provide you with real-world insights and help you feel more connected to those roles. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: It makes me a little anxious. I worry they might not respond or think I’m bothering them.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about reaching out. However, many professionals appreciate the initiative and often enjoy sharing their insights. What would you say if you were to reach out to them? 

User: I suppose I could just introduce myself and say I’m interested in their job. I could ask if they have any tips for someone like me who is just starting.

Consultant: That’s a perfect approach! A polite introduction and expressing genuine interest are great ways to connect. Let’s practice what you might say. How about trying a draft message?

User: Okay, um... "Hi, I’m Xiaoming. I’m really interested in your career path and would love to hear any advice you might have." 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s clear and shows your interest. Remember, the worst they can say is no, but you might find someone who’s happy to help. How would sending that message make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel more in control of my choices, even if I’m nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s a really positive mindset! Taking action can definitely help you feel more empowered. Would you like to set a goal for when you might send out these messages?

User: Maybe I could aim to send one by the end of the week. That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal, Xiaoming! Setting a timeline will help you stay accountable. How do you foresee this action impacting your confidence in the future?

User: I hope it will help me realize that I can take steps towards my career, which should boost my confidence overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking those steps can significantly enhance your confidence and reduce feelings of anxiety. Let’s summarize what we've discussed today. You've recognized the value of your support network, identified your strengths, and planned actionable steps to connect with professionals. How are you feeling about your progress?

User: I feel much better. I genuinely believe I’m heading in the right direction now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoming! It’s crucial to recognize your progress and feel encouraged about your future. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you’d like to focus on in our next session?

User: I’d like to talk about how things went after reaching out to those professionals and maybe discuss more about my career options.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and exploring more options with you! Remember, you’re capable of achieving great things, and I believe in your potential. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoming. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

User: I guess I could remind myself that we all have our journeys and that it’s okay to have ups and downs. I could also prepare what I want to say in advance.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Preparing ahead of time can help ease anxiety. Have you thought about what else you might need to support your progress?

User: Maybe finding more information about workshops or connecting with people in my fields of interest. Networking seems important.

Consultant: Networking can absolutely open doors for opportunities. How do you plan to start making those connections?

User: I could join online groups or forums related to my interests and reach out to people for advice. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging in online communities can provide support and resources. How do you feel about taking that first step?

User: I feel motivated. I think I’ll start searching for groups today after our session!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Taking action right away can be very empowering. Are there any concerns or challenges you think you might face as you pursue these new activities?

User: I might feel overwhelmed with balancing everything, especially if schoolwork gets heavier.

Consultant: It’s good to be aware of potential challenges. How could you approach balancing these activities with your schoolwork?
