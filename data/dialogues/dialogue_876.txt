Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm really stressed about the exams. I feel like studying is meaningless and I can't concentrate. I just want to change this feeling, but I don't know how.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and lacking motivation to study. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you tell me about specific thoughts or feelings that come up when you try to study?

User: Well, when I sit down, I start thinking about how much I hate studying and how I’m probably going to fail anyway. That makes it really hard to focus.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts you have about studying seem to be quite negative and can contribute to your anxiety. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts arise?

User: I feel anxious and really discouraged. It's like I can't escape those thoughts, and they just keep looping in my head.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when those thoughts are so persistent. Let's identify if there are any specific cognitive distortions in those thoughts. For example, do you find yourself catastrophizing or thinking in extremes, like believing you'll definitely fail?

User: Yes, exactly! I often think things like, "If I don't do well on this exam, my life is over." It feels so real at the moment.

Consultant: That's a very strong belief. Let's challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports this belief? And could there be another way to look at this situation?

User: I guess I don't really have solid evidence. It's more of a feeling, like I just assume the worst. Maybe… it’s not the end of the world if I don’t do well?

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like acknowledging that there could be other possibilities might be helpful. If a friend were in your situation, what would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them that one exam won’t define their future and that it’s more about learning than just grades.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re capable of giving that advice to others, so let’s work on helping you believe it for yourself. What small, achievable goal could you set for your study sessions to create a more positive experience?

User: Maybe I could aim to study for just 30 minutes at a time instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting small goals can help build your confidence and momentum. How do you feel about trying that approach?

User: I feel like that might be easier to manage. I might not feel so overwhelmed doing it in short bursts.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let’s also think about strategies for maintaining focus during those study sessions. Have you tried any techniques, like taking breaks or changing your study environment?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just sit in my room and try to study, but it gets boring and distracting.

Consultant: Changing your environment can make a big difference. What if you studied in a different room or even at a library or café for a change of scenery? 

User: That sounds like it could help. A different environment might keep me from getting too distracted.

Consultant: Absolutely! And during those moments when you start to feel distracted, it might help to take a short break. For instance, set a timer for 25 minutes, study, then take a 5-minute break. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. I think I could handle that schedule.

Consultant: Wonderful! Implementing those breaks can really help you recharge. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on our session today. You’ve identified some negative thoughts about studying, accepted that they aren't always true, and created actionable goals. 

User: Yes, I see that now. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful, like maybe I can change how I study.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Going forward, keep reminding yourself of what we discussed. The next time you feel overwhelmed, try those strategies. You have the ability to reframe those negative thoughts.

User: I will definitely try! Thank you for helping me see things differently today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. You're making progress. If you feel stuck, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re here today. I remember from our last session that we were exploring your focus issues in class. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to pay more attention, but I still find myself daydreaming a lot during lessons. It’s like my mind just wanders off, and I can’t bring it back.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It’s good that you’re aware of it, though. Could you describe what thoughts or feelings come up when you find your mind wandering? 

User: Sometimes, I think about games or what my friends are doing online. I feel like I should be paying attention, but it’s hard to resist those distractions. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to get distracted by fun thoughts, especially when classes feel challenging. What do you feel when you recognize that you’re not paying attention? 

User: I feel guilty, like I’m failing my studies. It makes me anxious, especially when I think about my grades. 

Consultant: That guilt can be quite heavy. It seems like the pressure of grades makes it harder to focus. How do you think this worry affects your motivation to learn in class? 

User: I think it makes me want to give up. I start doubting my ability to understand the material, so I end up not trying at all.

Consultant: It sounds like a cycle where guilt leads to doubt, which then affects your motivation. Can we explore some specific situations where you notice this cycle happening? 

User: Often, it’s during math class. When the teacher explains something, I think it’s confusing, and then I freeze. 

Consultant: Noticing when this happens is important. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel it’s confusing? 

User: I often think, “I’ll never get this” or “I’m just not good at math.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. How would you feel if we tried challenging those thoughts together? 

User: I’m not sure. Can that really help? 

Consultant: Yes, it can! We can explore whether those thoughts are entirely true and find alternative perspectives. For instance, if a friend was struggling in math, what would you recommend they tell themselves? 

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that they can always ask for help. 

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive approach! What if you applied the same kindness to yourself when you face challenges in math? 

User: That sounds nice, but it’s hard to remember to be nice to myself. 

Consultant: It is challenging, especially when we’re used to being critical. How about starting with a simple reminder? You could write it down somewhere visible to encourage that kinder self-talk. 

User: That might work! I could try putting a note in my notebook. 

Consultant: I love that idea! Recording those positive reminders can help reinforce a more supportive mindset. What else could you do when you start feeling confused in class? 

User: I could ask questions or maybe take a few notes about what I understand. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging during class in that way can help refocus your attention. It also allows you to clarify things in the moment. How does that sound to you? 

User: It sounds manageable. I feel a bit more hopeful about it. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! As we’re concluding today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel has been the most valuable insight from our session? 

User: I think I realized that I can change my thoughts a bit, and that helps me feel less guilty and more in control of my learning. 

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! As you continue to practice these strategies, remember to celebrate small progress. What will you take away from today's discussion when facing challenges in the future? 

User: I’ll try to be kinder to myself and remember that struggling is okay. I can ask for help if I need it. 

Consultant: Very well said! You have the ability to manage those challenges, and I commend your effort. Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. 

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best to apply these tips. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to grow and change. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to come back. 

User: Sure! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join me today. I noticed you've been feeling a bit unsure about your abilities in science lately. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?

User: Hi. Yeah, I got a really low score on a recent science test, and I feel like I'm just not good at the subject. It's frustrating, and I don't know how to fix it.

Consultant: It sounds like that test result really shook your confidence in your science skills. I'm curious, how did that impact your feelings about studying in general?

User: I just feel like giving up sometimes. It's like, no matter how much I study, it doesn’t help, and I start thinking maybe I’m just not smart enough.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Failing to see any improvement despite your efforts can be really disheartening. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit—when you think you're "not smart enough," what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think about how my score compares to my classmates. When I see them score better, I feel like I don't belong in the same class as them.

Consultant: It seems like you're measuring your self-worth based on those scores and comparisons with others. How do you feel when you focus on those thoughts of comparison?

User: I feel really sad and anxious. It makes me want to just avoid studying altogether, which I know isn't helpful.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common reaction when we’re overwhelmed. What if we approach this feeling of inadequacy differently? Could we examine some of those thoughts and see if they are as true as they seem?

User: Sure, I guess. I just feel hopeless about my science abilities.

Consultant: Let's challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of any instances, however small, where you’ve succeeded in science or at least improved over time?

User: Well, I did get a better score in my math exam last month. I studied hard for that one.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Success in another subject shows that you do have the ability to learn and improve. How might your experiences in math relate to your potential in science?

User: I never thought about it that way. Maybe if I approach science like I did with math, I could see some progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Building skills is often about finding effective strategies. Have you tried any specific strategies for studying science yet?

User: Not really, I usually just reread my notes and hope for the best.

Consultant: Rereading can be helpful, but it might be beneficial to explore different techniques. For example, have you tried active recall or using visuals like diagrams to understand concepts better?

User: No, I haven’t. I’m not sure how to use those methods.

Consultant: No worries! Active recall involves testing yourself on the material to strengthen your memory, like making flashcards. And using diagrams might help visualize information—like drawing out processes or structures. Would you want to try some of these strategies for your next study session?

User: That sounds interesting. I think I could try making flashcards.

Consultant: Great! This could be a step towards regaining some confidence. Let's also set a plan for studying. How much time do you think you can dedicate to science each week?

User: Maybe a couple of hours after school each day? If I don’t have other homework.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By committing a few consistent hours to science, you might find it easier to grasp the material over time. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels manageable, actually. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s all about creating a routine that works for you. Aside from the study strategies, how do you think you can shift your mindset regarding your self-worth in relation to test scores?

User: I guess I should remind myself that my score doesn't define me. I can value my efforts instead.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Focusing on effort rather than solely on outcomes can be empowering. In moments of self-doubt, what could you remind yourself to stay positive?

User: I could think about the progress I made in math and how I’m capable of learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping those affirmations handy can help shift your mindset. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel like I have some strategies to work on improving in science and that I should focus on my efforts rather than just my scores.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to carry forward! It sounds like you're ready to approach your studies with a fresh mindset. Remember, your abilities can grow with practice, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. If you ever need support, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Keep up those positive thoughts and strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your studies and school life recently? 

User: Hi. I feel a bit better after getting praised in my language class. It made me feel good, but I still struggle with other subjects, and I’m not sure how to improve.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you felt good about the praise in your language class. It sounds like you’re gaining some confidence there! Can you tell me more about what you felt when you received that praise? 

User: I felt happy and recognized. It was nice, but then I thought, "What about math or science? I don’t think I can be good at those."

Consultant: I understand. That recognition in language is a great achievement, yet it's normal to have doubts in other subjects. How do you feel when you think about trying to improve in math and science?

User: I feel a bit overwhelmed. I don't think I can do it like in language class, and sometimes I just want to avoid those subjects altogether.

Consultant: That feeling of being overwhelmed can be tough, especially when the subjects are challenging. Instead of avoiding them, what if we tried to find a different approach? What small successes do you think you could aim for in math or science?

User: Maybe I could try asking questions in class or doing a few more exercises, but I worry it won’t help much.

Consultant: That's a good start! Asking questions can actually lead to clarity and understanding. Let’s explore what you can gain from those small efforts. If you did ask a question or completed some exercises, how might that make you feel about those subjects?

User: I guess if I understood something better, I might feel less anxious about them. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Understanding can reduce anxiety. Can we think of one specific question you might ask in math or science that could help you feel more engaged?

User: Maybe I could ask about a math problem I’ve been stuck on. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Remember, even asking one question can lead to progress. How do you think your classmates would respond to you asking for help? 

User: I don't know, maybe they wouldn't mind? They are usually caught up in their own things.

Consultant: It's quite possible that your classmates are receptive. Many people appreciate when others seek help; it creates a supportive environment. If they did respond positively, how would that feel for you?

User: That would probably make me feel more included and maybe more confident to participate. 

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling included can boost your confidence. Now, let’s think about how to actively participate in group activities or discussions, even outside the classroom. Have you considered any ways to engage more with your peers during group assignments or projects?

User: Not really. I usually just let others take charge. 

Consultant: I understand that can be a comfortable choice, but taking a step to share your thoughts can lead to more connection. What if you prepared something small to share in the next group project? 

User: That might work. If I prepared some thoughts, I’d feel less nervous sharing them. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Preparing can give you a sense of control. What topics are you interested in that might overlap with group projects?

User: I like stories and characters in games. I could use that in creative projects. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Stories and characters can bring a new perspective to your group work. How do you think sharing something you love would change your interaction with classmates?

User: They might find it interesting, and I could share my views more openly. 

Consultant: Yes! Sharing your interests can help build connections and confidence. Let’s also consider how to cope if things don’t go perfectly. How could you remind yourself that it’s okay to not be perfect?

User: I guess I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and it's part of learning. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself that mistakes are part of learning is crucial. By embracing this idea, it helps alleviate some pressure. How do you think this mindset could help you in daily situations at school? 

User: It would make me less afraid to try new things and maybe boost my willingness to speak up more.

Consultant: Precisely! Taking the risk to try can lead to growth. Now, looking ahead, what would you like to focus on next week regarding your studies and interactions with peers? 

User: I want to try to ask at least two questions in class and prepare something for the group project.

Consultant: Those are both excellent goals! As you progress with them, remember to reflect on how they make you feel. It could be a great way to improve not just academically, but socially too. 

User: That makes sense. I tend to forget to celebrate small wins.

Consultant: Celebrating small victories is essential! It reinforces your progress and keeps you motivated. In our next session, we can talk about how these goals went. 

User: Okay! I’m looking forward to it and seeing how it goes. 

Consultant: Great! I'm proud of your commitment to growing your confidence and skills. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. If you feel ready, let’s end our session here. 

User: Thanks! I feel more hopeful about things now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep focusing on your goals, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. It sounds like you’ve been exploring some enjoyable aspects of group activities. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since your team activity?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’ve felt a bit more confident after being chosen to plan the game. But I still struggle with talking to others outside of group tasks, especially with my classmates.

Consultant: I see. It's great that you've gained some confidence from the team activity! That’s a positive step. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about talking to your classmates?

User: I often think they won’t be interested in what I have to say, and I worry they might judge me or think I’m just being awkward.

Consultant: That sounds tough. So, it sounds like there's a fear of judgment that affects you. How does that make you feel when you imagine those interactions?

User: It makes me feel anxious, like I want to avoid talking to them because I’m afraid of being rejected or embarrassed.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Let’s try to explore this a bit. Can you think of a time when you successfully interacted with someone, perhaps during the planning of the game?

User: Well, I did talk a bit with a few classmates about what we wanted in the game, and it felt okay. They seemed to like my ideas.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! It shows you can connect with others when discussing something you’re passionate about. Let’s think about this: What would happen if you approached other classmates with the same mindset, focusing on shared interests?

User: I guess it could go well if I find common topics, but I still feel nervous thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous. How about we label that fear as just a thought, rather than a fact? What evidence do you have that they would judge you negatively?

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence. It’s just something I assume might happen.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Remember, those thoughts are just assumptions. Would it help if we practiced some scenarios together to build your confidence?

User: Yes, practicing would be good. I think it might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play an interaction where you approach a classmate. We can start by them discussing something related to school or shared interests. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’ll try to think of some things we can talk about.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s say you see a classmate in the hallway, and you want to start a conversation. You might say something like, “Hey, have you checked out the latest game? It’s pretty cool!” How does that sound for a start?

User: I think that could work. I’ll just have to remind myself to speak up.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, even if it feels uncomfortable, you might be surprised by their response. Do you want to try that line as if I were the classmate?

User: Okay, let’s try it. *clears throat* Hey, have you checked out the latest game? It’s pretty cool!

Consultant: *smiling* Oh, yes! I have! I really liked the graphics. What did you think about the storyline?

User: I thought the storyline was interesting! It’s fun to play with friends.

Consultant: Wonderful! That was a great exchange. You see how easy it can be? How did that feel for you to practice?

User: It felt a bit better than I thought it would. I think I could do that!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’re making excellent progress. Let’s discuss how you might implement this in real life. What would be a safe situation to try this out by speaking to a classmate next week?

User: Maybe during lunch when everyone is relaxed. I could try talking to someone about games then.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! You can also remind yourself of your successful experience from the planning. How do you think you can prepare for that moment?

User: I could write down a few things I want to say, so it’s easier for me to start the conversation.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Having notes can help reduce the pressure. As you practice this, it’s also essential to reflect on how it goes afterwards. Are you willing to check in with me next week about your experience?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely do that. It’s good to have someone to share it with.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! I believe in your ability to connect with your classmates. Remember, it’s all about gradual exposure and recognizing those small victories. 

User: Thank you! I feel more excited about trying now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re taking proactive steps. For our next session, we can talk about any challenges you face and celebrate your successes. 

User: I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Just know that communication is a skill you can develop with practice. Keep that positive mindset as you move forward. 

User: I will! I feel more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time! Take care!

User: Thank you, see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've been feeling better, actually. I was able to talk to my parents on the phone more openly about my studies and activities. They seemed pleased, but I still worry about balancing everything.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've been able to communicate more with your parents! It sounds like you've made some positive strides. Can you tell me a bit more about what worries you when you think about balancing everything?

User: I guess I just feel overwhelmed sometimes. Schoolwork is piling up, and even though I enjoy playing games and reading manga, I sometimes feel guilty for not studying enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a conflict between your enjoyment and your academic responsibilities. What do you think would help you feel more at peace with this balance?

User: I think if I could organize my time better, maybe set specific hours for studying and relaxing, it would help. But I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Creating a clear plan can definitely help. Let’s explore how you might structure your time. What would a typical day look like for you if you were able to balance both study and relaxation?

User: I usually go to school, and then I come home and... well, sometimes I end up playing games for hours. Maybe if I set a timer for studying first and then reward myself with some gaming, that could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive idea! Setting a timer can create a sense of urgency and make studying feel more manageable. How do you feel about making this plan a reality?

User: It sounds doable, but I worry I won't stick to it. I tend to get distracted easily, especially with games around.

Consultant: It's normal to have that concern. Distractions can be tough. What if we develop a strategy together that helps you stay focused during your study time? 

User: I’d like that. Maybe I can keep my gaming console in a different room while I study? 

Consultant: That’s a strong idea! Creating a distraction-free zone can help you focus. How about we set a specific timeframe—like study for 30 minutes and then take a short break? 

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Awesome! During those breaks, you can enjoy some gaming time without feeling guilty. How does that sound for your motivation?

User: It feels good to know I’ll have something to look forward to. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! In addition to this timing strategy, are there any other techniques you think could help you maintain motivation and focus while studying?

User: Maybe I could create a checklist of what I need to study each day. I like checking things off—it feels satisfying.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Checklists can provide a sense of accomplishment and keep you organized. How do you feel about starting to create that checklist for your upcoming week?

User: I think I can do that. It makes it feel more manageable when I can see what I need to get done each day.

Consultant: Exactly! Visualizing your tasks can help reduce anxiety about what lies ahead. When you think about this upcoming week, what goals would you like to set for your studies and relaxation?

User: I want to finish my homework by Wednesday and then have a gaming night on Friday. Also, I want to read some manga over the weekend.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! It sounds like you have a good balance in mind between work and play. How do you feel about sharing these goals with your parents? They might appreciate your plan.

User: I think I will. They liked my progress last time, so I can show them that I’m organizing my time better.

Consultant: That’s a great step toward maintaining open communication. Having their support can be very helpful. As we wrap up today, what do you think you could do if you start to feel overwhelmed again?

User: I could remind myself of my goals and maybe talk to you about it next time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. Let's summarize what you have set in place today. You’ve planned a timed study schedule, created a checklist, and identified engaging activities for balance. 

User: Yes, I feel good about this plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You've made tremendous progress, and I truly believe you can maintain this positive momentum. This will help strengthen your role at school and home. Keep communicating with your parents, and hold onto the positive changes you’ve begun. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s been a pleasure working with you. You have the tools now to continue making positive changes, and I’m confident in your ability to manage what comes next. If you ever feel stuck, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Bye for now! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care!
