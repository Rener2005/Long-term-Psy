Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I’m glad to see you today. I want to talk about how things have been going for you at school. Can you share a bit about your feelings lately?

User: Hi. I feel like everyone is against me. The teachers don’t understand me, and my classmates just ignore me. I had a fight with one of them recently, and now my parents want to transfer me to another school.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling isolated and misunderstood. Fighting might feel like the only way to protect yourself, but I’m curious—what do you think is the reason behind your fights with your classmates?

User: I think they don’t respect me. They never listen to what I say, so I just have to show them I’m not weak.

Consultant: I see that you believe fighting is a way to assert yourself. Let's explore that a bit more. What feelings come up for you when you think about your classmates not listening?

User: I feel angry. I just want them to pay attention to me and realize I'm serious.

Consultant: Anger can be a strong emotion. When you're feeling that way, what other thoughts cross your mind about how they are treating you?

User: I feel like they are all trying to push me around. It’s like they want me to be quiet and just accept what they say.

Consultant: It sounds really frustrating to feel that way. Have you considered other ways to express your feelings to them, other than fighting?

User: I don’t think talking would work. They wouldn’t care what I say.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can feel hopeless when you believe others won’t listen. But I wonder, if someone were being nice to you, how would you like them to communicate with you?

User: I guess I’d want them to ask me what I think instead of just ignoring me.

Consultant: Asking questions is a great way to open a conversation. Would you be open to trying this approach next time you feel disrespected by your classmates? We could think about ways to practice that.

User: Maybe. But I don’t know how to start.

Consultant: No problem! We can role-play a situation where a classmate ignores you. I’ll pretend to be that classmate, and you can practice telling me how you feel. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay.

Consultant: Great! Let's pretend I'm a classmate who just brushed past you without acknowledging your thoughts. You can try to express yourself to me. Go ahead!

User: Hey! I wanted to say something about our project, but you didn’t listen to me.

Consultant: I see! Keep going, how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel like I’m not important. I want to be part of the group, not just ignored.

Consultant: That’s an honest expression of your feelings. You want to be valued in your group. How do you think your classmate would react if you spoke to them like this?

User: Maybe they’d be surprised. I never talk to them like this.

Consultant: It could definitely catch them off guard in a good way! Showing your feelings can help build connections. Let’s think of ways to frame your message positively next time.

User: Okay, I think I could try that.

Consultant: Excellent! As we continue, let’s also consider how your past experiences might shape how you respond to others. Can you tell me about a time you felt someone understood you?

User: Well, my mom sometimes listens to me. When she does, I feel relieved. But I don’t think my teachers listen.

Consultant: That’s really valuable. It’s important to have someone who listens. What do you think is different about how your mom listens compared to your teachers?

User: She actually asks me questions and doesn’t judge me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach your mom uses. It shows her care and interest. What if you could remind yourself of this feeling when you're in school?

User: I guess I could think about how I feel with my mom when I’m at school.

Consultant: Yes! You could focus on that feeling of being understood as a positive example. Would you be willing to practice that more often at school?

User: Yeah, I could try focusing on that.

Consultant: Fantastic! Reflecting on the connections you make can help improve your interactions. Now, let’s address this idea of feeling judged by your teachers. What do you think leads you to feel that way?

User: They always look at me like I’m a troublemaker. They can’t see I just react to what happens around me.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel labeled by them. This judgment can be tough. I wonder how that affects your willingness to listen to their guidance?

User: I don’t want to listen to them if they think badly of me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s hard to accept advice from someone when you feel judged. Do you think there might be a way to share how you feel with your teachers?

User: No, I don’t think they’d care what I say.

Consultant: I understand that fear. What if you started by approaching them calmly? Perhaps you could share what you feel and ask for their support. Would that feel manageable?

User: Maybe I could try. I think they should know how I feel, too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings can lead to better understanding. I believe your teachers would likely appreciate your honesty. Are you willing to give it a try?

User: Yes, I think I can. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Xiaoke! You’re making real progress in how you think about these situations. Remember, by communicating your feelings authentically, you can pave the way for more positive interactions. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful about it now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! We can continue working on this during our next sessions. Just remember to keep practicing and be kind to yourself in the process. It takes time.

User: I will. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoke! I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes for you. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about what's been going on at school and how you're feeling about your teachers and classes.

User: Hi. Well, I feel like the teachers are always picking on me. They don’t understand me at all. I just want to have fun and not be told what to do all the time.

Consultant: I see that you feel misunderstood by your teachers and that this has been frustrating for you. Can you share a specific moment when you felt this way? 

User: There was this time in class when I was just joking around with my friends, and the teacher got really mad at me. I didn't think it was a big deal, but she yelled at me in front of everyone. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially being yelled at in front of your classmates. It makes sense that you’d feel upset. What thoughts went through your mind at that moment? 

User: I thought she was being unfair. It’s not like I was being really bad; I was just having fun. I don't understand why she doesn't like me.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt hurt and judged in that moment. Sometimes, when we feel like we're being treated unfairly, it can lead to thoughts that make us feel even worse. Would you say that you often feel this way about your teachers? 

User: Yeah, it seems like they just see me as trouble. I don't think they bother to see what I'm really like.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially if you feel like your teachers only see you as misbehaving. Let's take a moment to reflect on any positive experiences you may have had with teachers in the past. Can you think of a time when you had a nice interaction with a teacher?

User: Well, there was this teacher last year who was really cool. He helped me with math and made learning fun. I actually liked coming to his class.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like that teacher made a real difference for you. What was it about that experience that you enjoyed?

User: He made jokes and understood that sometimes I struggled with math. He never got mad at me like some other teachers do. 

Consultant: It sounds like his understanding and humor created a positive environment for you. How might you use this experience to see your current teachers differently? 

User: I guess maybe if I try to understand their side, I wouldn’t think they always want to make me angry.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful perspective, Xiaoke. It could help to remind yourself that teachers have their own challenges too. What if we set a small goal for you? Like trying to find a good reason behind something your teacher says next time, instead of thinking they’re being unfair. How does that sound? 

User: I think I could try that. It would be interesting to see what they are really thinking.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! You could even jot down your thoughts after the class. How might you feel if you noticed a positive interaction with a teacher over time?

User: Maybe I’d start feeling a little better about school. It could change things for me. 

Consultant: Exactly! Noticing those small changes can lead to a more positive experience at school. Let’s also talk about how you feel at home. How have your parents reacted to your struggles at school? 

User: They seem worried a lot, but they don't really talk to me about it. I don’t know what they really think.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling uncertain about how your parents view your situation. This ambiguity can cause confusion. What do you think has changed in your home life recently that might be connecting to how you're feeling at school?

User: I don't know. They keep saying we need to talk more, but I don’t know what they want to say. 

Consultant: That’s understandable, Xiaoke. Sometimes, parents might want to express their concern but don’t know how to start. It’s okay to be curious about their intentions. What do you think you could ask them to understand their feelings better? 

User: Maybe I could just ask them directly how they feel about what’s happening at school. 

Consultant: That's a courageous step! Opening up that line of communication could help lessen your anxiety about their reactions. How do you feel about trying that? 

User: I feel nervous, but I think it’s worth a shot. I want to understand them better.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious before having those kinds of conversations. Remember, being honest can help strengthen your relationship. Shall we think about how you could approach this conversation with them? 

User: I think I should start by telling them how I feel first. That might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Expressing your feelings can create a safe space for them to share their thoughts as well. After this session, what is one thing you feel inspired to do regarding the school and home situation? 

User: I want to try to talk to my parents tonight and see if I can tell them how I feel about everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Xiaoke! I believe taking that step can help you feel more connected to your parents and also change some perspectives about school. Let’s check in next time to hear how it went. 

User: Okay, I’ll do my best. Thanks for helping me think this through.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I appreciate you being open today. I look forward to hearing how it goes. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately about your family and school?

User: Hi. I feel kind of confused. My parents have been punishing me differently now, and it's really weird. I thought they would just get angry and hit me like before.

Consultant: It sounds like this change from your parents is leaving you feeling uncertain and even scared. Can you tell me more about what you think might be the reason for their change in how they handle things?

User: I don’t really know. Maybe they think I'm too violent? They keep talking about how to make things better, but I don't get why they care so much now.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel lost when things change suddenly. They might be concerned about your well-being and how your actions affect you and those around you. How does this make you feel about your relationship with them?

User: I feel like they might not love me anymore or something. If they cared, wouldn’t they just let me be? 

Consultant: That sounds really hard, feeling like you might lose their love. Often, when parents change their approach, it can be a sign that they truly care and want to help. How do you think a different way of communicating could affect your feelings toward them?

User: Maybe it could help? But I just don’t know how to talk to them without being rude or starting a fight.

Consultant: That's a good point. Learning to express your feelings without conflict can be very valuable. What would you want to say to your parents if you felt comfortable?

User: I guess I’d want to tell them I don’t understand why they’re acting this way and that it makes me scared they don't want me.

Consultant: That’s a powerful feeling to share with them. Let’s think about how to express that in a calm way. How do you think your parents might respond if you explained your feelings?

User: I don’t know, maybe they’d get defensive? Or they might just tell me not to act out anymore.

Consultant: That’s a possibility. It might help to approach them gently, perhaps starting with how much you care about them before sharing your worries. Would you feel okay trying that?

User: I could try, but what if they don’t listen?

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that. Sometimes it helps to remind them that you want to understand their perspective as well. Would you want to practice how you might say it together?

User: Yeah, I could try that. Maybe something like, "I feel confused and scared about the changes you’re making"?

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! You’re opening up the conversation rather than blaming, which can help them listen more actively. What else would you add to that?

User: Maybe I could say I really want us to all get along better, without yelling or fighting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Expressing that desire for harmony can encourage them to engage in a more positive way. How does it feel to think about having this conversation with them?

User: It actually feels a bit better. I think if I could just say that, it might help a little.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having those positive intentions can really change the dynamics. Now, let’s work on how to handle it if conversations don’t go the way you hope. What might you do if they get upset?

User: I guess I could just stay calm and remind them why I wanted to talk in the first place. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping your focus on open communication can help de-escalate tension. What do you think might happen if they see you’re trying to be calm?

User: Maybe they would be more understanding if they saw I was trying really hard.

Consultant: Exactly! It shows them you care about improving things. Now, thinking ahead, how might this change in communication affect how you feel about school and friends?

User: I might feel safer at home and can focus better at school? I don’t know, but it sounds nice.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Improving family communication can lead to better emotional safety, which often leads to more confidence in other areas, like school. Have you thought about how to get involved with others, like joining activities at school?

User: I haven’t really, but maybe I could join a club or something. It could be fun.

Consultant: Great idea! Being part of a club could be a fantastic way to practice positive interactions and maybe even make new friends. What kind of club would interest you?

User: I really like sports. Maybe I could join a basketball team?

Consultant: That sounds exciting! Basketball helps with teamwork and communication. Plus, it could be a good outlet for your energy. How do you feel about trying this new approach?

User: I feel more excited now! Joining a team sounds like a fun way to meet people.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Trying new things can open up opportunities for connection. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel will be your next step going forward?

User: I think I will talk to my parents and look into joining the basketball team. I want to try to make things better.


Consultant: Those sound like excellent steps, Xiao Ke! I believe you’re on the right path to improving your relationships and your own feelings. Remember, if things feel tough, it’s okay to reach out for support again. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiao Ke! I'm glad to see you here today. Last time we talked about your experiences in the group activity at school, and I’m curious—how have you been feeling about collaborating with others since then?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling better. I realized that working with my classmates is not as bad as I thought. In the group activity, I found it fun to share ideas and help each other.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive change! Working together and sharing ideas can be really rewarding. Can you tell me about a specific moment during the activity that made you feel this way?

User: There was a part where we had to plan a project together, and I suggested an idea. Everyone liked it, and we were able to finish it quickly. It made me happy that they appreciated my suggestion.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you felt recognized for your contribution! Feeling appreciated can really boost our motivation to work collaboratively. How did this experience differ from your usual interactions with others?

User: Normally, I just think about what I want and don't really care what others think. But this time, I focused on working with the others. It felt good to listen and be listened to.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiao Ke! Listening, and being open to others' perspectives can make teamwork much smoother and more enjoyable. Have you noticed any changes in how you interact with your classmates since this experience?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to be nicer and not jump to fighting if someone disagrees with me. Last week, when someone disagreed, I just explained my view instead of getting angry.

Consultant: That’s an impressive step towards improving your interactions! Explaining your point of view instead of resorting to anger shows growth. What do you think helped you make that choice in that situation?

User: I think it was because I remembered how nice it felt to work with my group. I didn’t want to ruin that feeling.

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive experiences can really influence how we handle tough situations. It seems you’re finding value in cooperation. What do you think would help you continue building on this experience?

User: Maybe I can participate in more group activities. I want to try being part of teams more often.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Being involved in more group settings can help reinforce your skills in cooperating with others. What kind of group activities are you interested in?

User: I’m thinking of joining the soccer team. I've always liked soccer, but I haven’t played in a team before.

Consultant: Joining the soccer team could provide a wonderful opportunity to practice teamwork and communication. It can also help you develop a sense of belonging with your teammates. How do you feel about that prospect?

User: I feel excited! But I’m a bit worried about not being good enough at soccer.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about trying something new. Remember, the focus of being on a team is to learn and support each other, regardless of your skill level. What could help you manage those feelings of worry before joining the team?

User: I guess I could just remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect, and that I’ll learn as I go.

Consultant: That’s a great coping strategy! Allowing yourself to learn at your own pace is important. If you find yourself feeling anxious when trying out, you can also practice breathing exercises to help calm your nerves. Does that sound helpful?

User: Yes, I think that would really help. I’ll try to remember that!

Consultant: Wonderful! As you prepare to join the soccer team, remember that it’s all about enjoying the game and building connections with others. How do you think you can communicate your thoughts and feelings with your teammates once you are there?

User: I might ask them how they think about playing different positions and share what I feel comfortable with.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Communicating openly and discussing roles can enhance understanding within the team. What other skills do you believe could help you in your interactions with your new teammates?

User: I think being open to feedback would help. If they say something I disagree with, I can try not to take it personally.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being open to feedback can strengthen your relationships and lead to better teamwork. What are some ways you plan to ensure that you remain open and receptive to their feedback?

User: Maybe I can practice saying "thank you" when they give me advice, even if I don’t agree. That way, I will remember to keep the communication positive.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Xiao Ke! Showing gratitude can foster positive interactions and create a supportive atmosphere. As we wrap up today, can you reflect on how these ideas will impact your interactions and your goals moving forward?

User: I feel more confident that I can handle group situations better now. I want to keep practicing these skills in soccer and other activities.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for recognizing your growth and setting these goals! Continuing to practice these skills will certainly help you. Remember, progress takes time, and it's great to see how far you've come. Would you like to set a goal for your next session regarding your experience in soccer or group activities?

User: Yes! I would like to share how it goes after my first practice!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. Remember, it’s all about learning and having fun. See you next time, Xiao Ke!
###################
Consultant: Hello, 小可! I’m glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, I guess. I’ve tried to talk to my parents more instead of getting angry. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It's a positive step that you're trying to express yourself without using violence. Can you share a specific moment when you communicated your feelings instead of acting out?

User: Well, last week, I was upset after a fight at school, but instead of hitting my friend, I told my parents about it and how I felt. They listened and helped me think about what to do next.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example, 小可! It sounds like you’re learning to share your feelings, which is an important skill. How did it feel to talk to your parents about what was bothering you instead of resorting to fighting?

User: I felt relieved. It was nice to talk instead of just being angry all the time. 

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for choosing to communicate. It seems like you’re experiencing some positive emotions as a result. Have you noticed any changes in how your friends respond to you when you express yourself this way?

User: Yeah, I think they seem less scared of me now. They even talked to me about the fight, and we figured it out together.

Consultant: That’s a significant change! It’s wonderful that you’re creating a more positive atmosphere with your friends. What other kinds of situations do you think you can apply this way of talking to your feelings in the future?

User: Maybe with my teacher when I have problems in class, or if I get annoyed with someone during playtime. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Communicating with your teacher or friends instead of getting frustrated is a smart approach. How do you think you can prepare for those moments to express your feelings calmly?

User: I guess I could think about what I want to say beforehand. Like, take a deep breath first.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Taking a moment to breathe and think about your words can help you stay calm and express yourself better. Let’s practice how you might approach your teacher if you have a problem in class. What would you say?

User: Maybe I could say, “I don’t understand this part of the lesson, can you help me?”

Consultant: That’s perfect, 小可! You’re asking for help in a polite way. How do you feel about saying that to your teacher?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s okay. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but remember that your teacher is there to help you. What do you think you could do if you start to feel nervous before asking for help?

User: I could just take a deep breath like we talked about.

Consultant: Exactly! Deep breathing can help calm your nerves. How are you feeling about your overall progress in reducing fights and improving your communication?

User: I feel happy and a bit proud of myself. I want to keep doing this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset, 小可! It sounds like you’re really embracing these changes. As we continue our sessions, we can work on more strategies to help you feel confident in expressing yourself. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on next time?

User: Maybe how to talk to more friends without feeling scared.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! We can explore ways to build your confidence in talking to friends. Lastly, let’s briefly recap your progress today. You've made significant strides in communicating your feelings, and it's shown in your interactions with both your parents and friends. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I am improving.

Consultant: Definitely! Keep celebrating those small victories. I believe in you, 小可, and I’m excited to see how you’ll continue to grow. Remember, practicing these skills will make it easier over time. 

User: Thanks! I’ll keep working on it.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Let’s continue this journey together next time. Take care until then!

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ke! I'm glad to see you today. It's good to hear that you've been working on your behavior. How are you feeling about the changes you've made?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, actually. I've tried to get along better with my classmates, and I think it’s working! 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're proud of your efforts to improve relationships. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in how you interact with your classmates?

User: Well, I used to fight a lot, but now I just walk away if someone bothers me. Sometimes, I even play games with them instead of arguing.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Walking away shows a lot of self-control. How does it make you feel when you choose to play games instead of getting into a fight?

User: I feel more relaxed and happy. It's nice to laugh and have fun instead of fighting.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. It seems like you're finding joy in positive interactions. Have your teachers noticed the changes as well?

User: Yes, they’ve mentioned that I’m behaving better. I even got some compliments for my improvement!

Consultant: That's excellent feedback! It sounds like your hard work is paying off. How have these compliments affected your motivation to keep going?

User: They make me want to keep trying! I don't want to go back to how I was before.

Consultant: That's a strong commitment! Let’s talk about how you can continue this momentum. Do you think participating in any clubs or activities at school might help you stay engaged positively?

User: I think joining a club would be fun! I like drawing and playing soccer. 

Consultant: Those sound like great interests! Getting involved in activities you enjoy could help you connect more with other students. Have you considered which club you might like to join first?

User: Maybe the art club! I feel comfortable drawing, and I think I would enjoy it.

Consultant: The art club sounds perfect for you. It’s a wonderful way to express yourself and meet friends. What supports will you need to help you succeed in that environment?

User: I think just encouragement from my teachers and family would help. 

Consultant: Support from your teachers and family is essential. Would you like to brainstorm some ways to ask for that support?

User: Yes, I could talk to my art teacher about joining and maybe invite a friend to come along with me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Including a friend can make it even more fun and supportive. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel excited! I think it’ll be a good change.

Consultant: That excitement is fantastic! It shows you're ready for this next step. Looking back, what do you think has been your biggest achievement in these changes so far?

User: I guess just being able to control my anger and make better choices. 

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Recognizing your progress is key to maintaining that positive direction. How do you plan to remind yourself of this progress when you face challenges?

User: I could write it down or maybe tell my parents about it.

Consultant: Writing it down is a great way to reflect on your journey, and sharing it with your parents allows them to support you more. Would you like to set a plan for checking in with them about your progress?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I can show them my drawings and talk about my experiences.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. Sharing your expressions through art can open up discussions about your feelings and experiences. Is there anything else you’d like to address in our time today?

User: Not really, I just feel happy about everything!

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re feeling happy! As we wrap up, let's briefly summarize your progress. You've shown improved behavior, a desire to connect with peers positively, and plans to join activities that interest you. What do you think is the most important takeaway from our sessions?

User: I’ve learned that I can change and that it's okay to ask for help and support.

Consultant: Absolutely, and that’s a powerful realization! You've worked very hard, Xiao Ke, and I'm confident you’ll continue to grow. Remember, if you ever feel challenged, reach out for support. This concludes our session today. Keep shining in your journey, and don’t hesitate to return if you need anything in the future!

User: Thank you! I will.
