Consultant: Hello, Xiaoliang! I'm glad you're here for this session. I want to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately. Can you share with me what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Well, I just finished my mid-term exams, and I didn't do as well as I hoped. I'm feeling pretty disappointed and stressed out.

Consultant: I can see how disappointing exam results can be overwhelming, especially when you put in effort. How is this affecting your feelings about social situations or interactions with others?

User: It makes me even more anxious about talking to people. I feel like they'll judge me or laugh at me because I failed.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, particularly when you're feeling vulnerable. Can you tell me about any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you're in a social setting, especially after the exams?

User: I often think that I’ll embarrass myself if I speak up or say something wrong. My heart races, I sweat, and I just want to escape.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety for you. If you don’t mind sharing, can you recall a recent situation where you felt this way?

User: Yeah, there was a group discussion in class right after our exam. I was so terrified that I just stayed quiet even when I wanted to contribute. 

Consultant: That must have been really tough for you. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment? 

User: I kept thinking that if I spoke, everyone would focus on me and see how nervous I was. I just felt invisible and wanted to stay that way.

Consultant: You mentioned feeling invisible, but also wanting to contribute. It’s tough to balance those conflicting feelings. Let’s explore that moment further—what emotions did you experience when you chose to stay quiet?

User: I felt a mixture of relief and regret. Relief because I didn’t have to speak, but regret because I missed out on sharing my thoughts with the class.

Consultant: It’s normal to have mixed emotions in such situations. It sounds like a part of you wants to engage, while another part feels very anxious about it. How do you think those feelings affect your overall confidence in social scenarios?

User: I think it really lowers my confidence. I often avoid situations where I might have to talk to people.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoidance can make it harder to build confidence over time. Let's think about the next time you're in a similar social situation. What small step could you take that feels manageable?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few points to say in advance. That might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Preparing ahead sounds like a great plan! It might give you a sense of control. Can we brainstorm some specific ideas you’d like to prepare for those conversations?

User: I could think of a few topics to discuss, like school projects or interests. 

Consultant: Those sound like good starters! Having topics in mind can ease the pressure. How do you feel about practicing these topics with someone you trust first?

User: That could be helpful, actually. It would be less stressful to practice with a friend.

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is a wonderful idea! It helps in building your confidence. How do you think you can overcome the fear of being judged during this practice?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's just practice, and they're there to support me, not to judge.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective to keep in mind. It’s about growth and learning rather than perfection. How do you feel about this approach so far? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It seems like I have some control over the situation now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! The key is to take small, consistent steps to face those fears. As we wrap up today, let’s sum up what you’ve considered doing moving forward.

User: I plan to prepare a few discussion points and practice with a friend, focusing on controlling my anxiety instead of avoiding situations.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan in place! Remember, it’s normal to feel a bit anxious; what matters is that you’re taking steps toward connecting with others. When we meet next time, we can review how these practices went. 

User: Thank you. I feel better just talking about this. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Keep being kind to yourself, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello Xiao Liang! Welcome back to our session. I know you've been feeling quite disappointed with your social performance lately. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been feeling anxious, especially after what happened during that class discussion. I couldn't speak up, and it's just made me feel even more embarrassed and frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I can sense the frustration you're experiencing. It's tough when you want to participate but feel held back. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when you felt unable to speak during the discussion?

User: I thought everyone would judge me. I kept imagining them laughing or thinking I was dumb for not speaking. This made my heart race, and I felt like I was going to freeze.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound overwhelming. It seems like you felt a lot of pressure to perform perfectly, which led to intense anxiety. What emotions did those thoughts trigger in you?

User: I felt really ashamed and sad. I just want to be able to talk without feeling like this. It seems impossible sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel that way, especially when you’re facing such intense pressure. Let’s try to break down those thoughts. When you think “everyone will judge me,” how much do you believe that thought? Is there any evidence to support it?

User: I think it's pretty real because in the past, I felt like people were always looking at me. But maybe I’m exaggerating it?

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing a possible exaggeration there. If you were to rate that thought from 0 to 100, where 100 means you’re absolutely certain “everyone is judging you,” where would you place it now?

User: Maybe around 80? I still feel strongly about it, but I can see it could be too high.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Moving from 80 to a lower score can be a first step. If you were giving advice to a friend who felt the same way, what other explanations could you offer about why people might not be judging you?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone is too busy thinking about their own issues to focus on someone else. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It can be freeing to consider that others might not be as focused on you as you think. How does that shift in thought make you feel about speaking up next time?

User: It makes it feel a little less scary, I guess. Maybe I can just think about what I want to say and not worry so much about others.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Focusing on your message rather than the audience can help ease some of the anxiety. How about we brainstorm some small steps for you to practice speaking up in a low-pressure environment? 

User: I think maybe I can start with talking in small groups or even just with friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Starting small can build your confidence. What specific situations can you see yourself trying this in?

User: Maybe in group projects or during lunch with a couple of friends. 

Consultant: Both are excellent opportunities! Setting a small goal, like sharing one thought during those situations, could be a manageable start. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I’m a little nervous, but I really want to try. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous. That means you're stepping out of your comfort zone, which is a positive sign. Can we set a specific timeframe for you to try this out before our next session?

User: How about I try to speak up at least once in the next week?

Consultant: That’s a great aim! After implementing that, I’d love to hear how it went. Remember, it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. What’s important is that you are taking steps. 

User: Thanks. I’ll try my best! 

Consultant: I appreciate your willingness to try, Xiao Liang. Also, remember that it’s not just about the outcome, but about challenging those negative thoughts throughout the process. 

User: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that. I can try to remind myself to look for evidence instead of just assuming the worst. 

Consultant: Exactly! Gathering evidence from your experiences is key. What’s one positive moment you can recall from speaking up in the past, even if it seemed small?

User: There was this one time in a group where my idea was actually welcomed. It felt nice, but I just forgot about it afterward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful memory to hold on to! It shows that your voice can contribute positively. Reflecting on such moments can serve as motivation during tougher times. 

User: I didn’t think about it that way! I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: Great! Remember, this journey is about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your strategies for the upcoming week?

User: I feel more hopeful and a bit more equipped to handle my anxiety.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made some important insights today. Let's check in next week and see how everything goes. And remember, you’re capable of overcoming this!

User: Thank you so much! I look forward to sharing my progress. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Liang! Take care until our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoliang! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you're facing some anxiety about your upcoming speech in class. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling right now?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious lately, especially since the teacher asked me to give a speech in front of the class. I keep imagining how it will go wrong, and I feel like I'm going to mess up completely.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoliang. It's understandable to feel this way, especially in a situation that feels so daunting. Can you share what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about the speech?

User: I think that everyone will judge me if I make a mistake. I worry they’ll laugh at me or talk behind my back. It feels like I can't handle it.

Consultant: I hear you. You're concerned about judgment and what others might say if things don’t go well. It sounds like these thoughts are really impacting your confidence. What emotions do you notice in your body when these thoughts occur?

User: When I think about it, my heart starts racing, I feel sweaty, and my hands shake. It’s like a panic attack just thinking about getting up there.

Consultant: That's a very intense response, Xiaoliang. Thanks for sharing that. It seems like your body is reacting quite strongly to the thought of speaking. Have you noticed if these feelings happen only when thinking about the speech, or do they occur in other social situations as well?

User: It happens in other situations too, like when I'm talking to teachers or even just trying to interact with my classmates. I always feel like I can't breathe properly.

Consultant: That must be very overwhelming for you. It seems like your anxiety is affecting many areas of your social life. Let’s explore this further. When you’re faced with interacting with others, what thoughts cross your mind at that moment?

User: I often think that I'm not interesting enough, or that I will forget what I want to say. I also think about how I wish I could just disappear instead of facing them.

Consultant: Those thoughts are very challenging and can definitely increase your anxiety. Let's take a moment to notice these thoughts and see if we can identify any patterns or distortions in them. For example, is it possible that not every interaction will lead to a negative outcome, or that people may not judge you as harshly as you fear?

User: I guess that could be true, but it’s hard to shake off that feeling. I just can't stop worrying.

Consultant: I understand. It can be really hard to change those ingrained thoughts. One approach we can use is to look for evidence against those thoughts. Can you think of a time when talking to someone turned out better than you expected?

User: Well, there was a time when I helped a classmate with homework, and they thanked me. It felt good, but I mostly remember the times it went wrong.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiaoliang. It’s great that you have experienced a positive interaction. Remembering those moments can help challenge the negativity. Let’s try to shift your focus. If a friend were in your situation, how would you advise them to cope with the anxiety of speaking in public?

User: I would tell them to breathe deeply and not to stress too much about being perfect. Just be themselves.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! You're capable of offering good advice to others, and you can use that same advice for yourself. Let’s practice some relaxation techniques that can help you manage your anxiety leading up to the speech. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I would like to try. 

Consultant: Great! One simple technique is deep breathing. Let’s practice it together. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Can you try that with me?

User: Okay. (Pauses) In... and out... It does help a bit.

Consultant: That's a great start! These breathing exercises can be very effective for calming your mind before a speaking situation. Now, how about we think about a small step you could take towards practicing your speech? What would feel manageable?

User: Maybe I could practice in front of a mirror? That way, I wouldn’t feel as embarrassed as speaking in front of the whole class.

Consultant: Practicing in front of a mirror sounds like an excellent idea! It allows you to observe your body language and gives you a safe space to grow your confidence. How many times do you think you could repeat that before your class?

User: I think I could do it three times a day until the speech. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Repetition will help reinforce your confidence. Remember to use the breathing techniques we discussed before you start practicing to keep anxiety at bay. 

User: I will remember. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, let’s talk about your feelings regarding teamwork and responsibilities. It sounds like you're open to participating, but there might be some nerves around it. How do you feel about taking on responsibility in group activities?

User: I worry that I might not do a good job, and then everyone would blame me. That makes me hesitate to join in.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have concerns about responsibility, especially when you’re dealing with anxiety. However, taking small steps can help build your confidence in these situations. Would you be willing to share your thoughts on how you could contribute to a group without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could take on smaller tasks instead of doing everything. That might help me feel less pressure.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Taking smaller, manageable tasks will help you build confidence while minimizing the pressure. Remember, every small contribution adds value to the group.  

User: I feel like I can try that.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Progress can happen in small steps, and recognizing this is important. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize what strategies you plan to implement before your speech and in future group activities.

User: I will practice speaking in front of a mirror and use deep breathing to manage my anxiety. I also want to volunteer for smaller tasks in group projects.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaoliang! You've already made significant progress in recognizing your strengths and finding ways to cope with social situations. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you can reach out to me again for support.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your ability to face these challenges. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoliang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been a bit anxious, actually. The group project at school has been making me feel pressured, especially since I'm the one responsible for things. But I also want to do well and help my team.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some pressure from being in a leadership role for your group project. It's great to hear that you also want to contribute positively. Can you tell me a bit more about how that pressure has affected you? 

User: Whenever I think about presenting our work or talking to my team, I start to feel really nervous. My heart races, and sometimes I sweat a lot. I just wish I could be more confident in those situations.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging for you, especially when you're trying to take on responsibility. It's understandable to feel that way. Let's discuss what it would look like for you to feel more confident and in control during these situations. What changes would you like to see?

User: I would like to feel calm when speaking in front of my teammates and maybe even engage more in discussions without feeling so anxious.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal to have! Let's begin by exploring some moments when you’ve felt slightly more confident. Can you share an instance, no matter how small, where you felt a bit more at ease in a social situation?

User: Well, there was a time during class when I answered a question that the teacher asked. I was really anxious, but I managed to speak up for a few moments.

Consultant: Great! It’s a big step that you were able to answer a question in class despite feeling nervous. How did you feel afterward?

User: I felt a bit proud of myself, even though I was still shaking a little.

Consultant: That sense of pride is very important! It shows that you do have the ability to overcome your anxiety in certain moments. Let’s explore how we can build on that success. What were some thoughts you had before, during, and after that moment in class?

User: Before, I thought I wouldn’t be able to answer, and I was scared of messing up. During it, I was just focusing on getting the words out. After, I was surprised that I actually did it.

Consultant: You addressed quite a bit of fear beforehand! It makes sense that those thoughts would create anxiety. What if we worked on challenging these negative thoughts and replacing them with more supportive ones? 

User: That might help... but I don’t know how to change those thoughts.

Consultant: No problem! We can practice that together. One way to challenge negative thoughts is to ask ourselves for evidence. Let’s take your thought, "I’ll mess up." What evidence do you have that this is true, or perhaps there are other outcomes that are possible?

User: Well, I did answer the question one time, and it went okay. I guess not every time is a disaster.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve just reminded yourself that you’ve had a positive experience in the past. Recognizing that there can be positive outcomes can help reduce anxiety. How about we use role-playing to practice responding to your team in different scenarios?

User: Role-playing? That sounds a little weird, but I’m willing to try.

Consultant: It might feel a bit different at first, but it can be very beneficial. Let’s imagine one of your team meetings. I can play one of your teammates. How would you like to start?

User: Okay, I'll try to introduce our project idea… but I might feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s completely fine! Just focus on expressing your ideas, and remember you can pause if you need to. Whenever you’re ready, let’s start the practice.

User: Alright, here goes. Hi everyone, I want to share our project idea…

Consultant: Great start! See how you’re already engaging? Take a deep breath, and continue at your own pace. 

User: Uhm, our project is about… exploring how renewable energy can affect our environment. I think it’s really important.

Consultant: You’re doing really well! I can see you’re passionate about it. What would you say next?

User: Um, I’d probably explain how it works and our research findings…

Consultant: Wonderful! The more you practice, the easier it will become. How do you feel now about what you've just presented?

User: A bit more relieved, actually. It feels nice to practice.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! The practice will help prepare you for the real situation. Moving forward, how can you incorporate this role-playing in your routine before each meeting or presentation?

User: Maybe I can practice at home in front of my mirror or with my family?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing in front of a mirror can help you build confidence in your delivery. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for this week?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll try to practice a few times before our next meeting.

Consultant: Excellent! Building this practice into your routine will help reinforce your confidence. Let’s also discuss how you can reward yourself after each practice session to keep you motivated. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. Maybe after I practice, I can watch a show I like or have some snacks.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rewarding yourself is a great way to stay motivated. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect on your feelings about this session and any other thoughts you have.

User: I feel more optimistic and ready to tackle the project now. Thank you for the support!

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaoliang! You’ve already made significant steps toward feeling more confident. Remember, you have the ability to manage these situations, and I’m here to support you whenever you need. Let’s continue building on this progress in our next session.

User: Yes, I’d love that! Thank you again!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until we meet next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoliang! I'm happy you’re here today. It seems like you've been experiencing some positive moments in social activities recently. Can you share how you've been feeling about those experiences?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit more confident since I started participating in sports with my classmates. They have been very supportive, and it’s nice to feel welcomed.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you feel welcomed and supported. How did it feel to participate more actively and receive that support from your classmates?

User: It felt comforting, actually. I usually find it hard to talk to others, so I was surprised that I enjoyed being part of the group.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you could enjoy that group experience! What do you think contributed to that comfort? Was it the activity itself, or perhaps the people you're with?

User: I think it was a combination of both. The sport made it easier to interact, and my classmates seemed friendly and encouraging. It was less pressure than just talking.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. Engaging in activities can sometimes create an environment where social interactions feel more natural. How has this experience impacted your feelings about joining other social situations?

User: I feel a bit more motivated to try other activities, but I still get nervous thinking about it. I worry a lot about what others think of me.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous when considering new social situations, especially given your experiences. What kind of situations make you feel the most anxious right now?

User: I guess public speaking or large groups where I have to take the lead. I just start imagining everyone judging me.

Consultant: That fear of judgment can be really tough. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about those situations, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that I’ll embarrass myself or that I won’t be able to say anything right. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of pressure. What would happen if you were able to challenge those thoughts? For instance, what evidence do you have that you would actually embarrass yourself?

User: I don’t have solid evidence. It’s mostly just a fear. I’ve never really tried speaking in front of a lot of people.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiaoliang. It sounds like these worries are more about fear than actual experiences. Let’s think about ways to gradually practice speaking in front of others in a supportive way. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. It’s scary, but maybe I could try with just a few friends first.

Consultant: Starting small is a great strategy! You could share something simple with a trusted friend. What topic do you think would make you feel comfortable to talk about?

User: I could talk about the sports activities we’re doing in class. I know a bit about that, and it wouldn’t feel completely new. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing something you’re familiar with can help ease some of the anxiety. After you try it, how do you think you might reflect on the experience to reinforce the positives?

User: I guess I could think about what went well and how my friends reacted. If they’re supportive, it might help me feel less anxious for next time.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on positive feedback will help build your confidence. How about we set a goal for you to share with your friends in the coming week? 

User: That could work. I’ll aim to do it by the end of the week!

Consultant: Great! Setting that goal is a perfect step forward. Let’s also think about how you can celebrate this attempt, no matter the outcome.

User: I could treat myself to something nice afterward, like my favorite snack. 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Rewarding yourself for stepping out of your comfort zone will reinforce your efforts. Remember, this is all about progress, not perfection. 

User: I like that. It makes me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Good to hear! And if you ever feel overwhelmed, we can talk about ways to manage those feelings together. What is one thing you can do if you start feeling anxious before speaking?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself that my friends are supportive. 

Consultant: Perfect! Deep breathing is a fantastic technique to ground yourself. Remember that you have the support around you. How do you feel about the plan we’ve made?

User: I feel more hopeful, actually. It feels like a manageable step.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Each step will build your confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and the goals we've set.

User: Sure! I’m going to practice speaking with my friends about our sports activities by the end of the week and treat myself afterward.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but also embrace the encouragement your friends provide. You’re making positive strides!

User: Thank you so much for your support. I feel like I can actually try this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoliang! I believe in your ability to navigate these situations. If you need any further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Liang! I'm really glad to see you again today. Last time, you shared how you successfully expressed your views during the class meeting. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I feel quite good actually. I’m still proud of what I did in the meeting, and I think it has helped me feel a bit more confident. I want to build on that momentum, though I'm still a bit nervous about future interactions.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you're feeling more confident. Let's talk about your future interactions. What specific situations are you thinking about where you'd like to apply this newfound confidence?

User: I'm thinking about participating more in group projects and maybe even speaking up in other classes. But the thought of doing that makes me a bit anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're eager to engage more but still carry some anxiety about it. Can you describe what thoughts come to your mind when you think about speaking up in those situations?

User: I keep imagining that everyone will judge me or think what I say is silly. I fear embarrassing myself in front of others.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. It seems like you're worried about being judged. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports this belief that others will judge you negatively?

User: I don’t know... It’s just a feeling I have. Sometimes it feels like people are looking at me, and I can’t shake the feeling that they are thinking something bad.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially if you're feeling vulnerable about sharing your thoughts. However, it may be helpful to look for other explanations. What do you think a friend would say if they were in your shoes?

User: A friend would probably say that it’s okay to make mistakes and that people are generally supportive. They wouldn’t think badly of me for trying.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great perspective to hold onto. Let's try to challenge those negative thoughts together. What if, during your next group project, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, you focus on the potential positives of sharing your ideas?

User: That makes sense. I could remind myself that the group might benefit from my input, and that could make me feel more motivated. 

Consultant: Absolutely! And we can also imagine some small steps you can take to gradually put this into practice. What kind of steps do you think you could try to ease into sharing your thoughts in these group settings?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my thoughts with just one person in the group before speaking out to everyone. It feels a bit less intimidating that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable approach! Starting small can be really effective. How does that feel to you as a plan?

User: It feels a lot less scary. I think I could handle that.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Also, let's create an action plan for your future interactions. What other situations, besides group projects, would you like to consider for practicing your communication?

User: I’d like to try talking more with friends and maybe even joining a club at school. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Engaging in conversations with friends and participating in a club can be wonderful opportunities to practice. How about setting a specific goal for joining a club? What club interests you?

User: I’m interested in the debate club. It could help me practice speaking in front of others.

Consultant: The debate club sounds like an excellent choice! You’ll have the chance to express your ideas in a structured environment, which can boost your confidence even further. How about aiming to attend at least the next club meeting?

User: I can definitely try to go to the next meeting. That feels achievable.

Consultant: Great! Attending that meeting can serve as a wonderful step forward. As we wrap up our session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What do you think are your main takeaways and actions moving forward?

User: I want to focus on my positive experiences and remember that others are usually supportive. My action steps are to share my thoughts with one person in group projects and to attend the debate club meeting.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiao Liang! You have made significant progress, and I believe you are well-equipped to continue this journey. Keep practicing those skills, and remember, it's okay to take it step by step. 

User: Thank you! I feel really motivated after our talk.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you've come a long way and should be proud of your achievements. If you ever need support again, don't hesitate to come back. Good luck with everything, and I believe in you!

User: Thanks a lot! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!
