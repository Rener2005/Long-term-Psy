Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! I'm glad you came to the session today. I want to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty stuck, like I'm in a cage. My academic competitions haven’t been going well, and I’m starting to question if it's worth it. I feel drained and just wish I had more energy and joy in my life.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and perhaps a bit of frustration regarding the competition. What do you think has led you to feel this way?

User: Well, I’ve been putting in a lot of effort, but the results aren’t what I expected. My teachers and parents are supportive, but it just feels overwhelming. Sometimes I wonder if I should just quit.

Consultant: I hear you. It can be really tough when you put in so much effort and don’t see the results you hoped for. Let’s explore your thoughts on quitting. What are some reasons you feel you might want to leave the competition?

User: I guess I feel like it’s taking away from other things I could enjoy. I’m not sure if it’s actually helping me learn or grow anymore. 

Consultant: It sounds like you might be weighing the value of the competition against your overall happiness and learning. What are some things that you think you could enjoy doing instead of focusing on the competition?

User: I really miss going outside and just enjoying nature. I used to love hiking and cycling, but I hardly have time for that anymore.

Consultant: Nature sounds like a vital source of energy and joy for you. If you were to step back from competitions, how do you think this would impact your ability to reconnect with those activities?

User: I think I’d feel a lot more free. But then I worry about disappointing my parents and my teacher, since they believe in me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel conflicted about disappointing others, especially those who support you. Have you had a conversation with them about how you’re feeling?

User: Not really. I’ve been hesitant to share because I don’t want to worry them or make them think I’m giving up.

Consultant: That makes sense. Opening up can feel risky. What would be a more comfortable way for you to initiate that conversation about your feelings with them?

User: Maybe I could start by telling them that I've been feeling overwhelmed. I think I need to express how the competition is affecting me emotionally.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point. By expressing your feelings, you’ll be giving them a chance to understand your perspective. What are the benefits you could see from sharing your feelings with them?

User: They might support me more or at least help me find a better balance. They probably don’t realize how stressed I’ve been.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes sharing helps others to see the whole picture. On the other hand, what worries you most about sharing your decision to reconsider the competition?

User: I’m worried they’ll see me as weak or lacking dedication. 

Consultant: A lot of people struggle with that fear, but it’s important to recognize that taking care of your mental health doesn’t make you weak. Let’s reflect on your dedication to the competition—what does it mean to you, and how do you define success within it?

User: Success used to mean winning or excelling, but now I’m starting to realize that it might also mean being happy and balanced. 

Consultant: That’s a really important insight. What steps can you take to redefine success for yourself right now?

User: I think I could set smaller goals, like spending time outdoors more often, while still studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Balancing competition and personal joy is essential. How do you feel about this approach?

User: It makes me feel a bit relieved, actually. Having an outdoor goal helps me feel positive. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, life is about balance. How do you envision the ideal balance between academics and your well-being moving forward?

User: I see myself allowing time for interests outside of studies, like hiking, while still participating in competitions but with less pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy plan! You’ll be working on both your personal happiness and educational goals. As we wrap up, what are the key takeaways from today's conversation for you?

User: I’ve realized I need to communicate my feelings more openly and give myself permission to enjoy life outside of competitions.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Xiao Yu. How will you approach this moving forward, especially regarding your conversations with your teachers and parents?

User: I’ll try to talk to them soon and share my thoughts about wanting to reevaluate my commitments.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive action plan! Remember, it’s okay to ask for help and discuss your feelings. You’re not alone in this. 

User: Thank you. I feel more empowered to approach them after talking with you. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember to take care of yourself, and whenever you need to talk again, I’m here for you. 

User: I will. Thanks for your support! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how things go for you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! It’s nice to see you today. Let’s begin by discussing how you’ve been feeling lately. Can you share a bit about your recent experiences with competitions?

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling quite down after a recent large competition. I really wanted to do well, but the results were disappointing. I’ve been questioning my abilities and if I made the right choices by dedicating so much time to competitions.

Consultant: I understand how frustrating that must feel, especially when you've invested so much effort. It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed and maybe a bit disheartened. Can we explore these feelings together? What specifically has been weighing on your mind?

User: I just keep thinking that despite my hard work, I didn't achieve the results I hoped for. It makes me wonder if I should continue competing or focus on other areas, like my regular studies.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel this way after a setback. You're in a position where you're evaluating your future path. Let’s try to identify what emotions have been coming up for you during this time. What thoughts are going through your head when you think about your recent performance?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just not cut out for competitions. I feel like everyone else is doing better than me, and I don’t know if I should keep trying.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoyu. It seems like you might be experiencing some negative thoughts, such as comparing yourself to others. Can you recall a specific thought that stood out to you during or after the competition?

User: I keep telling myself, “If I can’t even succeed at this, how can I do well in anything?” It feels like a heavy burden.

Consultant: I see. That thought sounds quite harsh and it seems to be making you feel even worse. Let's explore the evidence behind that belief. Are there moments when you’ve succeeded in other areas or received positive feedback?

User: Yes, in school, I usually do well, and my teachers say I have potential. I guess I tend to overlook those successes when I compare myself to others.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Your achievements in school highlight your capabilities! What if we challenge the belief that one setback defines your entire journey? What alternative thoughts could you consider?

User: Maybe I could think, “One competition doesn’t define my ability,” or “I can learn from this experience to improve next time.”

Consultant: Exactly! Those are much healthier perspectives. They recognize that setbacks are part of the learning process. How do these new thoughts make you feel compared to the previous ones?

User: I feel a bit lighter, honestly. It’s nice to think that I can grow from this experience instead of letting it weigh me down.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Recognizing that growth can come from challenges is key. Let’s also consider how you're feeling about the upcoming competitions. What emotions arise when you think about participating again?

User: I'm still feeling anxious about it. Part of me wants to back out, but another part wants to try again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel conflicted. It might be helpful to explore what specifically makes you feel anxious about competing again. Can you tell me what aspects are troubling you?

User: I worry about facing disappointment again. It’s just so hard to deal with those feelings.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern! It shows that you are deeply reflective about your experiences. What if we approached your anxiety with some small trial runs or practice sessions to build your confidence before the next competition?

User: That sounds like a good idea. Practicing might help me feel less anxious about the actual competition.

Consultant: Great! We can set some attainable goals for those practice sessions. This way, you'll feel more prepared, and it can also be a way to measure your progress. How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! If I can focus on those smaller steps, maybe I won’t feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on smaller goals can make the journey feel more manageable. Let’s also take a moment to reflect on your desire to back out. What does that decision represent for you?

User: I guess it represents wanting to protect myself from potential failure, but I also don’t want to give up something I’ve worked hard for.

Consultant: It’s important to honor that feeling of wanting to protect yourself from disappointment. It might help to balance that with a mindset of resilience. Can we develop a plan that allows you to engage with competitions on your own terms, perhaps with a step back if you need it?

User: Yes, having a plan sounds reassuring. I wouldn’t feel as trapped by my decision.

Consultant: That’s a productive approach! It gives you the flexibility to decide what’s best for you while still considering the option of competing. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway regarding how you can balance your feelings about competitions and your studies?

User: I think I’ve realized that it’s okay to feel anxious, and that I can address it by focusing on my strengths and taking smaller steps. I want to approach this decision calmly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight, Xiaoyu! Acknowledging your feelings and creating a balanced approach is crucial. As you move forward, remember that it's perfectly fine to take your time in making these decisions. You have the support to handle this, and I believe you can navigate your path wisely.

User: Thank you! This really helps me feel more confident about my choices.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, you can always reach out when you need support, and I look forward to our next session. Take care and embrace your journey, one step at a time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand that you're feeling quite anxious about the upcoming competition. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're experiencing right now?

User: Hi. Yes, I'm really stressed about the competition. I've been putting in a lot of time and effort, but my results haven't been as good as I hoped. I'm also unsure about whether I should continue competing or not, which adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a mix of pressure and confusion regarding the competition. Let's explore this further—what particular thoughts or feelings come to your mind when you think about the competition?

User: I often think that if I don’t perform well, I’ll let down my parents and my teacher. I feel like I should be doing better, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: I can understand why you'd feel that way; it’s tough to feel the weight of others' expectations. When you think about possibly stepping back from the competition, what thoughts cross your mind?

User: I feel a bit relieved when I think about it, but then I worry that it would be seen as giving up. It's a tough decision.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel relief at the thought of stepping back, especially when faced with so much pressure. Let's examine these thoughts together. What evidence do you have that stepping back would be giving up?

User: I guess there's no solid proof. It just feels like if I stop, I’m not trying hard enough. But part of me thinks that maybe I need a break to focus on my well-being.

Consultant: That’s an important realization—understanding that taking care of your mental well-being is essential. Can we try to look at this from a different perspective? If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to take a break if they’re feeling overwhelmed. It’s important not to burn out.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage a friend to prioritize their well-being. Now, thinking about your own situation, what would it look like if you allowed yourself the space to step back or to communicate your feelings to your parents and teacher?

User: I suppose it might help me feel less burdened. I could talk to them about how I’m feeling instead of keeping it all inside.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! How do you think they would react to you opening up about your feelings?

User: I think they’d be supportive, especially my parents. They always tell me that my health is more important than competition.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your parents are supportive! How about we role-play this conversation? I can act as your teacher or parents, and you can practice expressing your thoughts about the competition and your feelings.

User: That sounds useful! Okay, I’ll try. “Hi, I wanted to talk to you about the competition… I'm feeling really anxious about it and unsure if I should continue.”

Consultant: Excellent start! How do you think they would respond to your sharing that?

User: I think they might ask why I feel anxious and listen to me.

Consultant: Right! It’s important for them to know what you’re experiencing. You can also say how the pressure affects your well-being. Would you like to continue practicing this?

User: Yes, let me try again. “I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself, and it’s making it hard for me to enjoy my studies. I’m considering whether I should stay in the competition.”

Consultant: That's very clear and honest. It really opens up the opportunity for an open discussion. What would you want to hear from them after you say that?

User: I’d like to hear that they understand and support whatever decision I make.

Consultant: That’s a reasonable expectation. Remember, it's okay to express your needs. After discussing with your parents and teacher, how do you think you will feel about your decision regarding the competition?

User: I think I would feel more at ease. Even if I decide to step back, I would feel like I made a choice rather than feeling forced.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! Making a conscious decision can empower you. How about we reflect on any other strategies that might help you manage anxiety in the meantime?

User: Maybe I could set small daily goals to focus on instead of the competition. That way, I won’t feel overwhelmed all at once.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting small, achievable goals can gradually ease the pressure. What small goal would you like to start with today?

User: I think I'll focus on reviewing one math concept today. Just one small step.

Consultant: Perfect! That's a very manageable goal. As we move to the end of our session, let's summarize what we've discussed. How do you feel about reaching out to your parents and teacher now?

User: I feel more confident about it. It seems like the support is there, and I just need to express what I feel.

Consultant: Exactly, and you’ve taken a big step today in thinking through your decisions. If you need to talk again in the future or need support, feel free to reach out. Remember to take care of yourself!

User: Thank you! I feel better and more prepared to talk to them now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Yu! Wishing you the best of luck with your conversations and remember that taking care of your mental health is always a priority.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! Welcome to today’s session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been reflecting on my thoughts about the competition and my decisions. I’ve started to listen and accept some suggestions from my peers, but I still feel a bit hesitant.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're open to new perspectives from your peers. This is an important step! Can you share more about what specific suggestions you received and how they made you feel?

User: Some friends suggested I change my study approach, taking breaks and not just focusing on intensive practices. It feels refreshing, but it also makes me worry if I'm not putting in enough effort.

Consultant: I understand your concern. It's a balancing act, isn’t it? You want to achieve good results in competition, but you also want to be mindful of your well-being. What do you think a balanced approach could look like for you?

User: Maybe I could try mixing up my study routine, doing some practice but also taking short breaks outside to clear my mind. It sounds nice, but I’m still not sure it would be effective.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising plan! Mixing practice with breaks can help refresh your mind. What evidence do you have that taking breaks could actually be beneficial for you?

User: I remember feeling overwhelmed last month when I didn’t take any breaks at all. I ended up more anxious and less productive.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you've already experienced the negative effects of not allowing yourself breaks. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them regarding balancing study and rest?

User: I’d probably tell them to take breaks to recharge and not push too hard, stressing over every detail.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Now, how can you apply that same advice to your own situation? What small steps could you take to incorporate this balance into your routine?

User: Maybe I could set specific times for studying and specific times for breaks. Like studying for 25 minutes then taking a 5-minute walk.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiao Yu! It’s a well-known technique called the Pomodoro Technique, and it can really help with focus and productivity. How do you feel about trying this method?

User: I think I can give it a shot! It feels nice to have a structured plan.

Consultant: Excellent! I’m glad you feel positive about it. As you implement this, how do you think it will impact your feelings towards the competition?

User: I hope it will lessen my anxiety and help me feel more in control of my preparations.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! You’re actively taking steps to regain control over your situation. How will you track your feelings and progress as you start this new routine?

User: I could keep a journal, writing down my thoughts after each study session and noting how I feel about the competition overall.

Consultant: Journaling is a great idea! It can provide clarity and allow you to reflect on your experiences. What will be your first entry focus when you start this journal?

User: I think I will write about my initial feelings towards using breaks, how that differs from my usual approach, and my hopes for managing my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful way to begin! Reflecting on your feelings can enhance your self-awareness. As we continue, how are you feeling about your support system after sharing this with your peers?

User: I feel more confident. They seem supportive, and their suggestions make me feel like I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Support systems can be incredibly powerful. How do you envision strengthening this support moving forward?

User: I think I should initiate more discussions with my friends about our study methods and perhaps even form study groups.

Consultant: Forming study groups could be very beneficial! You can learn from each other and hold each other accountable. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I’m excited about it! It seems like a fun way to study, and I could use their encouragement.

Consultant: Absolutely! Supportive interactions can really motivate us. As we wrap up today, what would you like to take with you from our conversation regarding your feelings towards the competition?

User: I feel encouraged to experiment with my studies and take care of my well-being. I’ll try the breaks and keep journaling. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Xiao Yu! Remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask before we finish?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you for helping me see things differently!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session to hear about your progress. Take care until then, and enjoy your outdoor activities!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! It's wonderful to see you here today. I want to take a moment to appreciate your recent efforts to bring outdoor activities back into your life. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. The outdoor activities have given me some energy and confidence. But I still feel uneasy about my future decisions regarding the competition.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're experiencing more energy and confidence. It's normal to feel a bit uncertain about future decisions, especially when it comes to something as significant as a competition. Could you share more about what specific aspects of the competition are causing you this unease?

User: I guess it's mostly about my performance. I've been putting in a lot of effort, but the results haven't met my expectations. I'm worried that I might disappoint my coach and my parents.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel pressure, especially when you care about the expectations of those around you. Let’s explore your feelings about your performance a little deeper. When you think about your efforts, how do you feel about what you’ve accomplished so far?

User: I've worked hard and I know I've improved in some areas, but when I look at the results, it feels like it doesn't reflect my hard work. It makes me question if I should continue or change my approach.

Consultant: It’s tough when your hard work doesn’t feel validated by the results. You mentioned that you know you've improved, which is important. What are some specific improvements or achievements you can recognize in yourself, even if the results aren't what you'd hoped for?

User: I’ve started to solve more complex problems than before, and I feel more confident during practice sessions. It just seems like it’s not transferring over to the actual competitions.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement, Xiao Yu! Recognizing improvement is vital, even if it's not reflected in the competition yet. Sometimes, the skills we develop take time to show results in real situations. What do you think could be influencing this gap between practice and competition for you?

User: I think I get really nervous during competitions. I struggle to focus, and it feels like all my practice goes out the window. 

Consultant: That’s common, especially in high-pressure situations. You mentioned a desire to feel more in control and maintain your progress. Would you be open to discussing some strategies to help you manage anxiety during competitions?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to perform better and feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Great! One approach we can explore is developing a pre-competition routine that includes some calming techniques or visualization exercises. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I’ve never really thought about having a set routine before.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can provide a sense of structure and familiarity, which may help ease your nerves. What activities do you think you could incorporate into this routine to help you prepare mentally before a competition?

User: Maybe some breathing exercises and visualizing myself succeeding. I also think doing some physical warm-ups could help.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Breathing exercises can ground you, while visualization can boost your confidence. Physical warm-ups can also channel some of that anxious energy into a more positive state. How about we set a goal to practice this routine before your next competition? 

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to stick to it and see how it goes.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to keep track of how you feel before and after using this routine. It will give us valuable insights into what works best for you. Additionally, how do you feel about continuing your outdoor activities alongside your competition preparations?

User: I really enjoy them and they make me feel refreshed. I think I need to keep doing them to maintain my energy levels.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing both competition preparation and outdoor activities can be a great way to sustain your well-being. It seems like you've found a source of strength in these activities. How can you ensure you have time for them in your schedule moving forward?

User: I can plan to set aside specific times during the week for outdoors. Maybe after my study sessions?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Structuring your time to incorporate outdoor activities can help you maintain that positive energy. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on how you're feeling about your progress and future steps. How do you feel now compared to when we started?

User: I feel much more hopeful and clearer about what I need to do. It’s nice to see a way forward.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Xiao Yu! You've made some significant insights today. Remember, it’s all about balance and being kind to yourself as you navigate through these challenges. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. I feel more confident going forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I truly believe in your ability to manage this journey. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how things progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! I'm glad you've joined me today. From our last conversation, it sounds like you had a meaningful chat with your parents. How are you feeling about everything since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I really felt relieved after talking with them. I never really expressed my thoughts so clearly before, and it feels good to be understood.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling understood can be very powerful. It seems like your emotional state has shifted positively. How do you think this change affects your view of your studies and competitions?

User: I think I feel more confident now. Before, I was stressed about my performance in competitions, but now I realize it’s okay to not always achieve the best results.

Consultant: It's great that you're embracing a healthier perspective on success and failure. Emphasizing personal growth is so important. What specific strategies do you think helped you reach this understanding after your conversation with your parents?

User: Talking it out really helped. They provided their support, which made me reflect on my own feelings about the pressures I put on myself. 

Consultant: That reflection is a significant step! Self-reflection can be challenging but is often very rewarding. Considering this newfound awareness, how do you plan to approach your studies and competitions moving forward?

User: I want to focus more on enjoying the learning process instead of just aiming for high scores. I hope to set smaller goals that are realistic for me.

Consultant: Enjoying the process is a fantastic approach! Setting smaller, achievable goals can be very motivating. What kinds of small goals do you think you might want to set for yourself?

User: Maybe preparing for a few mini-projects in math instead of just focusing on competitions. I feel like that will help me learn without the overwhelming pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Engaging in projects can provide a sense of accomplishment without the competitive stress. How do you feel about setting these small goals? 

User: I feel excited about it! It feels more manageable, and I can appreciate progress without feeling pressured.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we look at the long-term strategies for supporting your growth, what do you think would help you stay accountable to these small goals?

User: I think checking in regularly, maybe weekly would help. I could even involve my parents to keep me on track.

Consultant: Involving your parents sounds like a wonderful idea. It can create a support system to help you stay accountable. How would you like to structure those check-ins with them?

User: Perhaps we could have a weekly family discussion where I share my goals and progress. This way, they can also give me feedback.

Consultant: That structure could be really beneficial! Creating open communication will encourage your growth and strengthen your bond with your parents. How do you think you'll feel after those discussions?

User: I believe it would provide me with motivation, and I would feel more supported along the way. 

Consultant: That's a healthy way to view it. Support can definitely increase motivation. As we conclude this session, let’s reflect on the progress you've made. What do you consider to be your most significant takeaway from our conversations?

User: I think being able to express my feelings and starting to set realistic goals for my studies is what I've learned most. It feels empowering.

Consultant: Empowerment is such a meaningful takeaway! Remember, recognizing and celebrating your progress is important. As you move forward, what strategies do you think will help maintain this momentum?

User: I want to practice self-reflection regularly and continue sharing my goals with my parents. That feels right for me. 

Consultant: That sounds great! Self-reflection and open communication will be important tools in maintaining your growth. I'm really proud of the progress you've made in our sessions together. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Yu! Remember that you're capable of managing your emotions and goals. Should you need assistance again in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Best wishes on your journey!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to applying what I’ve learned.
