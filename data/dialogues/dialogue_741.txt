Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you’re here today. Let's talk about what’s been going on with you lately. How have you been feeling about your relationships, especially with your dad and his new girlfriend?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty distant from my dad since he started dating someone new. I guess I just feel a bit replaced or like I’m not as important to him anymore. It makes me really anxious to see them together.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of loss and perhaps some insecurity in your relationship with your dad. That’s a tough situation. Can you share more about how this makes you feel when you are around them?

User: Whenever I see them, I feel awkward and out of place. I start to think that I'm just not interesting enough for my dad, especially compared to her. These thoughts make me even more anxious.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling like you're not enough in those moments. When you think those thoughts, how do they affect your emotions and actions? 

User: Well, I usually end up just staying in my room or trying to avoid interactions. I feel embarrassed and worried that they're judging me. It’s like I'm paralyzed from doing anything.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would want to withdraw when you’re feeling judged and anxious. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "I'm not interesting enough," what evidence do you have that supports that thought? 

User: I guess I don’t really have strong evidence. It’s more of a feeling I’ve always had. I keep thinking maybe it's true because I compare myself to them and feel inadequate.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others and feel like we fall short. If a friend were in your shoes, feeling inadequate in that situation, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their own strengths and that they shouldn’t put themselves down like that. 

Consultant: Exactly! You recognize that comparison isn't fair or helpful. What if you applied that same thought process to yourself when you start feeling inadequate? 

User: I guess I could try to remember that everyone is different. Maybe I can focus on my own strengths instead of just feeling like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Zhao! Focusing on your strengths can help shift that perspective. Are there specific traits or skills you have that you can remind yourself of when you start feeling this way?

User: I’m pretty good at playing basketball and I think I can be funny sometimes. So I guess I have that going for me.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! Using those can help you feel more confident in social settings. Let's think about creating opportunities to showcase your talents. How might you do that with your friends or family?

User: Maybe I could invite some friends over for a basketball game or try to initiate some light-hearted conversations at home.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging in activities that highlight your strengths can help you feel more confident. How do you think you'll feel after you try those things?

User: I think I might feel a bit more confident and less anxious about being around them.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! How about we set a small goal? You could try initiating one activity in the next week. How does that sound to you?

User: I can do that. I’ll try to invite some friends over this weekend.

Consultant: Awesome! I can’t wait to hear how that goes. As you prepare for this, what thoughts might come up that we can work on together to keep your confidence up?

User: I guess I might worry that my friends won’t want to come or that I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those worries are common, but remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. What would you tell yourself if those thoughts come up—what's a supportive counter-thought?

User: I could tell myself that it's okay if they can’t come, and that having fun matters more than being perfect. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a fantastic approach. Maintaining a supportive inner dialogue can go a long way. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you've made. What do you feel has been the most helpful part of our conversation today?

User: I think realizing that I don’t have to compare myself to others and focusing on what I'm good at. That really helps ease my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: I totally agree, Zhao! You’ve identified some powerful strategies today. As we finish, remember those strengths you have, and let’s aim for those positive interactions with your friends and family. You can do this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more confident about trying new things now.

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, it's about progress, and every step you take counts. If you need to talk again, I’ll be here for you. Best of luck with your plans, and I look forward to hearing how it goes!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially in social situations?

User: Hello. I've been feeling quite uneasy. Whenever I join social activities at school, I feel like everyone is better than me, and I struggle to connect with my classmates. I want to overcome this tension and feel more comfortable interacting.

Consultant: I understand that you feel anxious in social situations and feel like others might have better social skills. It's great that you want to work on this. Can you share more about a recent interaction that made you feel this way?

User: Sure. Last week, I attended a club meeting, and while everyone was chatting and having fun, I couldn’t get myself to join in. I just sat there feeling out of place.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhao. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're in a group where people seem comfortable. What thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I spoke up, or that no one would want to hear what I had to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. It seems like you're worried about what others might think of you. When you think those thoughts, how does it affect your feelings in that moment?

User: I feel really anxious and my heart races. I just want to leave the situation because it's too overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s quite common to want to escape when feeling anxious. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. How valid do you think those fears are? Is there any evidence to support them?

User: Well, I don't really know. I haven't actually tried talking yet, so I guess I can't be sure how they would react.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It sounds like you haven’t given yourself the chance to test those thoughts. If a friend were in the same situation, what advice would you offer them?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and that the others might actually appreciate them speaking up.

Consultant: Exactly! It's often easier to support others than ourselves. Let's think about how you can apply that same advice to yourself. What small step could you take in the next social situation to test out speaking up?

User: Maybe I could try asking a simple question during the next meeting. That doesn’t seem too intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with a small step can help you gain confidence. How will you feel if you manage to ask that question?

User: I think I’d feel pretty proud. It could help me feel more connected too.

Consultant: Feeling proud is a wonderful outcome! Remember, each small step counts. Let’s talk about how you could practice this further. How about we role-play a scenario where you ask a question in a group setting?

User: That sounds like it could really help. Okay, I’m ready to try!

Consultant: Great! Imagine we’re in a small group discussing a project. What question would you like to ask?

User: I might say something like, “What do you think is the most challenging part of this project?”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic question! Now, imagine the group responds positively. How would that make you feel?

User: It would make me feel relieved and maybe even more willing to share my thoughts.

Consultant: Yes, and that relief can encourage you to engage more! Remember, everyone in the group is there to learn and share, just like you. 

User: Right, I hadn’t thought about that. I guess they might share the same fears.

Consultant: Exactly! You're not alone in feeling this way. Recognizing that can help you feel more connected. What are you thinking about as we prepare for your next social interaction?

User: I think I’m feeling a bit more hopeful now. I'll try to remember to take that first step and just ask my question.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's a significant mindset shift. Before we wrap up today, what strategies can you put in place to remind yourself of this positive perspective when you're in a social situation?

User: Maybe I can write down some encouraging reminders or even rehearse what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Zhao! Writing things down can help reinforce your confidence, and rehearsing will make it feel more natural. 

User: Thanks! I feel like I have a plan now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you in this journey. Remember, it’s all about practice and patience with yourself. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll definitely keep trying to connect with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Keep pushing yourself gently, and I truly believe you can improve your social interactions. I’ll be here when you’re ready for our next session. 

User: Thanks for your help today. I’m looking forward to trying out these strategies.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Zhao! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. Let's dive into our session. How have you been feeling about your social interactions recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really uncertain about my social skills. I tried to communicate with my roommates, but it didn't go well, and I felt disappointed.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds frustrating when things don’t go the way we hope. Can you tell me more about what happened during your attempts to talk to them?

User: Well, I wanted to join in on their conversations, but I just froze up. I couldn't think of anything to say, and it seemed like they weren't interested.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel disheartened in situations like this. What thoughts were running through your mind while you were trying to join in?

User: I kept thinking that maybe they didn’t want me around, or that I wasn't interesting enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite impactful. It's easy to jump to conclusions about how others perceive us. Can we explore how those thoughts made you feel? 

User: They intensified my anxiety. I felt helpless and a bit embarrassed for not being able to connect.

Consultant: Emotional responses like anxiety can often stem from our thoughts. It sounds like you might be being pretty hard on yourself. What would happen if you viewed the situation differently? 

User: I suppose I could think that they might just have been distracted or busy. 

Consultant: That's a much more balanced perspective! It’s important to consider alternative explanations. Can you identify any specific instances where you felt differently, or perhaps instances where your thoughts were challenged?

User: There was a time when I joked around with them about something funny we all saw on TV. We all laughed, and it felt good!

Consultant: That sounds like a positive interaction! It's great to hear that you could connect with them through humor. We can build on that experience to enhance your confidence. What other strategies do you think might help you engage with your roommates again?

User: Maybe I can find common interests to talk about. Like, I know they enjoy sports. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing common interests can break the ice. Would you feel comfortable bringing up a sports topic next time you see them?

User: Yes, that makes sense! I think I can try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, every small step counts. Is there a particular sports event or news related to sports that you could mention to start a conversation?

User: There's a big game this weekend. I could ask if they are going to watch it.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opener! It’s relatable and gives them a chance to share their thoughts. How would you feel about initiating that conversation?

User: I feel a little nervous, but I think I can do it if I plan ahead.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. How about we practice how you might phrase that question to your roommates?

User: Sure! I could say, “Hey, are you guys going to watch the game this weekend?”

Consultant: That sounds great! Simple and direct. If it helps, consider adding a follow-up, like asking their predictions about the game. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! It gives me something to add on if they respond.

Consultant: Exactly! It creates a flow in the conversation. Remember, being genuinely interested in their responses can foster engagement. What do you think might help you manage any anxiety if it arises during the conversation?

User: I think taking a deep breath before speaking might help, or just reminding myself that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking a deep breath can ground you, and reminding yourself that it's okay to feel that way can ease some pressure. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway regarding your social interactions?

User: I feel more confident that I can connect with my roommates. I just need to take it step by step.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Embracing a step-by-step approach can build your confidence over time. How do you feel about your readiness to try out these strategies in your next interaction?

User: I feel optimistic and a bit excited now. I think I can do it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember to celebrate each attempt, no matter the outcome. I believe you can create positive interactions with your roommates. If you encounter any challenges, I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely keep practicing.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your progress today. Remember, it’s all about practice and being kind to yourself in this journey. Looking forward to our next session to hear about how it went! 

User: Me too! Thanks again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling about your social activities since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit more confident. I attended a social event at school recently, and I tried to engage more. It was a little scary, but I think I did okay.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you stepped out of your comfort zone, which is a great achievement. Can you tell me more about how you felt during the event?

User: At first, I was really nervous. I thought about whether people would like me or if they would ignore me. But once I started talking to a few people, it felt easier. I even had a couple of good conversations!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous before engaging with others, and it’s great that you pushed through that initial anxiety. What aspects of the conversations made you feel more at ease?

User: I think it was just realizing that most people were friendly and didn’t bite! Connecting over shared interests helped too. I felt like I belonged a bit.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! Recognizing that others are open and friendly can really help ease anxiety. How did you respond to any negative thoughts that popped into your mind during the event?

User: Honestly, at first, I kept thinking, “What if they don’t want to talk to me?” But I reminded myself that it was okay to try, that I wasn’t going to be rejected outright.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy—challenging negative thoughts and reminding yourself of the possibility of positive interactions. What do you think you can do to continue building on this experience in future social events?

User: I think I want to prepare some topics to talk about beforehand, just in case. And I want to try to focus on enjoying the moment instead of worrying too much.

Consultant: Those are solid plans! Preparing topics can help ease anxiety, and focusing on the present can make interactions more enjoyable. How do you feel about your father’s new relationship impacting your social experiences?

User: I’ve been thinking about that. I guess I’m okay with it for now. I mean, it’s a bit weird sometimes, but it makes me want to branch out and socialize more, I guess.

Consultant: It sounds like you are approaching this situation with an open mind. It's encouraging that you feel motivated to connect with others despite changes at home. How do you think this might affect your relationships at school?

User: I think it could help me be more open with my friends if I stay positive. If I'm less worried, I could share a bit more, which might deepen those friendships.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being more open can create stronger connections with your peers. Perhaps we can brainstorm some additional skills or techniques to help you feel even more comfortable with sharing?

User: Yeah, that sounds good! Maybe I could practice active listening, so I can engage better when others are talking.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Active listening can really enhance conversations and help you connect with others. Would you like us to role-play a scenario to practice this?

User: Sure, I’d like that. It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's imagine a situation where you're meeting someone new at an event. You start with a greeting, and let’s see how you would carry the conversation forward.

User: Alright. “Hi! I'm Zhao, nice to meet you. What did you think of the event?”

Consultant: That’s a great opener! It invites them to share their thoughts. After they respond, how could you actively listen and build on that?

User: I guess I could ask follow-up questions based on what they say, like, "What was your favorite part?" 

Consultant: Exactly! Following up with questions shows that you're genuinely interested in their experiences. How do you feel about practicing another scenario?

User: I’m feeling more confident about this. Sure, let's do another one!

Consultant: Great! Let's say someone mentions they like a band you enjoy. How can you respond while being an active listener?

User: “Oh, I love that band! What’s your favorite song? I think they really captured great emotions in their music.”

Consultant: That’s perfect! You're articulating your shared interest while encouraging them to express their thoughts. How does practicing this technique make you feel?

User: It feels really good! I think I can do this. I just need to keep practicing and not be afraid of the outcomes.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s all about practice, and it’s wonderful to see your growth. As we wrap up today, can you reflect on your progress and how you’ll continue building these social skills?

User: I’ve learned a lot about being open and approaching conversations with curiosity. I want to keep trying and remember to focus on enjoying time with others.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Zhao! Remember, each interaction is an opportunity to learn and grow. I have no doubt that you’ll continue to build your confidence and connections. 

User: Thanks, I really appreciate your guidance. I feel much more ready to tackle my social life now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made great strides, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the meantime. 

User: I will! Thanks again for everything. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been experiencing some positive changes in your family relationships lately. Can you share how you're feeling about those improvements?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel more at ease with my father and his girlfriend. It's nice to have that support, especially after everything that happened with my parents' divorce. I’ve also been trying to be more proactive in my social life.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling supported at home can really boost your confidence in other areas of your life. What specific actions or steps have you taken to be more proactive in your social interactions?

User: I've started reaching out to some classmates more often, inviting them to study together or hang out. It feels good to connect with them rather than just sticking to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! How have those invitations been received? Have you noticed any changes in how you feel during those interactions?

User: Most of them have been positive responses! It feels nice when they agree to hang out. I do feel a bit anxious before asking, but once it’s done, I generally feel relieved.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel some anxiety before reaching out to others. Let’s explore that anxiety a little further. What kinds of thoughts run through your mind just before you invite someone to hang out?

User: I usually think they might say no or that they don’t want to be friends with me. It’s like I worry they’ll think I’m annoying.

Consultant: I see, so you’re worried about how they might perceive you. This is a common concern. Let's consider this thought—what evidence do you have that supports the idea that they would find you annoying?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence. They've been friendly towards me in class, and most people seem to appreciate getting invitations.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It sounds like the evidence suggests they enjoy your company. What alternative thoughts could you have in those moments instead of worrying about being seen as annoying?

User: Maybe I could think that they might appreciate my effort to connect and that they are likely open to spending time together.

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! Imagining that your efforts to connect are appreciated can help reduce that anxiety. Moving forward, how do you feel about practicing this new way of thinking before you reach out to someone?

User: I think I can try that! It will take some time to get used to it, but I believe it could help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely, practice is key! In the meantime, have you had any recent experiences in social situations where you felt confident and happy?

User: Last week, I went out for coffee with a couple of classmates. We had a great time talking about our classes and future plans. I felt really engaged.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! What do you think contributed to your sense of engagement during that outing?

User: I think it was just the relaxed atmosphere and the fact that we all shared common interests. It felt good to simply talk and enjoy each other’s company.

Consultant: It’s great to know that you can enjoy those moments! Let’s think of ways to create similar environments in your future social interactions. Are there any specific scenarios or activities you’d like to plan where you can feel that sense of engagement again?

User: I’d love to organize a game night! I think it would be a fun way to get to know my classmates better and let everyone relax.

Consultant: A game night sounds like a fantastic idea! It can be a fun way to bond with others. What steps do you think you should take to organize that event?

User: I could start by creating a group message to gauge interest, then suggest a date and some games we could play.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! By starting a group message, you're taking the lead and inviting participation. How do you feel about initiating that conversation?

User: It makes me a little nervous, but I'm excited too! I think it will be fun if everyone joins in. 

Consultant: Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness is completely normal. Remember to remind yourself of the evidence that supports a positive outcome. Once you send that message, how do you anticipate feeling afterward?

User: I think I’ll feel proud of myself for taking the initiative, and hopefully, relieved if people respond positively.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Taking that step reinforces your confidence and builds your social skills. As we wrap up today's session, let’s summarize what you've learned. Can you share some key takeaways from our discussion?

User: I learned to challenge my negative thoughts about socializing, and I want to focus on the positive feedback I’ve received so far. Also, planning a game night seems promising!

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways, Zhao! You’ve made significant progress in building your social confidence, and I believe you’re well on your way to further enhancing your skills. If you continue to practice these strategies and take small steps, you’ll feel more comfortable moving forward. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more optimistic about my social life now.

Consultant: You're welcome! It’s been great to see your progress. Remember, you can always come back if you need further support. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your game night soon!

Consultant: Hello, Zhaomao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I've made some new friends at university, and I'm feeling more confident in my social skills.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and having positive experiences with your new friends. Can you share more about how your social interactions have improved?

User: Well, I've joined a study group and I've been participating more in activities. I feel less anxious when meeting new people. It's a nice change from how I used to feel.

Consultant: It seems like you're really taking steps to engage more in your social life. That's a big achievement! What specific changes have you noticed in yourself when you're in social situations?

User: I think I’m more open to talking and sharing my thoughts. I don’t second-guess myself as much anymore, which feels liberating.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Zhaomao! Feeling free to express yourself is essential in building connections. How have you been managing any lingering anxieties, if there are any?

User: I still feel a bit nervous sometimes, especially when there's a lot of pressure to socialize, like at group gatherings. But I'm learning to take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: Deep breathing techniques are a great way to manage anxiety. It sounds like you're developing some effective coping strategies. If you encounter those nerves, what steps do you think you can take to further ease them?

User: I could try to remind myself that everyone is there to have fun, just like me. Maybe setting small goals for each social event could help, too.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is an excellent idea! It can help you feel a sense of accomplishment without overwhelming yourself. What kind of goals do you think would be beneficial for your next social event?

User: Maybe I can aim to talk to at least two new people and share something about myself. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds very realistic and achievable! By setting those goals, you're creating opportunities for meaningful connections while also challenging yourself gently. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited about it! It seems doable, and I think it could really help me grow further.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too! Continuous growth in social settings can lead to even more confidence. As you move forward, what resources or support systems can you utilize to help you with these goals?

User: I've got my study group and some other friends who are very supportive. I could also talk to my dad about my experiences to get his perspective.

Consultant: Perfect! Having a supportive network is vital. Sharing your experiences with those who care about you can also reinforce your confidence. How do you envision using their support after you tackle those social goals?

User: I could share how things went after the events. It would be helpful to get their feedback and encouragement, especially if I feel nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping an open dialogue with your support system can provide both motivation and reassurance. As we summarize today, what do you think you've learned or gained from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that my anxiety is manageable and that I have the skills to improve my social experiences. Having a plan makes me feel empowered.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway, Zhaomao! Recognizing that you have the skills to manage your anxiety is an essential part of your progress. Looking ahead, how can you maintain this positive momentum in your social life?

User: I can keep setting small goals and remind myself to celebrate my successes, no matter how small. Staying connected with friends will help too.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Celebrating your successes is vital for reinforcing positive habits and feelings. As we conclude our session today, remember that you have the tools and support you need to continue fostering your social confidence.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate all this guidance. I feel ready for my upcoming interactions!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhaomao! I'm proud of how far you've come. If challenges arise in the future, remember you can always reach out. Have a great time connecting with your friends!

User: Thank you! I look forward to applying what I've learned.
