Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to have you here today. I’d like to talk about what you’ve been feeling recently. Can you tell me more about your experience with kindergarten?

User: Hi! Well, I don't really like kindergarten. Every time my mom leaves me there, I just feel so scared and I want her to come back. I even cried and told her I wanted to stay home.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been feeling really scared and anxious about being separated from your mom. That must be very tough for you. What kind of things do you think about when you’re in kindergarten?

User: I think about how much I want to be with my mom. I feel like I can't play or have fun, and I just miss her all the time. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Missing your mom can make it hard to enjoy your time at school. Have there been specific moments or activities in kindergarten that make you feel even more upset?

User: Yes! When I see other kids playing together, I feel left out and I just want to cry. It makes me not want to go at all.

Consultant: Feeling left out can be really hard, especially when you want to be part of the fun. What if we try to think together about what might help you feel a bit better in those moments? 

User: That might help, but I still don’t want to go back to kindergarten!

Consultant: That's okay to feel that way for now. It’s a big change, and it’s alright to take your time. What do you think would make you feel a bit more comfortable about going back, even a little bit?

User: Maybe if I could take a toy or something that reminds me of my mom...

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Bringing a toy that makes you feel safe can help. We can also play a little game where you pretend to be at school with your toy, which might make it feel more familiar. Would you like to try that?

User: Playing a game sounds fun! I think that could help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re at kindergarten with your toy. What do you think you would do first? 

User: I could maybe play with the blocks. I like building things. 

Consultant: Building with blocks sounds exciting! What if your toy is helping you build something really cool? How do you think that would feel?

User: It would be fun! I wouldn’t feel so alone if my toy is there with me.

Consultant: Exactly! Your toy can be your friend at school. And remember, you can always look forward to seeing your mom after school too. What are some fun things you could do together when you get home?

User: We could read my favorite story or go to the park. 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely plan! Having those activities to look forward to can make the time apart feel a little easier. How do you think you could practice feeling okay about being at kindergarten?

User: Maybe I could try going for just a little bit each day. That way it won’t be so scary.

Consultant: That’s a good idea! Going for a little while might help you get used to it bit by bit. If you feel brave, you can share with your teacher that you brought your special toy. How do you think she would react?

User: I think she would be nice and maybe help me play with it!

Consultant: Yes, I think she would want to help you feel comfortable. You’re very brave for thinking about this! What do you think your mom might say when you tell her about your plans?

User: I think she would be happy and say it’s okay to take my toy.

Consultant: Absolutely! She would be proud of you for finding ways to feel better about school. Just remember, it’s perfectly okay to miss your mom. Would you like to take a moment to think of one small step you can take before your next day at kindergarten?

User: I think I can try to pack my toy tonight.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect step to help you prepare. I believe you can do it! What about your feelings as we talk about this? Do you feel a little less scared?

User: A little bit less scared, yes. It helps to talk about it. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it's always okay to share your feelings. It’s a big change and I’m here to support you. Do you feel ready to try going back to kindergarten soon? 

User: I think I can try going back. Just for a little while with my toy.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging! You’re taking such great steps forward. Just remember, if you ever feel unsure or scared, you can always talk to your mom or your teacher too. 

User: I will. Thank you for helping me feel better.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You’re doing an amazing job. I believe in you. Next time we meet, we can talk about how it went and continue working together. Remember, it’s all about taking it one step at a time!

Consultant: Hello, Yueyue! I'm glad to see you again today. Let's chat about how you've been feeling recently, especially regarding kindergarten and the community activities you've been involved in. What’s on your mind?

User: Hi! I still feel a bit scared about going to kindergarten. But I had fun at the community activities. I want to feel less worried and more comfortable at school.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you enjoyed the community activities! It seems like you’re showing interest in new experiences, which is wonderful. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel scared about kindergarten?

User: Sometimes, it feels too loud and I don’t know what to do when I get there. I miss my mom when she leaves me.

Consultant: That feeling is very understandable, especially when you're in a new and loud place. Missing your mom is natural. When you think about going into kindergarten, what thoughts come to your mind that make you feel anxious?

User: I think that I might get lost or that nobody will talk to me. I don’t like it when I’m alone.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely be scary. It sounds like you fear being alone in a big place. What would happen if you tried to talk to someone at kindergarten? How do you think that might make you feel?

User: I don’t know. I think it could be okay. But what if they don’t want to play with me?

Consultant: That’s a common worry too, but remember, many other kids feel just like you! They might also be looking for a friend. What if we thought of a few ways to start a conversation or play with them? What do you think would be fun to ask them?

User: Maybe I can ask them about their favorite games or if they want to play with my toys?

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Asking about a game can be a great way to start talking. If you try that and they respond positively, how might that change how you feel about going to kindergarten?

User: It might make me feel less scared... like I have someone to play with.

Consultant: Exactly! Making connections can really help ease those scary feelings. Let’s think about some of the community activities you enjoyed. How can we incorporate those experiences into your time at kindergarten?

User: Maybe I can think of the activities we did in the community, like playing together. That might help!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remembering those fun moments can give you strength. How about we plan to talk to just one child next time at kindergarten? Just saying “hi” can be a great start. 

User: Okay, I think I can try that. Just saying "hi" seems easier!

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, Yueyue! And if you get nervous, you can take a deep breath and remind yourself of the fun times in the community. What else can help you feel more prepared before going to kindergarten?

User: I think I should practice saying "hi" and playing with my toys at home more. 

Consultant: Practicing at home is a brilliant idea! You can even pretend to invite a friend to play with you. How does that make you feel about trying it at school?

User: It makes me feel a little brave. 

Consultant: That's the spirit! Bravery comes in small steps, and you’re already taking some. How about we make a little plan for the next week? Maybe you can practice your greetings and play at home, and we can talk again about how it goes?

User: Yes! I want to tell you if it works!

Consultant: Perfect! I can't wait to hear about your experiences. Remember, it's okay to feel scared sometimes, but with little steps, you can become more comfortable. You’re doing an amazing job, Yueyue!

User: Thank you! I feel better just talking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, let’s recap—you're going to practice saying "hi," think of fun games to talk about, and remember your community experiences. Sound good? 

User: Yes, it sounds good!

Consultant: Wonderful! You have the tools you need to help yourself feel better. I’m proud of you for making these steps. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. I’m here for you!

User: I will remember! Thank you for helping me feel less scared.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yueyue! I'm excited for our next session to hear how it all goes. You’re showing so much courage! Take care until then!

User: Bye! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm really happy to see you today. How has everything been going with you and your daughter, Yueyue, since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, things have been improving a bit. Yueyue has started to try being more independent at home with some of her tasks. But she still gets really upset about going to kindergarten.

Consultant: That's great to hear that she's trying to be more independent! It's understandable that she still feels upset about kindergarten. Can you share what specific tasks she is handling at home? 

User: She's been trying to dress herself and even helped make her bed a couple of times. But when it comes to kindergarten, she just gets really anxious and cries.

Consultant: It sounds like she's making good progress with her independence at home, which is a positive step! Regarding kindergarten, what do you think makes her feel anxious or upset about it?

User: I think she's scared of being away from me. She always says she doesn’t want me to leave her there. 

Consultant: That’s very common for young children, especially when they're still adapting. Can you recall any moments when she had a good experience at kindergarten, even if just for a short time?

User: Yes, when I was able to stay with her for a little while, she played with some toys and seemed to have fun. But as soon as I had to leave, she got really upset.

Consultant: So there was a moment of happiness when you were there! That’s a great starting point. How do you think you could gradually help her feel more comfortable being there, perhaps by extending the time little by little? 

User: Maybe I could try to stay a bit longer each day until she feels okay to stay by herself? 

Consultant: That sounds like a very thoughtful approach! Gradually increasing your time there could help her build trust and comfort with the environment. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel hopeful about it. I just want her to feel safe and happy when she's there.

Consultant: Your willingness to support her is wonderful! In the coming days, as you implement this plan, it might also help to talk with her about her feelings and comfort level. Have you thought about how she might express her feelings about kindergarten?

User: She usually just cries when I mention it. But sometimes she talks a bit about her friends. 

Consultant: That’s a good sign! She does have some connections in that environment. Maybe asking her what she likes or what games she enjoys with her friends can help her focus on the positive experiences. How do you feel about having those conversations with her?

User: I think that would be nice, but I’m not sure how to approach it without making her upset.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel uncertain. You can start gently by sharing your observations, like, "I noticed you enjoyed playing with your friends last time. What was fun about it?" This way, you're opening the floor for her to share without pressure. 

User: I’ll definitely try that! It’s just hard to get her to talk sometimes.

Consultant: That's completely normal at her age. Sometimes expressiveness develops over time. Ensuring she knows she’s safe and supported can encourage her to share more. You'll be there to listen when she’s ready, right?

User: Yes, I’ll keep reminding her that I'm there for her. 

Consultant: That consistency will be beneficial! As you help her with these tasks at home, is there a specific activity that excites her and promotes her independence? 

User: She seems to like helping with cooking. Maybe we could try more cooking together!

Consultant: Cooking can be a fantastic way for her to feel accomplished and independent. How about setting aside regular times for this? It might help her build confidence and create positive memories with you that she can carry into kindergarten.

User: I love that idea! We could even talk about different foods and snacks she can try.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging her in the cooking process might help redirect her focus from anxiety. Additionally, perhaps you could involve her in planning simple snacks for school.

User: Yes! That might motivate her to look forward to going to kindergarten.

Consultant: Exactly! Encouraging her to participate in decision-making can enhance her confidence. Plus, it builds anticipation and excitement. How are you feeling about these strategies so far?

User: I feel good! It gives me hope seeing a plan we can work on together.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, the goal is a step-by-step journey. In our next session, we can discuss how these plans worked and any adjustments needed. 

User: Sounds great! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Enjoy your time cooking and chatting with Yueyue. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Yueyue! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling in kindergarten lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I actually joined some activities and had fun with my friends.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging in activities and having fun with friends is a big step. Can you tell me more about what activities you enjoyed the most?

User: I really liked playing with the blocks and drawing pictures. Sometimes I'd even share my drawings with the teacher.

Consultant: Sharing your drawings with the teacher is a fantastic way to connect! How did it make you feel to share your work with her?

User: It made me feel happy and proud. I liked when she praised my drawing.

Consultant: It's great to hear that! Feeling proud can really boost your confidence. Have you noticed how your classmates reacted when you shared your drawing?

User: Yes! They smiled and said they liked it too. I felt like I belonged when they did that.

Consultant: That sense of belonging is so important. It sounds like you're building friendships in kindergarten. How do you feel about your classmates now?

User: I feel happier with them now. I want to play more with them during games.

Consultant: That's a lovely feeling! Wanting to play more shows that you’re really connecting with them. What games do you think you might want to play together?

User: Maybe tag or hide and seek! I like running around with them.

Consultant: Those are such fun games! They really help you bond with your friends. Have there been times when you still feel a bit shy or scared about playing with them?

User: Sometimes. If I have to leave my mom, I feel scared again.

Consultant: It's normal to feel scared sometimes. Let's talk about how we can make those feelings smaller. What do you think might help you feel less scared when you’re at kindergarten?

User: Maybe if I think of happy things when I'm feeling scared, like playing.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Thinking about happy moments can help calm those scary feelings. Where do you see yourself playing happily when you think of those good moments?

User: I can see us playing in the big playground, laughing and running.

Consultant: Imagining that happy scene can really bring out good feelings! What about when you miss your mom? Is there something we can think of that helps you feel connected to her, even when she's not there?

User: I could remember her smile and that she loves me a lot.

Consultant: That's a beautiful thought! Keeping your mom's love in your heart can help you feel safe. How do you think this could help when you're at school?

User: Maybe I won't feel so alone, and I can focus on my games and friends more.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your friends and fun activities can help you feel less alone. Do you think you could try this next time you're at school?

User: Yes! I’ll remember her smile and think of my friends.

Consultant: That's a great plan, Yueyue! You're making wonderful progress. Let’s keep working on how to strengthen your friendships. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I want to be brave and play with them all the time.

Consultant: I believe in you being brave! It’s amazing to see your growth in kindergarten. Remember, each time you connect with your friends, you're building a strong friendship. How do you feel about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel happy and excited to try! 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about taking small steps. You're doing so well, and I'm proud of you. We can continue to explore these feelings and experiences in our next session. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes! I'm looking forward to it!

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m really happy with the progress you’ve made in understanding your feelings and building your friendships. Keep remembering your happy thoughts, and I look forward to hearing more about your adventures next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm so happy to see you today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling lately, especially in relation to your experiences at kindergarten.

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better since I made some friends at school, but sometimes I still get really upset when my mom leaves.

Consultant: It's good to hear that you've made friends! That must feel nice. You mentioned feeling upset when your mom leaves. Can you share a bit more about those feelings? 

User: Well, sometimes I just want her to stay with me. When she's not there, I feel all alone and scared. 

Consultant: Feeling alone and scared when your mom leaves is completely understandable. You’re developing new friendships, but those feelings still come up. Have you noticed any specific times when you feel this way? 

User: Yes, especially in the mornings when I have to say goodbye. I wish I could just bring her with me. 

Consultant: That sounds tough. Saying goodbye can be hard, especially when you want to feel secure. What do you think would help you feel a little better when you have to say goodbye?

User: Maybe if I knew I could play with my friends right away, it would help me feel better. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Knowing that you’ll have fun with your friends could make those goodbyes easier. Can we think of a way to remind you of your friends when you say goodbye?

User: Maybe I can think about what games we’ll play when I get to school? That might help!

Consultant: Great! Remembering the fun you’ll have can be really comforting. How are you feeling about your friendships at school now?

Consultant: It’s natural to have some worries, especially when things are new. Let’s talk about those worries—what specifically do you worry about?

User: I’m afraid they won’t want to play with me sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but it’s important to remember that friends enjoy playing with you. Have you seen anything that makes you feel loved or included during playtime? 

User: Yes! When we play together, they laugh and share their toys. That makes me really happy. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Laughing and sharing show that your friends enjoy being around you. You bring joy to playtime. How does it feel to know that your friends appreciate you? 

User: It feels really nice! But I still get scared when my mom leaves. 

Consultant: Those feelings can still be strong. But knowing you have friends to go to can help. Let’s practice something for when you start feeling scared. How about thinking of something comforting your mom says to you? 

User: Yes! She always tells me that she loves me and will be back soon.

Consultant: That’s perfect! You can hold onto that thought when you're feeling scared. It’s a way to feel connected to her even when she’s not there. How do you think that would work for you?
