Consultant: Hello, Chen. Welcome back to our session. I remember that last time, we talked about some of the challenges you're facing, especially regarding recognition and interpersonal relationships. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel quite frustrated. Ever since I lost my position as班长, I've been struggling with my self-worth. It seems like no one sees my efforts, especially at home. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Losing a position of responsibility can make you feel overlooked. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been bothering you in your family interactions?

User: Well, I try to help out as much as I can, but my efforts often go unnoticed. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm doing everything for them, but they don’t acknowledge it. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort but aren't getting the recognition you deserve. How does that make you feel when your contributions are overlooked?

User: It makes me feel angry and unappreciated. I work hard and it feels like no one cares. 

Consultant: Anger and feeling unappreciated are powerful emotions. Let’s explore the thoughts that accompany these feelings. When you feel this way, what thoughts go through your mind about your self-worth?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough. If I were better, maybe they would appreciate me more.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought. It seems like you’ve linked your self-worth to the recognition you receive from others. How do you think that impacts your interactions with your family?

User: It makes me more defensive and sometimes I snap at them. I don’t want to come off that way, but my emotions get the better of me. 

Consultant: It’s understandable. When you're feeling unacknowledged, it can lead to defensive reactions. What if we worked together to identify another way to view your self-worth that doesn’t rely solely on external validation? 

User: I guess that could help. I just don’t know how to change that thought.

Consultant: One approach could be to recognize and celebrate your efforts internally. Can you think of positive things about yourself or your contributions, regardless of whether others acknowledge them? 

User: I suppose I am always there for my daughter and I try to take care of my mom. Those are important things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are significant contributions. Let’s build on that. Every time you feel overlooked, could you remind yourself of those actions and their value? 

User: That makes sense. It’s just hard to remember in the moment.

Consultant: It is challenging, but we can work on strategies to help you remember. Would you be open to setting reminders or journaling your positive actions to look back on them when you’re feeling low?

User: Yeah, I think that could be a good idea. It might help destress me a bit.

Consultant: Great! This is a step towards recognizing your value. Let’s also think about ways to communicate your feelings with your family. How might you express your need for acknowledgment in a calm manner?

User: I could try talking to them directly, but I’m worried it will turn into an argument.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We can role-play that conversation. How about starting with “I feel” statements to express your feelings instead of blaming others? 

User: Okay. Like, “I feel unappreciated when my efforts aren't recognized?” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great start. How do you think your family would respond to hearing you express it that way?

User: Maybe they would be more understanding. They might not realize how I feel.

Consultant: Yes, giving them insight into your feelings could foster understanding. Let’s practice this. How would you feel after sharing that with them?

User: I think it would be a relief. Even if they don't react the way I hope, at least I’ll have said something.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset. It’s all about opening the door to communication and expressing what you need. Would you like to set a goal for practicing this communication in the coming week?

User: Yes, I’ll try to talk to them about it. Maybe during dinner, it feels casual.

Consultant: That sounds like a suitable environment for a heart-to-heart. Remember to focus on your feelings and be open. How do you anticipate feeling after this conversation?

User: Hopefully, I’ll feel heard. I guess it could help reduce my frustration.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook. With each step you take, you’re investing in improving your relationship and self-worth. Let’s check in next week about how it goes, alright?

User: Sure, I’m looking forward to it. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome, Chen. Remember, it's a process, and you're taking significant steps forward. Take care, and we'll talk again soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, could you share a bit about what’s been on your mind recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really angry and frustrated lately. It's mainly because of the conflicts I have with my ex-wife regarding our daughter’s custody. I feel like my efforts are never acknowledged.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's understandable to feel that way in such a challenging situation. Can you tell me more about what kinds of conflicts you've been facing?

User: Well, every time we discuss our daughter, it turns into an argument. I feel like she dismisses my opinions. It makes me feel powerless because I just want the best for our child.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It must be painful to feel ignored and unappreciated, especially when you're trying to communicate about something so important. How does this affect your emotions during these discussions?

User: I get really upset, and then I feel guilty afterward because I can’t control my anger. I don’t want to be that way, especially in front of my daughter.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize how your reactions might affect your daughter. Let’s explore your feelings of anger and guilt a bit more. When you feel that anger rising during these discussions, what specific thoughts run through your mind?

User: I usually think that I’m being treated unfairly and that no one understands the effort I’ve put in. It’s frustrating, and I keep replaying those thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of feeling unfairly treated and replaying those thoughts. This can heighten your emotions. Have you considered how you might challenge those thoughts during conflicts?

User: I haven’t really thought about it that way. I just react without really analyzing what I’m feeling at that moment.

Consultant: Recognizing the pattern is an important step. Let’s think about rephrasing those negative thoughts. Instead of focusing on how unfairly you are treated, what might you say to yourself to help alter that perspective?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's about our daughter’s well-being, not just me feeling wronged. But it’s hard when emotions are high.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to struggle with this in the heat of the moment. We can work on strategies to help you pause, reflect, and respond more calmly. Have you ever tried any techniques for cooling down your emotions before responding?

User: Not really. I just dive into the argument without thinking. 

Consultant: That’s very common. Perhaps we can explore some calming techniques together. For instance, taking deep breaths or stepping away for a moment to gather your thoughts before responding. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think I could try taking a break to breathe and clear my head if things get too heated.

Consultant: Great! It's a crucial step to help manage those immediate reactions. Now, let’s consider how you might prepare for these discussions with your ex-wife. What could you do differently before the conversation starts?

User: I could set my intentions, maybe write down what I want to communicate clearly, and even think about how to express my feelings without sounding accusatory.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. Communicating your intentions and focusing on “I” statements, like “I feel…” or “I need…”, instead of blaming can make a big difference. Have you tried that before?

User: No, I usually just express it all in the heat of the moment, which ends up escalating things instead.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing how expressing yourself differently could lead to more productive conversations. What might be the first step you take next time you communicate with her?

User: I’ll try to take a moment to breathe and then express how I feel about our daughter’s needs calmly, using those “I” statements.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive plan. It may take some practice, but you’re already on the right path. As we progress, we can role-play some of these scenarios. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could be helpful. Practicing beforehand might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can enhance your confidence and ability to communicate effectively. Let’s continue working on that. How have you been feeling about your overall situation lately?

User: Honestly, I still feel quite down and doubtful about myself. Sometimes, I just wonder whether I’m capable of managing all of this effectively.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially considering the strains you're facing. We’ll work through this together. Remember that self-doubt is normal, but focusing on small steps can help build your confidence.

User: That makes sense. I didn’t think of it that way. I guess it’s just difficult to see progress when things feel so overwhelming.

Consultant: It is indeed overwhelming at times. Let’s take a moment to reflect on your strengths. What abilities or characteristics do you possess that can help you navigate these challenges?

User: I suppose I’m really determined. I want to be a good father and do what’s best for my daughter. 

Consultant: That determination is a powerful asset and can guide you through tough times. Keeping that in mind can help you when doubt creeps in. What’s one small goal you can set for yourself this week to enhance your communication skills?

User: I could try to have a planned discussion with my ex about our daughter’s routine without diving into any conflicts. Just focus on listening to her as well.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Listening is such a crucial part of effective communication. As you prepare for this conversation, remember that focusing on your intentions can make a significant difference. 

User: Thank you for the encouragement. I’ll try to stay calm and focused on our daughter’s best interests.

Consultant: You’re doing great, and I believe in your ability to implement these changes. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what strategies we've discussed that you plan to use.

User: I’ll use calming techniques, prepare my thoughts, and practice expressing myself using “I” statements to foster better communication with my ex.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies to put into action. Don’t forget to be patient with yourself as you work on these changes. Remember, progress takes time. 

User: I really appreciate your support. I feel a bit more hopeful about handling these conversations better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! If you ever feel overwhelmed again, just remind yourself of these tools. I'll be here to support you in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more prepared to face things now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Chen! Looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling low and uncertain about your future. Can you share more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down about myself, especially after trying to find a job. I've had several interviews, but each time I come out feeling defeated and questioning my abilities.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel disheartened after repeated setbacks. Can you tell me about the thoughts that go through your mind after these interviews? 

User: After an interview, I often think that I'm not good enough. I just feel like I'm failing and that I’ll never find a job. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite harsh. When you think “I’m not good enough,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and really sad. I start to doubt whether I have any skills at all.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel anxious and sad. It's a difficult cycle to be in. Have you noticed if those thoughts are based on specific evidence or past experiences?

User: I guess it's based on my past failures, like being unable to hold down a job before. It all just feels connected.

Consultant: That connection makes sense. It’s important to remember that our past doesn’t define our future. What might be an alternate thought you could consider after an interview that isn’t as harsh as “not good enough”?

User: Maybe something like “I didn’t get this one, but it doesn’t mean I won’t get another opportunity.” But it's hard to believe that sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! It's a lot more forgiving. Let’s explore how we can help you believe that more. For instance, how might you feel if you approached the next interview with that mindset?

User: I suppose I would feel a bit lighter. Maybe I wouldn’t put so much pressure on myself.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like freeing yourself from that pressure could help you be more present in those moments. What actions do you think you could take to reinforce that lighter mindset before the next interview?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of my strengths right beforehand, or even take some deep breaths to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing self-reassurance and managing anxiety can definitely help. How about setting a small goal for your next interview? Something achievable?

User: Yes, I could aim to focus on what I can offer rather than on the outcome. 

Consultant: That’s a constructive goal, and focusing on your strengths can shift your mindset a lot. Let’s visualize how that interview could play out. What would you be feeling and doing differently?

User: I see myself being relaxed and confident, speaking about my experiences without the fear of judgment.

Consultant: That’s a strong visualization! I can tell that thinking about being confident makes you feel more empowered. Besides interviews, are there any activities you enjoy or that make you feel good about yourself?

User: I used to enjoy painting and spending time outdoors. I think those could help me feel better.

Consultant: Absolutely, engaging in activities you love can lift your mood and help ease anxiety. How about we set a goal for you to include some painting or outdoor time into your week?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’ll try to spend at least a few hours painting this week.

Consultant: Great! That’s a wonderful start. As you continue to create and spend time outdoors, pay attention to how it affects your mood. Let’s also talk about how you can track your feelings during this time of job searching. Would journaling be something you’d be open to trying?

User: I’ve never really journaled before, but I’m willing to give it a shot. It might help to get my thoughts out of my head. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Journaling can be a fantastic way to process emotions and reflect on your experiences. You could write about your feelings after interviews, your successes, and moments you feel confident. 

User: I like that idea. It might help me see patterns in my thinking.

Consultant: Exactly! Crucially, recognizing patterns can empower you to challenge negative beliefs over time. As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I feel like I have a clearer understanding of my thoughts and how to challenge them. I also have some practical steps to take.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re ready to take active steps towards feeling better about this job search. Remember, we’ll continue to build on these skills in future sessions. I believe you can find a path that fits you well.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about things now.

Consultant: You’re welcome. I’m glad to hear that. Keep nurturing that hope, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my future and new ideas for starting a business. It feels exciting but also overwhelming at times.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling excited about new possibilities! It's normal to feel overwhelmed when thinking about big changes. Can you share more about what's been on your mind regarding these ideas?

User: Well, I have this urge to do something meaningful with my life, but I'm not sure where to start. It's like I have all these ideas but no clear path forward.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling a mix of excitement and uncertainty. It can be helpful to identify those ideas and clarify what truly matters to you. What interests you the most about starting a business?

User: I think I want to create something that helps others, maybe something related to wellness or support for people in recovery. But I’m also afraid of failing.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a genuine desire to make a positive impact, which is wonderful! However, fear of failure can hold you back. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about failing?

User: I worry that I might invest time and effort into something that won't succeed. I have this fear of letting myself and others down again.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have these fears, especially given your past experiences. Let's explore that fear a bit more. What evidence do you have that suggests your ideas might not succeed?

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence. It's just a feeling I have. I’ve tried things before and didn’t get the results I wanted.

Consultant: Acknowledging that feeling is a good start. It’s based on past experiences, but that doesn’t define your future potential. What if we looked at one of your ideas more critically? What could be a small step to take towards it?

User: I could perhaps start by researching some business models and seeing what others have done. It wouldn’t feel so scary if I make it a small step.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Breaking it down into smaller steps can certainly make it less overwhelming. How would you feel about setting a specific goal for research this week?

User: I think making a plan for research this week could help. Maybe I can allocate certain hours to do it each day.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Structuring your time can create a sense of accomplishment and progress. What do you think would be a realistic time commitment for you?

User: I think I could manage about an hour a day. I can write down what I find interesting.

Consultant: Perfect! Allocating an hour each day sounds very achievable. Writing down your findings can help clarify your thoughts. How do you feel about this plan?

User: It feels good. A bit less intimidating than thinking about starting a whole business right away.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This structured approach can keep your motivation up. Remember, progress is often made through small, consistent steps. What would you like to focus on next during our session today?

User: I’d like to explore more about my emotions and how to manage them better. Sometimes I feel so unstable, especially when I encounter obstacles.

Consultant: Absolutely. Recognizing the need to manage your emotions is an important insight. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt your emotions were difficult to manage?

User: Recently, I had a disagreement with a friend about my ideas. It made me feel really anxious and unsure of myself.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Conflicts can heighten anxiety, especially when we're invested in our ideas. What thoughts were running through your mind during that disagreement?

User: I kept thinking that I must be wrong if someone else disagrees with me. It made me doubt my ideas completely.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a cycle of self-doubt. Let’s explore this. Is there evidence to support the idea that you're wrong simply because someone disagrees with you?

User: No, not really. I guess it’s just how I feel when I’m challenged.

Consultant: It’s common for our emotions to cloud our rational thinking. Perhaps we can work on recognizing when those thoughts arise and challenge them. How do you feel about practicing this the next time you experience self-doubt?

User: I’d like to try that. I think having a way to counter those thoughts could help.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! We can create a strategy for you. When you notice self-doubt creeping in, you can remind yourself of your value and that differing opinions do not invalidate your perspectives. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I think that would help a lot.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s summarize your goals for today: You’re going to begin your research for your business ideas, set aside an hour each day, and work on challenging self-doubt as it arises. 

User: That sounds perfect. I'm feeling much more hopeful after discussing this today.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Growth often comes from taking intentional steps, and your willingness to reflect is commendable. As we wrap up, what would you like to take away from today’s session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can break things down and that my feelings don’t have to dictate my choices.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing about your steps next time. Keep believing in yourself, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to reflect more on myself, especially after that workshop. It's been somewhat helpful, but I still feel a bit unstable at times.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're focusing on self-reflection. It can be a powerful tool. Can you share more about the ups and downs you've been experiencing?

User: Well, there are moments when I feel okay, and I think I'm making progress. But then I have these sudden feelings of anxiety, especially when I think about my future, work, and my relationship with my daughter.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s understandable to feel anxious when thinking about significant aspects of your life. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel anxious about your future or your relationship?

User: I often think that I’m not doing enough or that I might fail. Sometimes I worry about not being a good father because of my past.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of pressure for you. Can we explore how those thoughts impact your feelings and actions? How do you feel when you think that you're not doing enough?

User: I feel overwhelmed and defeated. It makes me want to avoid situations where I might fail, which doesn't help my relationship with my daughter or my overall life.

Consultant: Avoidance can often work against us, especially when it comes to nurturing relationships. What do you think would happen if you faced those feelings head-on instead of avoiding them?

User: I guess I might realize that things aren't as bad as I think, and I could take steps towards improving my situation.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. Let’s work on challenging those thoughts of inadequacy. When you think, "I’m not doing enough," what evidence do you have to support that thought? And is there any counter-evidence?

User: I don’t know... I sometimes help my daughter with her homework and try to be there for her. So, maybe that shows I’m trying.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those actions show that you are present and engaged. It sounds like there’s evidence that contradicts the belief you're not doing enough. How can you remind yourself of these positive actions in moments of doubt?

User: I could write them down or maybe remind myself of them when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keeping a list of your accomplishments can serve as a reminder of your efforts. Let’s think about another area—what activities bring you joy and help you feel more grounded?

User: I enjoy going for walks and listening to music. Those moments help me relax.

Consultant: Wonderful! It might be beneficial to incorporate more of those activities into your routine. They can serve as a practical tool for managing your emotions. How do you feel about scheduling regular time for these activities?

User: That sounds good. I could try to go for a walk a few times a week.

Consultant: Excellent plan! That can help build emotional stability and provide space for reflection. Now, let’s discuss your social support. How are your relationships with friends or family currently?

User: I don’t have many close friends, to be honest. It’s hard for me to connect with others since my past has made me cautious.

Consultant: I can understand that. Building social connections can feel daunting, especially after experiencing difficulties. What do you think might help you feel more comfortable reaching out to others?

User: Maybe if I find people who understand what I’ve been through, I could open up more.

Consultant: Seeking understanding and supportive connections is so important. Would you be open to exploring ways to meet people who share similar experiences or interests?

User: Yes, I've thought about joining some groups or classes, but I haven't taken the step yet.

Consultant: That could be a wonderful opportunity for you! It might help you build connections while cultivating new skills and interests. How about setting a small goal to explore some options this week?

User: I could check out a local group. That would be a good start.

Consultant: Great idea! Taking that initial step can open up doors for new interactions. Lastly, as we begin to wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What do you feel was most helpful for you in this session?

User: I liked the idea of challenging my negative thoughts and recognizing my efforts. It feels good to have some strategies to manage my anxiety and emotions.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing your efforts and challenging negative thoughts are powerful tools. As you continue on this journey, remember to be kind to yourself. Let’s plan to review your progress and the strategies we've talked about in our next session. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good. I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to our next session as well! You're making great strides, and I believe in your capacity for growth. Remember, you have support here whenever you need it. Take care, Chen!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk? 

User: Hi, I feel a bit better overall. I've been attending the community rehabilitation activities regularly, and I think being around others helps. But sometimes, I still doubt myself.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're participating in community activities, which can indeed provide a supportive environment. When you mention self-doubt, can you share what specifically triggers those feelings?

User: Sometimes, I worry about finding a stable job and being a good father. I just want to provide for my daughter and be there for her.

Consultant: Those are significant concerns, and it's understandable to feel pressure in those areas. How do those worries affect your day-to-day life and your participation in community activities?

User: They often make me feel anxious. I get distracted and sometimes avoid socializing because I feel inadequate. 

Consultant: It sounds like your self-doubts lead to avoidance, which can be quite challenging. Can we explore the thoughts that come to your mind when you feel inadequate or anxious? What do you usually think in those moments?

User: I often think that I'll never find a job or that my daughter will be disappointed in me. It's like a loop that keeps playing in my head.

Consultant: I see. Those repetitive thoughts can indeed be overwhelming. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts. On a scale of 1 to 10, how true do you think those thoughts are, and is there evidence supporting them?

User: I guess I would rate them about a 7. There's some truth to feeling lost, but I did get good feedback from the community team. 

Consultant: It's important that you recognize the positives too. You’ve received feedback affirming your contributions. What alternative thoughts could you tell yourself that reflect a more balanced view of your situation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I'm still trying and that being involved is progress. I shouldn’t judge my entire future based on my current struggles. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful alternative! Acknowledging your current efforts rather than solely focusing on the outcomes is essential. How does it feel to think of your situation this way?

User: It feels better, less heavy. I think I can allow myself some grace to learn and improve.

Consultant: Absolutely, Chen! Allowing yourself that grace is a vital step in your journey. How can we integrate this approach into your daily routine, such as during moments of doubt?

User: I could write down those alternative thoughts and maybe practice saying them to myself when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Writing them down can help solidify those positive thoughts. Could we also brainstorm ways to keep engaging with the community that makes you feel appreciated and connected?

User: Yes, I think I’d like to lead a small group activity sometime. It would help me take on responsibility and boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Leading an activity can enhance your sense of purpose and involvement. What type of activity do you think you might want to lead?

User: Maybe something fun for the kids and parents together. I feel good when I see them enjoy themselves.

Consultant: What a wonderful initiative! Organizing an enjoyable event could strengthen your community ties and bring joy to both you and the participants. What steps do you think you need to take to start planning this?

User: I’ll need to discuss it with the community organizers and see what resources we have. I should reach out to them soon.

Consultant: Great plan! Communicating with the organizers will help you gain clarity and support for your idea. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous. But I think that’s normal.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when venturing into new responsibilities. It's a sign that you are stepping out of your comfort zone, which can lead to growth. How do you think you can manage that nervousness when approaching the organizers?

User: I could remind myself that they are supportive and want to help me succeed. 

Consultant: That's a very constructive strategy! Holding onto that supportive perspective can empower you as you reach out. How do you feel about our discussions today as we wrap up?

User: I feel more hopeful and motivated. Today's conversation really helped clarify my thoughts. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Chen! Let’s summarize your progress today: you’ve acknowledged your strengths in community involvement, identified alternative thoughts, and taken steps towards a community activity. What will be your next steps moving forward?

User: I’ll focus on planning the activity and using those alternative thoughts to counter my self-doubt.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe in your ability to move forward with this. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. If you find any challenges along the way, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I truly appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Chen! I'm here for you. We'll close this session today, but I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next meeting. Take care and keep engaging with your community!

User: I will! Thanks again, and see you next time!
