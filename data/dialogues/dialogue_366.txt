Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down. Work has been tough, and my project didn't go well. I'm doubting my abilities, and things with my girlfriend are not great either. We seem to argue all the time.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that things have been difficult. It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed with both work and your relationship. Can you tell me a bit more about how these experiences have impacted your feelings about your life overall?

User: I just feel lost. There's this emptiness, and I can't find any motivation to do anything. Even when I hang out with friends or family, I still feel isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling isolated even when you have support around you. Let's explore this emptiness a bit more. What do you believe is at the root of these feelings?

User: I think it’s the pressure at work. I put a lot of my self-worth into my job, and when I fail, it feels like I fail as a person. Plus, my relationship issues just add to it all.

Consultant: It makes sense that work pressures and relationship struggles would contribute to feelings of worthlessness. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you experience failure at work?

User: I often think that I’m just not cut out for this job, or that everyone else is better than me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh and negative. What emotions do these thoughts stir within you when they arise?

User: They make me feel anxious, and I start to doubt if I can even do my job properly.

Consultant: Anxiety and self-doubt can be very consuming. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you aren’t capable in your job?

User: I mean, I’ve had successes before, and colleagues often say I do well... but I can’t help but remember the failure.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a mix of experiences. Focusing on just the negative can skew your view. What if you looked at a time in the past where you were successful—how did that make you feel?

User: I felt accomplished and confident, but it’s hard to feel that way now.

Consultant: I understand it feels hard right now, but carrying those successful feelings can provide a helpful perspective. How do you think you can begin to shift your focus back toward those positive experiences?

User: I guess I could try reminding myself of my successful projects and how I overcame challenges before.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step forward! Reinforcing those positive memories might help build your confidence. Now, regarding your relationship with your girlfriend, what thoughts come to mind when you argue with her?

User: I often think that we’ll never find a solution and that maybe it’s better to just give up.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought. It reflects a sense of hopelessness. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the notion that there’s no way to resolve your issues?

User: There have been good moments, but they feel so distant now.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when things are tough. Let’s consider those good moments as possibilities for rebuilding. What small steps do you think you could take to start improving communication with her?

User: Maybe I could start by listening more and not jumping to conclusions during our fights.

Consultant: That's a very constructive approach! Active listening can create a more open dialogue. How would you feel about suggesting a calm time for both of you to discuss your feelings?

User: That sounds good. I just hope we can actually have a positive conversation.

Consultant: Hope is important! Planning for a calm conversation could facilitate a better outcome. After our session today, how do you feel about the progress we’re making toward understanding your emotions and seeking a renewed sense of purpose?

User: I feel a bit relieved to talk about these issues, but I’m still anxious about how to follow through.

Consultant: It's okay to feel anxious about change. It’s part of the process. Remember, taking small steps and being gentle with yourself can lead to meaningful changes over time. What’s one small task you can commit to this week to start this journey?

User: I think I can write down my positive experiences from work and plan a time to talk with my girlfriend.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Reflecting on positive experiences can be uplifting, and engaging in a conversation with your girlfriend shows you're taking proactive steps. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind?

User: Just feeling a bit uncertain about the future, but I guess that’s normal.

Consultant: Feeling uncertain is indeed a normal part of this process. Embracing that uncertainty while you navigate changes can help you find your path forward. Thank you for sharing today, Zhang Wei. Remember, you have the tools to foster change and keep moving forward. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself along the way.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you today. I understand you're feeling a bit uncertain about the future and facing some difficulties. Can you share more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've been really struggling with my job lately. The project I'm working on is not progressing well, and it's seriously affecting my confidence. I just feel so lost and unmotivated.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed with your work situation, which is impacting your self-esteem and motivation. Could you tell me more about how this feels for you on a daily basis?

User: It feels like I'm constantly under pressure, and I can't seem to make any progress. I fear that I’m not capable enough to handle my responsibilities, and this thought just keeps nagging at me.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It's understandable to feel pressured, especially when you doubt your abilities. When you think about these situations, what specific thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I start thinking that I'm not cut out for this job and that I'll never succeed. It makes me feel even more anxious, like I'm trapped in this cycle of negativity.

Consultant: That cycle of negative thinking can be really tough to break. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. How strongly do you believe in those thoughts when they come up? 

User: I guess I believe them quite a bit, at least 80% of the time. It's hard to shake them off, especially when I'm already feeling low.

Consultant: It makes sense that they feel very real in those moments. What would happen if you were to challenge those thoughts? Can you think of any evidence that suggests you are capable or have succeeded in the past?

User: I suppose I have completed projects before, and my boss has given me positive feedback occasionally. But it just feels like those moments are few and far between.

Consultant: You have valid reasons to recognize your capabilities based on past successes. What if we tried to focus on those strengths? How might shifting your perspective change how you approach your current project?

User: Maybe if I reminded myself of those achievements, I would feel less overwhelmed. But it’s just so hard to stop that negative thinking.

Consultant: It's definitely a process to shift your thinking patterns. We could practice identifying those negative thoughts and substituting them with more balanced or positive ones. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Sure, I think that might help. I just want to feel better about myself and my work.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by identifying a negative thought you're experiencing in your work right now. Can you share one?

User: I keep telling myself that I'm going to fail and disappoint my team.

Consultant: If you were to replace that thought with something more balanced, what could you say instead?

User: I could say that I'm doing my best and that everyone makes mistakes, but I can learn from them.

Consultant: That's a wonderful reframe! Acknowledging your efforts and the possibility of growth is powerful. Let’s practice that thought whenever you feel the anxiety creeping in. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit more reassuring. I think I can work with that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, shifting gears a little, how has the tension with your girlfriend been affecting you lately?

User: It's really hard. We argue a lot, and it just adds to my stress. I want to fix things, but I don’t know how to communicate without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: Communication can be a tricky aspect of relationships, especially when emotions are running high. What do you think usually triggers those arguments between you two?

User: I think it’s mostly about misunderstandings and both of us feeling frustrated with our own lives. We end up taking it out on each other.

Consultant: That’s common in relationships. It sounds like both of you are under pressure. What if we worked on some strategies to improve your communication? 

User: That would be really great. I just want to feel connected again.

Consultant: To start, one effective technique is to use “I” statements when expressing your feelings. Instead of saying, “You're always late,” try saying, “I feel anxious when our plans change last minute.” How do you think that would go over?

User: I think it could make things less accusatory, which might help ease the tension. I’ll definitely give it a shot.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward. Let’s also set a goal for you to share something kind or appreciative with her each day. It can help rebuild connections slowly. How does that sound? 

User: I like that idea. It seems manageable, and it should help her feel appreciated too.

Consultant: Absolutely! As we wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on the progress we’ve made. You’ve identified some strategies for your work challenges and ways to improve communication with your girlfriend. What do you feel your biggest takeaway is today?

User: I think recognizing my past successes and finding better ways to communicate. Those are really important.

Consultant: I’m glad you found those helpful! Moving forward, keep practicing those thoughts and communication techniques. You’ve got this, Zhang Wei! If you ever feel stuck again, remember that we can always work together on these challenges. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the guidance. I’ll definitely try to put these ideas into practice.

Consultant: You're welcome! I believe in your ability to create positive changes. I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better emotionally, but I still have uncertainties about the future of my relationship. My girlfriend and I have been trying to communicate more, but there are still arguments.

Consultant: It's good to hear that you're feeling some improvement. Let's explore that. What kind of communication strategies have you tried with your girlfriend recently?

User: We've started to talk about our feelings more openly, but sometimes it feels like we end up arguing instead of really understanding each other.

Consultant: That's understandable. Improving communication can be a challenge, especially when emotions run high. Can you share a specific example of a conversation that led to an argument recently?

User: There was a time when I tried to express my feelings about feeling unappreciated, but she thought I was blaming her, and it escalated from there.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It’s common for conversations about feelings to sometimes be misinterpreted. How did you feel during that argument?

User: I felt really hurt and misunderstood, and I think she felt defensive. It just spiraled out of control.

Consultant: I can see how distressing that must have been for both of you. In situations like this, focusing on expressing your feelings without placing blame can help. How comfortable would you feel trying “I” statements, like saying, "I feel unappreciated" instead of "You don't appreciate me"?

User: I think that's a good idea. I just get caught up in how I’m feeling and end up sounding accusatory.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It can be tough to navigate emotions in the moment. Would you like to practice using “I” statements together? We can role-play a situation if you're open to it.

User: Sure! I think that might help me get more comfortable with it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set the scene—imagine you’re in a conversation where you feel unappreciated. Go ahead and start with an “I” statement, and I’ll respond as your girlfriend.

User: Okay... "I feel unappreciated when you don’t acknowledge the things I do around the house." 

Consultant: I hear you saying that you feel unappreciated. What about that makes you feel this way? 

User: I guess I just feel like my efforts go unnoticed, and it would mean a lot if she recognized them.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let's work on how your girlfriend might respond. I might say, "I didn't realize you felt that way. Can you tell me more about what you do that you feel isn't acknowledged?" 

User: That sounds good. It definitely feels more open.

Consultant: Exactly! This approach can foster understanding rather than defensiveness. How does practicing this make you feel in terms of handling those tough conversations?

User: I feel a bit more confident, like I have a more constructive way to express myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Building this confidence in communication can really help ease the tension in your relationship. What other areas do you think could benefit from similar practices?

User: I think just expressing gratitude could also help, like noticing the little things she does.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Sometimes, expressing appreciation can create a positive atmosphere. How about we brainstorm some specific things you could express gratitude for?

User: Sure! Like thanking her for cooking dinner or just listening to me when I’m stressed.

Consultant: Excellent examples! These small gestures can really deepen your connection. How about setting a goal for yourself to express gratitude at least once a day?

User: I can definitely do that. It feels like a simple yet effective idea.

Consultant: Wonderful! By incorporating gratitude into your interactions, you'll likely see an improvement in your relationship dynamics over time. How has thinking about these strategies impacted your feelings about your relationship?

User: I feel hopeful actually. It seems like there are things I can do to change our communication for the better.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Hope is an essential part of building renewed motivation. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today regarding your relationship?

User: I think I’m good for now. I feel much more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, let’s recap what we’ve worked on. You’ve learned about using “I” statements and expressing gratitude, which should help improve your communication. How do you feel about these techniques going forward?

User: I feel positive. I actually want to try them out this week!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing these new strategies takes courage, and I believe you can make meaningful changes. If feelings become overwhelming, just remember to take a step back and breathe. 

User: I will! Thanks for your support and guidance.  

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Zhang Wei! It has been wonderful to witness your progress today. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session together. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. I've started to enjoy some new activities, and I'm trying to spend more quality time with my girlfriend. It feels like I'm finding more meaning in my life.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're beginning to embrace those new activities and experiencing positive changes. Can you tell me more about what specific activities you’ve been engaging in?

User: Sure! I recently picked up painting, and it really helps me to relax. I also tried going for walks in the park, which I find quite refreshing. Spending time with my girlfriend has also improved a bit, as we are trying to connect more.

Consultant: Painting and walking in the park sound like great ways to express yourself and connect with nature. It’s also encouraging to hear that you’re working on your relationship. How does engaging in these activities make you feel overall?

User: When I paint, I feel free and creative, like I can express my thoughts without pressure. Walking helps clear my mind, and I feel more relaxed afterwards. Spending time with my girlfriend feels less tense, and we laugh a bit more.

Consultant: It's fantastic that these activities bring you such joy and relaxation. That sense of freedom in painting is really valuable. How do you think continuing these activities can impact your overall sense of purpose and motivation moving forward?

User: I believe that as I keep painting and enjoying these moments, I might find a greater sense of purpose. It feels like I'm discovering who I am beyond my work, and that feels encouraging.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Zhang Wei! Finding your identity beyond work is crucial for well-being. What goals do you think you could set for yourself to further explore these new interests and maintain this positive momentum?

User: I’ve thought about setting a goal of completing one painting each week, and I also want to plan regular dates with my girlfriend to try new things together, like cooking or hiking.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Completing a painting each week gives you a creative outlet, and exploring activities together with your girlfriend can strengthen your bond. How do you feel about these goals? Are they motivating for you?

User: Yes, they seem doable and fun. The idea of creating something new each week excites me, and I think spending quality time with her could help ease any lingering tension in our relationship.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! It’s essential to focus on enjoyment while working toward your goals. Let’s also think about any challenges you might encounter as you pursue these new activities. What obstacles do you foresee, and how could you address them?

User: I worry that I might get too busy with work and neglect these activities. Sometimes, the stress can make it hard to stay motivated. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to be concerned about balancing work and personal interests. How about we brainstorm some strategies to prioritize these activities, even on busy days? 

User: Maybe I could schedule specific time blocks for painting and activities with my girlfriend, treating them like important appointments.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Scheduling them can certainly help ensure they remain a priority. How would you feel about committing to that schedule for this week?

User: I think I can commit to that! Having a structured plan might help keep me on track.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s touch base about how you feel about that schedule next time. In the meantime, how can I support you in maintaining your motivation for these activities?

User: I would appreciate it if you just check in with me about my progress during our sessions. That accountability would be really helpful.

Consultant: Of course! I’ll make sure to follow up on your progress. Remember, it’s all about having fun and exploring what makes you happy. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today regarding your new journey?

User: Not at the moment. I feel really good about what we talked about, and I’m excited to take on these goals.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling positive about this! It sounds like you're making great strides in finding meaning and joy in your life. Just a quick reminder: Keep being gentle with yourself on this journey. While you want to be proactive, it's also okay to take breaks when needed.

User: Absolutely! Thank you for reminding me of that. I’ll try to balance everything.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, progress is a journey, not a race. Take your time, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the wonderful work, Zhang Wei!

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it too! Have a wonderful week ahead, and take care!

User: You too! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately. What positive experiences have you had recently?

User: Hi! I feel much better than before. Recently, I’ve had some good interactions with my friends and even made some progress in repairing my relationship with my girlfriend. It's made me feel more alive!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! It seems like your relationships have positively impacted your mood. Can you share more about how those interactions influenced your feelings?

User: Sure! Spending time with friends helps me forget about stress at work. With my girlfriend, we talked things out and it felt like I could finally express my feelings. I think it brought us closer.

Consultant: It sounds like open communication has really benefited your relationship. How did you feel before these interactions?

User: I often felt isolated and unmotivated. I wasn’t sure what direction to take in my life, which made me anxious.

Consultant: I can imagine that feeling lost is very tough. It's great to see that you've made strides to overcome that. How do you view your self-worth now compared to before?

User: Honestly, it's improved a lot. I feel like my feelings and opinions matter now, especially in my relationships.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift. Let’s explore how you can maintain this positive mindset. What strategies have you been using to keep this forward momentum?

User: I’ve been trying to stay socially active and focus on what makes me happy. I also work out occasionally, which helps clear my mind.

Consultant: Staying active both socially and physically can be very beneficial! Have you noticed any specific moments or thoughts that help reinforce this positive state?

User: Yes, I made a list of things I’m grateful for, and it really helps to remind me of the good in my life.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic practice. Focusing on gratitude often helps foster a positive outlook. Let's build on that. How do you plan to handle moments when you might feel overwhelmed again?

User: I guess I’ll try to remember these positive experiences and reach out to friends or family when I feel down.

Consultant: Reaching out to your support network is an excellent strategy. It’s crucial to lean on those who can help you through tough times. What specific steps can you take to ensure those connections remain strong?

User: I want to schedule regular catch-ups with friends and make more effort to communicate with my girlfriend. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular communication is key to maintaining healthy relationships. Now, let’s think about preventing feelings of isolation. What activities could you include in your week to stay engaged?

User: I could join a hobby group or volunteer. I want to meet new people and still feel part of a community.

Consultant: Joining a group can enrich your social life and keep you active! Have you considered which hobbies you might want to explore? 

User: I've always wanted to try painting or photography. I think those could be fulfilling.

Consultant: Both painting and photography seem like wonderful creative outlets. They can also provide a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about incorporating these into your routine?

User: I feel excited! I think having an outlet will help me stay balanced emotionally.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Engaging in creative activities can be therapeutic. How often do you think you could allocate time for these hobbies?

User: Maybe on weekends or a couple of evenings during the week. I need that time to re-energize myself.

Consultant: Setting aside specific times for creative pursuits is a great idea. It’s important to prioritize self-care. How do you envision your week looking with these new activities?

User: I imagine feeling productive and happy, maybe sharing my creations with friends too. I think that’ll motivate me even more.

Consultant: Sharing your work with others can enhance your sense of community and joy in your pursuits. What other positive habits can you think of that could further support your emotional well-being?

User: I could start practicing mindfulness or meditation to help with stress relief.

Consultant: That’s an excellent addition! Mindfulness can help ground you and manage stress effectively. Have you tried any forms of mindfulness before?

User: I’ve read about it, but I haven’t actually tried it yet. I’m willing to give it a shot.

Consultant: Wonderful! There are many resources available to help you start. What would be a good time for you to integrate mindfulness practices into your routine?

User: Mornings seem best since I can start the day fresh and calm.

Consultant: Starting your day with mindfulness can set a positive tone for the rest of it. I encourage you to try this regularly. Now, let’s summarize what we’ve covered. What strategies are you most excited about implementing?

User: I'm really looking forward to my creative hobbies, regular connection with friends, and starting mindfulness practices!

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies to boost your emotional wellbeing! As we wrap up, remember that maintaining these positive changes is key. How do you plan to monitor your progress in the coming weeks?

User: I think I’ll keep a journal to track my feelings and experiences. This way, I can reflect on my progress regularly.

Consultant: A journal can be a powerful tool for reflection. It will help you stay aware of your emotions and how you are evolving. As our session comes to a close, I want you to know how proud I am of your progress. If challenges arise, you’re well-equipped to face them.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more optimistic about my future now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang Wei! Remember, you have the tools to continue this positive journey. Don’t hesitate to come back if you need further support. Take care!

###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing quite well, actually. After planning that short trip with my girlfriend, our relationship has really improved, and I feel happier overall.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that your relationship has taken a more positive turn. What aspects of the trip do you think contributed to that improvement?

User: I think just spending quality time together without distractions really helped us reconnect. We talked a lot and tried to understand each other's feelings better.

Consultant: It sounds like you both made a wonderful effort to communicate. How have those conversations affected your daily life since the trip?

User: I think being honest about my feelings and maybe scheduling a time to talk when we are both relaxed could help us. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Scheduling time for important discussions can create a safe space. Have you thought about setting any specific relationship goals for both of you?

User: Yes, I think we should aim to have regular check-ins, maybe weekly, just to see how we're doing and address any issues early.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea. Regular check-ins can help maintain emotional connection and prevent misunderstandings. How do you feel about your personal goals outside of your relationship?

User: I've been thinking more about what I want out of life in general lately. I feel like I need some direction.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Zhang Wei. Finding direction can often bring a newfound sense of purpose. What areas of your life are you considering focusing on for personal growth?

User: I want to develop my career further and maybe explore new hobbies or interests. I also think becoming more involved in my community might help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Focusing on your career and exploring new interests can provide you with fulfillment. What specific steps do you think you could take to pursue these goals?

User: I could start by taking a course related to my field and maybe volunteering on weekends. That would be a good way to explore new things while contributing to the community.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Learning and volunteering can definitely enhance your skills and social connections. How do you feel about your current motivation levels towards achieving these goals?

User: I feel motivated, especially now that I've been seeing positive changes in my life. I really want to keep that momentum going.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Maintaining that momentum is key. What strategies can you implement to stay motivated as you pursue these goals?

User: I could set smaller, manageable milestones and celebrate the achievements along the way. That would help me stay focused and motivated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking down your goals into smaller milestones is a great way to prevent feeling overwhelmed. What specific milestone do you want to focus on first?

User: I think starting the course should be my first milestone. If I can enroll within the next month, that would feel like a great start.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Setting a timeline can provide you with a clear path forward. How do you think achieving this milestone might affect your overall mindset?

User: I believe it would boost my confidence and make me feel more capable of taking on new challenges.

Consultant: I completely agree! Achieving that milestone can have a positive ripple effect on other aspects of your life. Is there anything else you would like to discuss or any concerns about your goals?

User: I guess I’m just concerned about balancing everything—my relationship, work, and personal growth. It feels like a lot sometimes.

Consultant: Balancing multiple priorities can indeed be challenging. Have you thought about how to manage your time effectively to accommodate all these important areas?

User: I might need to create a more structured schedule. Having designated time for each aspect of my life could help keep me on track.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy. A structured schedule can provide clarity and help prevent overwhelm. How does that approach sit with you?

User: It makes sense. I think I’ll feel more in control if I can visualize my time better. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Visualizing your time can definitely aid in managing your responsibilities. Perhaps we can touch on how to evaluate your progress as you implement these steps?

User: Sure! I could set aside time each month to reflect on what’s working and what isn’t. Adjusting as needed seems crucial.

Consultant: That's an excellent practice. Reflection and adjusting goals can help you stay aligned with your aspirations. Before we wrap up, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from today's session?

User: I believe the emphasis on communication, structured planning, and reflection stands out to me. It gives me a clearer path forward.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m glad you found our conversation valuable. You have a solid plan moving forward, and I’m here to support you in your journey. Are you feeling ready to take on these steps?

User: Yes, I’m excited about it! Thank you for the guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang Wei! Remember, you're in control, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
