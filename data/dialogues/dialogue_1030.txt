Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you could join me today. I want to hear about what you've been experiencing lately. How have things been for you?

User: Hi. Things have been really tough. My parents are constantly strict with me, and it's causing a lot of arguments. I feel like they just don’t understand me, and I’m also frustrated when my classmates aren’t friendly.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of tension between you and your parents and that it’s affecting how you feel at school too. Could you share a bit more about specific moments when you felt this way?

User: Whenever my parents tell me what to do or criticize me, I just feel this anger bubbling up inside. And at school, when classmates make fun of me or ignore me, it makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: I see. You're feeling a lot of anger and frustration both at home and with your classmates. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you tell me how these feelings impact your behavior, like what you might do when you feel this way?

User: When I’m angry, I tend to shut down and not talk to them. I just go to my room and stay away from everyone. But then I feel lonely, and it's like I'm stuck in a cycle.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling both angry and lonely at the same time. It’s important to break that cycle. What do you think would help you express those feelings instead of shutting down?

User: I don’t know. Maybe talking to my parents about how I feel? But I’m always afraid it won't change anything.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Communicating about emotions can be challenging, especially when you fear it won't lead to understanding. What if we could explore some ways to express yourself that might gradually help improve things with them?

User: That could be worth trying, but what if they just get defensive?

Consultant: It's a possibility, but we could work on how to approach the conversation; for instance, how to share your feelings without blaming them. Would you like to practice some phrases or ways to start that conversation?

User: Yeah, that would help. I just want them to see how strict they are, but I don’t want it to turn into another fight.

Consultant: Great. Let's think of it as sharing your perspective rather than accusing them. You might start with how their actions make you feel. For example, you could say, "I feel overwhelmed when you impose strict rules." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I just need to find the right moment to say it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Timing can be important. What do you think the right moment might look like?

User: Maybe when we’re all calm and not arguing? I need to pay attention to when they’re not in a bad mood.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Picking a calmer moment can help with a better conversation. How do you feel about practicing some more responses for when they push back or don’t understand?

User: I guess I could try that. It’s just hard because I feel so much pressure when I talk to them.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel pressured; it’s tough to discuss sensitive topics. We can also explore ways to manage that pressure. Would you feel comfortable sharing some strategies you could try if you feel overwhelmed in that moment?

User: I might take a deep breath or pause before responding. But sometimes, I just forget all that and react impulsively.

Consultant: Taking a deep breath is a fantastic strategy! It helps create space before you respond. If you find yourself forgetting, we could practice some reminders or cues when you feel that frustration building. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to remember not to explode when I’m angry.

Consultant: Absolutely, managing those impulses is key. Let’s also think about how you can express yourself in a way that can help you feel more in control. Would role-playing how that conversation could go be helpful for you?

User: Sure, role-playing might help. I’ve never really practiced talking to my parents like that.

Consultant: Let's start by envisioning a scenario where you talk to them. Picture yourself feeling calm and sharing your feelings. I’ll play your parents, and you can practice what you might say.

User: Okay! I’ll start by saying how their strictness makes me feel.

Consultant: Perfect! Go ahead when you're ready.

User: “Mom, Dad, I feel really overwhelmed by the rules you set for me…”

Consultant: That’s a solid start! Now imagine me responding, and you can practice handling that. What would make you feel satisfied with our discussion?

User: I’d want them to listen and maybe agree to talk about things. But I also expect them to get defensive!

Consultant: It’s reasonable to expect some defensiveness. You can remind yourself that their initial reaction might not reflect the entire conversation's outcome. What could you say next if they react defensively?

User: Maybe I could say, “I understand this is hard to hear, but I just want to share how I feel and hope we can find a middle ground.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent response—it shows you’re open to dialogue. How do you feel about your ability to approach this conversation now?

User: I feel a little more confident. It’s still scary, but I think I can try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! With practice and these strategies, it sounds like you'll be better prepared to approach your parents. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss around this before we conclude your session today?

User: I’m not sure. I just hope this really helps our relationship.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dedicated to improving that relationship, Xiaoyu. Remember, it takes time, and that’s okay. Reflecting on your progress can also help reinforce your confidence. If you feel isolated at school, we can explore those feelings further in our next session. 

User: Yeah, I’d like that. I feel a bit lonely at school too because of a few things.

Consultant: I’ll be here to help you with that whenever you’re ready. For now, practice what we talked about, and remember, I’m here for you anytime. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate that!

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoyu! Take care, and I look forward to our next session together.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! It's great to see you again today. I remember our last session focused on understanding and managing your impulsive feelings, and it seems like you’ve been reflecting on that. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit isolated at school. My classmates recently laughed at my nickname, and I got really angry and ended up in a conflict with one of them. I felt helpless and overwhelmed.

Consultant: I can see that must have been really tough for you, Xiaoyu. Feeling isolated and dealing with conflicts can be very distressing. Let's explore what happened during that situation. What thoughts crossed your mind when your classmates laughed at you?

User: I thought they were being mean and that nobody wanted to be my friend. It felt like I was a joke, and I just couldn’t hold back my anger.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like their laughter triggered a strong emotional response in you. When you felt that anger rising, what was happening in your body or mind at that moment?

User: My heart started racing, and I felt heat rising in my chest. It was like I just wanted to shout at them or fight back.

Consultant: Your body was reacting strongly to those feelings. It’s common to feel that surge of emotions physically. When we have those intense feelings, it can be challenging to think clearly. Can you recall if there was a specific thought that really made you feel angry or hurt in that moment?

User: I kept thinking that they always make fun of me, and I felt really alone. It made me feel smaller, like I don’t belong there at all.

Consultant: That feeling of not belonging can be really painful. It seems like your classmates’ behavior brought up a lot of deep-seated feelings of rejection. Let's look at the thought that “nobody wants to be your friend.” How valid do you think that thought is? Can we find any evidence for or against it?

User: Well, I know I have a couple of friends, but sometimes it feels like they don’t really want to hang out with me. I don’t know... it just feels like I’m always on the outside.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when negative experiences happen. However, it might help to challenge that thought a bit. What would you say to a friend if they were feeling the same way you are right now?

User: I would tell them that they do have friends and that it’s okay to focus on those who care about them instead.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Focusing on supportive relationships can help shift that narrative. Let’s also talk about managing those intense emotions when they arise. Have you tried any strategies since we last met to calm yourself?

User: I’ve been trying to breathe deeply when I get upset, but it’s hard to remember in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! It can help ground you when you feel that anger bubbling up. Let's practice that together right now. Take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then slowly release it. How did that feel?

User: It felt okay, but I'm not sure if I'd remember to do it when I'm really angry.

Consultant: That's a common challenge. One way to make it easier is to practice when you're calm, so it becomes more automatic during those intense moments. Let’s set a goal for you this week. Can you aim to practice deep breathing at least once a day, even when you’re feeling fine?

User: I can try that. I’ll see if I can remember to do it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! In addition to practicing breathing, I want to encourage you to find ways to engage with others at school. Are there any clubs or activities you’re interested in that you might want to join?

User: I’ve thought about joining the art club, but I’m worried that it’ll be awkward or that nobody will want to talk to me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way at first. Starting something new can be intimidating. However, remember that everyone is there to meet others and share their interests. What do you think would be a small step to take that could help ease you into that situation?

User: Maybe I could just go to one meeting and see how it feels? I could sit back and observe first.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Taking it step by step can help you feel more comfortable. When you go, remember to practice your breathing techniques if you start to feel anxious. How does that plan sound to you?

User: It makes sense! I think I can handle that. 

Consultant: Fantastic, Xiaoyu! I’m proud of you for being open to trying new things and for working on those breathing techniques. Remember that it's okay to take your time in building friendships. How are you feeling about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I still feel anxious about school, but I think I have some strategies now. It helps to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Acknowledging those feelings is a big step, and developing strategies to cope is equally important. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re going to focus on deep breathing, try visiting the art club, and continue reflecting on your thoughts. 

User: Yes, I think that’s a good plan!

Consultant: Great! Remember, it’s normal to feel anxious, and taking these steps will help build your confidence. In our next session, we can talk about how those experiences went and explore any new feelings that arise. You're making progress, and I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyu! I’m looking forward to hearing how everything goes. Take care until we meet next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to work on my social skills, but I still feel anxious in group activities at school. It’s discouraging. 

Consultant: It sounds like you've been putting in effort but are still facing challenges. Can you tell me more about a recent experience in a group activity where you felt anxious or out of place?

User: Well, in our last group project, I couldn’t express my ideas properly. My classmates didn’t seem interested in what I had to say, and I felt like they were excluding me. It made me feel really sad and anxious about participating again.

Consultant: I understand. Feeling excluded can be really tough, especially when you're trying to connect with others. What specific thoughts crossed your mind during that situation? 

User: I thought maybe they didn't like me or that I wasn't good enough. Those thoughts made me want to avoid speaking up at all.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really painful, and it’s understandable you would feel that way. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that they don’t like you or that you’re not good enough?

User: I don't know... there might not be real evidence. It just feels that way sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a really important realization, Xiaoyu! It seems like your feelings about the situation are influencing your thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would tell them not to think that way and that they might be misinterpreting things. Not everyone has to like them.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to see things objectively when it’s someone else. Let’s practice that mindset a bit. What if we reversed your thoughts and instead created some positive affirmations about yourself? 

User: Like what? 

Consultant: How about something like, "I have valuable ideas to share," or "It's okay if not everyone accepts me; I still have friends who care." What do you think about that?

User: I like those. They sound more supportive than my usual thoughts.

Consultant: Great! Let's work on using these affirmations when you start feeling anxious in social situations. We can role-play a scenario where you could use them, perhaps during your next group activity. Would you like to try that?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. 

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s create a situation where you might need to voice your opinion. Picture this: you’re in a group discussion and want to share your idea. How would you start?

User: I guess I could say, "Excuse me, I have an idea I’d like to share."

Consultant: That’s a good start! And if your thoughts start to drift towards negativity, remember to use your affirmations. Can you think of how you might remind yourself to do this?

User: I could just say to myself, "I have valuable ideas," before I speak up.

Consultant: Perfect! Practicing this can help you build confidence. How do you feel about trying this in your next group session?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. I’ll give it a shot!

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Remember, it’s also okay to feel nervous. As for today, how about we discuss what else could help you feel more comfortable in these situations?

User: Maybe I could prepare some points in advance? That might help me feel more ready.

Consultant: Preparing points is an excellent idea! It can help you feel more in control. Can you think of specific points related to an upcoming group task?

User: Yes, we have a science project coming up, and I could prepare my thoughts on how to conduct our experiment.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By preparing, you give yourself the chance to engage more easily in the conversation. How do you feel about having a small role in this project, like suggesting who might do what?

User: I think I could suggest roles. I like that idea!

Consultant: That sounds empowering! Taking on that small responsibility can give you a sense of presence in the group. What are some strategies you might use to suggest these roles?

User: I could say, "I think we can divide the tasks by strengths. I’m interested in collecting data."

Consultant: Excellent! That approach is collaborative, and it encourages others to contribute too. It gives you the chance to shine! 

User: Thanks, I feel a bit better thinking about it this way.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Before we finish today, let's recap what you've learned and how you plan to approach your next group activity.

User: I’ll use positive affirmations, prepare my thoughts, and suggest roles based on our strengths. 

Consultant: That's a strong plan, Xiaoyu! As you practice these skills, remember to be kind to yourself. It’s a process, and setbacks may happen, but you’re taking significant steps toward improvement.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Let’s keep building on this progress in our next session. I’m looking forward to hearing how your group project goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good about my communication with my parents. We’ve been using some of the techniques I learned. But I'm still really worried about how to talk to my classmates at school.

Consultant: That's a wonderful start, Xiaoyu! I'm glad to hear that your conversations with your parents have improved. It sounds like there's some apprehension about transferring those skills to your classmates. What specific situations at school make you feel most concerned?

User: Well, during group project meetings, I often don’t know how to join the conversation. Sometimes I just stay quiet because I’m afraid I’ll say something wrong.

Consultant: I see, that sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in group settings. Let’s explore this further. Can you recall a recent group project and how you felt during one of those meetings?

User: Yes, last week we had a science project meeting. I had some ideas, but I just kept thinking that my contributions wouldn’t be good enough. So, I just listened while others talked.

Consultant: It sounds like you had valuable ideas but felt uncertain about sharing them. When you think of your contributions not being good enough, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I just keep thinking that others will judge me or that my ideas are silly compared to theirs.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to hold a lot of weight for you. Let's consider this: what evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Have your classmates ever reacted negatively to you before?

User: Not really. At least, they haven't made fun of me or anything. But I still feel like I won't measure up.

Consultant: So, it seems like you may be placing a lot of pressure on yourself based on assumptions rather than reality. If a friend was feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that they should just share their ideas anyway because everyone has something to contribute.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you recognize the value in everyone's input, including your own. Let’s try to shift that mindset towards yourself. What if you reframed your thinking to reflect that you also have valuable things to offer?

User: I guess that could help. I could tell myself that my ideas might be helpful, even if they aren’t perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s perfectly okay for ideas to not be perfect. That's how collaboration works—everyone brings their unique thoughts to the table. Let’s think about a small step you could take in your next group project. What would be a manageable way to contribute?

User: Maybe I could just start by stating one small idea during the next meeting, even if I'm unsure about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Starting with one small idea feels like a safe way to practice. How would you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also a bit excited. It feels like a good challenge.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous when stepping outside your comfort zone. That excitement indicates that you are ready to grow! After the meeting, how could we reflect on how it went?

User: I could maybe write down how it felt to share my idea and how my classmates responded.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Writing down your experiences will help you process them better. You can also look for any positive feedback, no matter how small. How does that sound?

User: It sounds really helpful! I think it would help me notice my progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s also think ahead a little. If you encounter any negative reactions, what might you remind yourself of in that moment?

User: I guess I could remind myself that not everyone will like my ideas, and that’s okay. I have something valuable to offer.

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! Keeping that in mind will help you stay resilient. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've gained from our discussion?

User: I feel more confident about trying to share my ideas, and I have a plan to help me reflect on it afterward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Xiaoyu! Remember, taking small steps is key. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. You’re doing great work on your social skills!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to try this out and talk about it next time!

Consultant: You're welcome! Just remember, it’s all about practice and self-compassion as you progress. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good lately. I participated in some school activities with a positive attitude, and I even spoke in front of the class. A few classmates recognized me, which made me happy.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience! It’s amazing to hear that you are taking these new steps in social interactions. How did it feel for you to speak in front of your class?

User: At first, I was really nervous and worried about what they would think of me. But once I started talking, it wasn't so bad! I even got some smiles from my classmates.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiaoyu! It’s really brave of you to face your nervousness. It seems like you realized that you could handle that anxiety, which is a significant step forward. How has that affected your feelings about participating in social situations now?

User: I feel a bit more confident, but there are still times when I worry about what to say or whether I’ll mess up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries, especially when you're trying something new. Let’s talk about those feelings when they come up. Can you remember a specific thought you had when you were worried about saying the wrong thing?

User: I thought to myself, "What if I say something stupid and everyone laughs at me?" It made me really anxious leading up to the moment.

Consultant: That’s a very common thought, and it can create a lot of anxiety. What do you think might happen if you were to challenge that thought? For instance, how realistic do you think it is that everyone would laugh?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. Most of my classmates are nice, and they probably would just be supportive.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing those cognitive distortions is a great first step. If you had to give advice to a friend who felt the same way, what would you suggest they tell themselves in that situation?

User: I’d tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that people are usually understanding.

Consultant: That's right! You already possess a lot of wisdom when it comes to supporting others. Now, let’s apply that to yourself. How can we create a positive affirmation for you to use in those moments of doubt?

User: Maybe something like, "It’s okay to make mistakes; I’m here to learn and grow."

Consultant: That’s a beautiful affirmation, Xiaoyu! Using that can help shift your focus during social interactions. Let’s also plan a few small tasks for you to practice expressing yourself freely. What do you think about initiating a conversation with a classmate this week?

User: I could try that! Maybe I can ask someone about their favorite video game?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Starting with common interests can ease the conversation. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself this week, like chatting with at least one classmate?

User: I feel excited! I’ll definitely give it a try and see how it goes.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember to observe how you feel before, during, and after the conversation. Reflection is an essential part of this process. After you have your chat, we can review together next time. 

User: Okay! I’ll try to remember to reflect on it all.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also take a moment to celebrate the progress you’ve made. You stepped out of your comfort zone and were recognized for it. How does that feel looking back?

User: It feels really good. I didn't expect anyone to notice, but I guess I made a little impact.

Consultant: Absolutely! You are definitely making an impact, and it’s important to acknowledge that. As we continue working together, how can we ensure you keep that momentum going?

User: I think setting small goals each week would help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Small goals lead to steady progress. Let’s work on identifying specific social situations each week that you can engage in, and we can check in on your feelings and progress.

User: Yes, I’d like that! I want to keep growing socially.

Consultant: I'm really proud of your determination, Xiaoyu. Today, we’ve discussed some of your positive progress and set goals for the coming week. How are you feeling now about your ability to engage socially?

User: I feel more hopeful and confident that I can keep improving.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today, let's summarize our discussion. You’ve made strides in expressing yourself and you've shown great courage. You have strategies to challenge negative thoughts and create positive affirmations to support your journey. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have tools to help me.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it’s all about taking things one step at a time. I believe in your ability to navigate social interactions positively. If you ever feel unsure, just reflect on what we’ve discussed.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to trying out what we talked about.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyu! I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experiences next time. Keep believing in yourself, and remember these moments of growth. See you next week!

User: See you! I’ll work on my goals!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I’ve made some friends and participated more in class activities. It feels good.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Building friendships and engaging in activities can be such a confidence booster. What has been the best part about these new interactions for you?

User: It’s exciting to have people to talk to and share things with. I feel less lonely than before.

Consultant: I can imagine that feeling less lonely must be very comforting. Given this progress, what aspects of your social interactions do you feel you’d like to continue to improve or focus on moving forward?

User: I think I want to become more confident when I talk to new people. Sometimes, I still feel nervous in those situations.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel nervous when meeting new people, especially if it's still a new experience for you. Let's explore that a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel nervous in social situations?

User: I often worry that they won’t like me or that I’ll say something silly.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely amplify your nervousness. It seems like you're concerned about how others perceive you. How do you think those thoughts impact your behavior in social situations?

User: They make me want to avoid talking to new people altogether. Sometimes I just stay quiet instead of joining in.

Consultant: Avoidance can seem like a safe choice in the moment, but it can prevent you from building those connections. What do you think might happen if you tried to challenge those worries and engage with new people despite feeling nervous?

User: I guess I would have a chance to make more friends and not miss out on fun things. But it’s just scary.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared, but remember that growth often happens outside our comfort zones. What do you think might be a small step you could take to face this fear of engaging with others?

User: Maybe I could start by saying hello to someone new during lunch. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! A simple "hello" can open up opportunities for conversation. How do you think you’ll feel afterward if you do that?

User: I might feel proud of myself! Even if it feels tough, I think it could help me get used to talking to new people.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that small step can lead to a sense of accomplishment. Let’s also think about a strategy to support you in this process. How can you remind yourself of your strengths when you feel those worries creeping in?

User: Perhaps I could make a list of positive things about myself to refer to. That could help me remember my worth.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Having a tangible reminder of your strengths can help you reframe your thoughts in those anxious moments. Would you like to set a specific goal around this for our next session?

User: Yeah! I could create that list and maybe practice saying hello to someone new a couple of times.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Next session, we can reflect on how that went and any new insights you gained. Until then, how do you feel about the strategies we've talked about today in reinforcing your confidence?

User: I feel good about it! It seems manageable and gives me hope for improvement.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Xiaoyu! You've worked hard to reach this point, and it's great to see your motivation. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thanks! I’ll definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve achieved and your goals for the coming weeks. You've made significant strides in building connections and practicing social skills. What are your key takeaways from this session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is to challenge my negative thoughts and take small steps toward socializing. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Keep focusing on those small steps and remind yourself of your strengths along the way. If you encounter challenges, it’s okay; just let them guide your growth. 

User: I appreciate that! I feel ready to keep practicing.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep implementing these skills, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Me too! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: Of course, Xiaoyu! Remember, you can always reach out if you need to talk about anything sooner. Have a wonderful time applying these strategies in your life!

User: I will! Thanks again.
