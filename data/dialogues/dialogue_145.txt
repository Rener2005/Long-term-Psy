Consultant: Hello, little C! I'm glad you came to talk today. How are you feeling, and what brings you here?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really anxious lately, especially after I didn’t do well on a recent test. I’m scared about messing up again, and it makes me feel so tense.

Consultant: I hear you, that sounds really tough. You’re feeling scared of failure, and that’s making you anxious. Can you tell me a bit more about how this anxiety affects you, especially related to your need to use the bathroom?

User: Well, it’s like every time I get nervous, I feel like I need to go to the bathroom. And sometimes during class, I can’t raise my hand to ask to go because I’m too scared.

Consultant: It must be really hard to focus in class when you’re feeling that way. It sounds like your worry about using the bathroom makes you even more anxious. Have there been specific moments in class where this gets really tough for you?

User: Yes, when the teacher calls on someone, I get scared that I’ll have to go, but I don’t want to be noticed. I remember last time, I really had to go but couldn't ask, so I ended up using napkins to avoid an accident.

Consultant: That sounds very stressful, little C. It seems like this experience of needing to go can make your anxiety worse. Let’s try to take a step back—what do you think when you feel that anxiety coming on? What thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think things like, “What if I can’t hold it?” or “What if I get in trouble again?” It feels like I just can’t handle it.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and scary. You mentioned feeling anxious about getting in trouble again, especially after your dad reacted strongly last time. Can we try to explore what you might say to yourself when those fears come up?

User: I usually just try to tell myself to stay quiet and hope it goes away. But it doesn’t help much.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’d want to try to avoid feeling that way, but it seems like that approach isn’t working for you. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts a bit? Let’s think together—what evidence do you have that something bad will happen if you need to go to the bathroom during class?

User: I don’t really know. My dad didn’t say much this time when I did poorly, but we didn’t talk about it.

Consultant: It sounds like your dad is trying not to put too much pressure on you now. So maybe that thought of getting in trouble isn’t as solid as it feels. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises to help calm your anxiety when you feel it coming on?

User: I guess that could help. I just want to feel better and not be so scared.

Consultant: Let’s work on it together! When you start feeling anxious, we can practice breathing in slowly for four counts, holding for four, and then breathing out for four counts. This can help bring your focus away from those worries and back to your body. 

User: Okay, that sounds okay. I’ll try it.

Consultant: Great! I’m proud of you for being willing to try. And remember, it’s okay to excuse yourself when you need to use the bathroom. Everyone goes, and your feelings are important. 

User: I know it’s okay, but it’s just hard to remind myself in the moment.

Consultant: It can be really difficult to remember in the moment, especially under pressure. Let’s make a plan together. How about we write down some comforting phrases you can repeat to yourself, reminding you it’s okay to take care of yourself?

User: That sounds good! I could use that.

Consultant: Awesome! How about starting with something like, “It’s okay to take a break when I need to. My feelings matter”? Do you like that, or should we change it?

User: I like that! I think it would help me to remember to take a break.

Consultant: I’m glad you like it! It’s important to remind yourself that your well-being comes first. Now, let’s think about some activities you enjoy that can help you feel more relaxed during the day. What do you like to do for fun?

User: I like drawing and reading. It makes me feel good to focus on something else.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! How about we set a goal for you to spend a little time every day drawing or reading? This could help distract you from anxious thoughts and let you express yourself.

User: Yeah, I’d like that! It would make me feel better.

Consultant: Perfect! So we’ll aim for some daily drawing or reading time, and we can check in on how that feels next time we meet. Remember, making small steps can lead to big changes over time. 

User: Okay, I’ll try!

Consultant: I believe in you, little C. And as we wrap up today, let’s revisit what we’ve talked about. You’ve got some new tools to use when you feel anxious, including deep breathing and comforting phrases. How do you feel about what you’ve learned today?

User: I feel a bit better knowing I can try something different. Thank you for listening.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s very brave of you to share your feelings, and I’m here to help. Over the next week, remember to be kind to yourself. When we meet again, we can discuss how it went and work on more ways to help you feel comfortable at school. 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Take care, little C! I'm looking forward to seeing the progress you make. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time.

Consultant: Hello, Little C! I'm really glad you decided to come in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel kind of worried. I tried to express my feelings during class activities, but I couldn't stop thinking about what others might say. It makes me feel really anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure about what your classmates might think. Can you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when you want to express yourself?

User: I just think they’ll laugh at me or judge me if I say something silly. Sometimes I get so nervous that I just stay quiet.

Consultant: I understand that it's tough to feel that way. It’s important to recognize those thoughts. Let's explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that your classmates would laugh at you?

User: I don't know, it’s just a feeling I get. I thought maybe they would because I feel clumsy talking in front of them.

Consultant: It’s really common to have those feelings, but we can try to challenge them together. If a friend was in your position, feeling nervous about speaking up, what would you tell her?

User: I would probably say it’s okay to try and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive thing to say! So, if you were to apply that same kindness to yourself, what do you think would happen if you tried to express your thoughts in class?

User: Maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as I think. I guess I might feel relieved afterward.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking that step could bring some relief. How about we create a small plan? Maybe start with something simple to say during the next class.

User: That sounds okay. I could maybe just share one thing instead of trying to say a lot.

Consultant: Yes, starting small is great. It allows you to build confidence gradually. How about we also think of a phrase you can use to remind yourself to stay calm when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to be myself”?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful phrase! You can repeat that to yourself when you start feeling anxious. How do you feel about using that in class?

User: I feel a little better thinking about it. But I'm still worried about what happens if I do get really anxious like before.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way, especially if you've had tough experiences. We can also practice some mindfulness techniques that can help you ground yourself when those feelings arise. Would you like to try one now?

User: Yes, I would like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale deeply through your nose… and slowly exhale through your mouth. Keep doing that while focusing on your breath. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice. I think it helps to just focus on breathing.

Consultant: That's fantastic, Little C! Practicing this regularly can really help you manage anxiety in tense situations. How about we plan for you to use this breathing technique right before you want to speak up in class?

User: I think I can do that. It sounds helpful.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, the goal is to be gentle with yourself while you try these new strategies. Can you share with me how you feel about your relationship with your mom lately?

User: I’ve been feeling like she doesn’t really get me. Sometimes, it feels like she’s too busy with my little brother and doesn’t notice how I feel.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s important to feel heard by the people we care about. What do you think you might do to share your feelings with her?

User: Maybe I could tell her that I want to talk, but I don’t know how. I feel nervous about that too.

Consultant: That’s a good first step! You could also mention that you’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and that it would mean a lot to you if you could talk together. How do you feel about starting that conversation?

User: I think I could try. Just writing it down could help me organize what I want to say.

Consultant: Writing it down is an excellent idea! It can help you express your thoughts more clearly. Remember, it's about finding that balance and sharing what you need. 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about talking to her now. Thank you.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! As we continue our sessions, we'll work on building your confidence not just in class, but also in your relationships. It’s all part of your journey. 

User: I’m excited to see how it goes. I’ve been hoping for things to get better.

Consultant: Yes, and they can, Little C! Let’s keep taking these steps together. You’re doing such a great job. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on for our next session?

User: I want to work on being less anxious during class and figuring out how to approach my mom about my feelings.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ll dive deeper into those topics next time. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support before then. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better talking about everything.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here for you, and I'm proud of the steps you're taking. I look forward to our next session. Take care, Little C!
###################
Consultant: Hello, C! I'm glad you came to talk today. How are you feeling right now, especially after your recent experiences with your mother and the anxiety about your studies?

User: Hi! I feel pretty upset. I think my mom cares more about my little brother than me. Sometimes I just feel invisible, especially when things get tough at school, like when I have to go to the bathroom so often. It's really embarrassing!

Consultant: It sounds really tough for you to feel overlooked and to deal with the anxiety about school and your frequent bathroom visits. Let's take a moment to talk about how you've been feeling overall, especially when you're preparing for exams. 

User: I've been feeling really anxious, and it's hard to concentrate on my studies. I worry about not being able to perform well and keep thinking about what happened with my dad and the exam. 

Consultant: I hear you, C. It's understandable that you'd feel anxious after that experience. What thoughts go through your mind when you're feeling anxious about your performance or your visits to the bathroom during classes?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, maybe my parents will get angry again. And sometimes, I worry that if I need to go to the bathroom during a lesson, what will others think? 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. You mentioned that thinking about your performance and worrying about what others think makes you feel anxious. Could you share more about how those thoughts make you feel in your body?

User: My heart races, and I feel like I need to go to the bathroom right away. It’s like a panic, and I get all shaky. 

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable, C. It seems your body responds strongly when you feel anxious. Let’s take some time to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your parents will react negatively if you don't perform well? 

User: I don’t really know... maybe it was just that one time. I guess they have high expectations, but they also want me to do my best. 

Consultant: That’s a really important realization. It sounds like they want the best for you and care about how you feel, even if it doesn't always come across that way. Can you think of a friend who might be in a similar position? How would you encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it's okay to not be perfect and to just try their best. It’s not the end of the world if things don’t go as planned. 

Consultant: Exactly, C! It’s a good reminder for yourself too. What if you applied that same kindness to yourself? How might that change the way you feel about your performance or your needs in class?

User: I think it would help me feel calmer, like I’m allowed to make mistakes without feeling scared all the time. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! It’s important to be compassionate towards yourself. Now let's address your concerns about communicating with your mother. How do you feel about practicing what to say to her when you want to express your feelings?

User: I think it would be helpful. I often just stay quiet because I don’t want to make her more upset. 

Consultant: Let’s try a role-playing exercise. How about you speak to me like I’m your mother? What would you want to say to her if you felt comfortable expressing your feelings?

User: Okay... Um, I would say, “Mom, I feel like I need your attention sometimes too, not just the baby’s.” 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s clear and direct. Now, how do you think your mom might respond to that? 

User: I hope she would understand because I do need her to notice me more. 

Consultant: That hope is valid, C. What if she doesn't respond the way you would like? How might you handle that?

User: I guess I’ll just have to remind myself that I can still communicate my feelings and keep trying. 

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Consistency is key, and it's okay to express your needs multiple times. What other ways could you show your mom that you appreciate her, which might also open up channels for her to see you?

User: Maybe if I ask her to help me with my homework, she might spend more time with me? 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Asking for help can create more opportunities for connection. Now, how do you feel about implementing what we've talked about today regarding your feelings and communication?

User: I feel a little better. It’s nice to talk about it and not hold it in. I know I still worry about my frequent urination and exams, but I feel like I have some tools to manage it. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, C. It’s wonderful that you’re starting to feel more empowered. Remember, it's a process, and you can take it one step at a time. When you reflect on today’s session, what do you think is the main takeaway?

User: I think I learned that it’s okay to express my feelings and that I can try to be kinder to myself. 

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! After our discussions, I believe you’re on a promising path. We can continue practicing these skills together in our future sessions. How do you feel leaving today’s meeting?

User: I feel like I can work on things a bit better, but I still want to keep talking about these issues. 

Consultant: Absolutely, we can delve deeper into what’s bothering you in our next session, C. Thank you for opening up today. You’re making great strides towards understanding and improving your feelings. 

User: Thank you! I’m glad I came.
###################
Consultant: Hello, little C! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after the family gathering where my relatives praised me. But I'm still worried about my frequent urges to go to the bathroom, especially during classes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you felt more confident at the family gathering! That’s a positive step. Let's discuss your concerns about the bathroom situation. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you feel that urge during class?

User: I think about how embarrassing it would be if I can't hold it and need to ask the teacher. I get scared that everyone will notice.

Consultant: That’s a very understandable concern. It sounds like you're feeling anxious about being judged. What happens when you hold it in rather than asking for permission to go?

User: I try to hold it, but it just makes me feel more anxious, and then I feel even more desperate to go urgently.

Consultant: It seems like holding it in leads to even more stress. Have you ever thought about what might happen if you simply let your teacher know you need to go? 

User: I guess I worry they might think I'm making excuses or that I'm not focused on learning.

Consultant: That’s quite a common worry, but it’s important to realize that teachers understand students have physical needs. Would it help if we brainstormed some phrases you could use to feel more comfortable asking to leave the room?

User: Maybe... like just saying, "Can I go to the bathroom, please?" But sometimes I feel like I won't even be able to speak.

Consultant: That’s a brave thought! Just practicing that simple phrase can make it feel less daunting. We could even try a little role play if you’d like. How comfortable are you with that idea?

User: I think that could help. I’ll practice saying it a bit more confidently.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Let’s also think about some positive affirmations we can create together. These can help remind you of your strengths whenever you feel anxious. Can you think of a few things you do well?

User: I like to draw and my teachers say I’m good at it. I also got compliments for my presentation at school.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! It’s clear you have a lot of talent. How about we create an affirmation like, “I am a talented artist and a good presenter”? Would that resonate with you?

User: Yes, I think that would help remind me of my abilities!

Consultant: Perfect! You can repeat that affirmation to yourself whenever you start feeling anxious. How do you feel about possibly writing it down in a journal every day?

User: Writing it down sounds fun! I think it would help me remember.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Journaling can be a great way to track your progress and feelings. Let’s also reflect on some positive experiences from the past week. What are some moments you felt proud of yourself?

User: Well, I remembered to ask to use the bathroom during a class last week! I felt really relieved after doing that.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! You should be very proud of yourself for advocating for your needs. How did you feel afterwards?

User: I felt really happy and relieved that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It seems like you’re building more confidence every day. What would you like to focus on in our next session to keep this momentum going?

User: I want to keep practicing asking to go to the bathroom and also feel less anxious about exams.

Consultant: That’s a great focus. We can develop strategies for handling anxiety during exams and reinforce your confidence. Remember, you are already making progress! I look forward to hearing about more successes in our next meeting. 

User: Thank you! I’m excited for our next session too!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just remember to celebrate each small victory along the way. I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoc! I'm really glad to see you here today. How has your week been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I think it's been okay. I'm feeling a bit more positive about interacting with my classmates, but I still feel anxious sometimes, especially with exams coming up.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re feeling more positive with your classmates! It’s natural to feel anxious about exams. What specific feelings do you experience during those times?

User: I usually feel my heart racing, and I start to worry about needing to go to the bathroom. It's really distracting.

Consultant: It sounds uncomfortable to have those physical sensations when you're focused on other tasks. Have you noticed any situations recently where those feelings of anxiety were particularly strong? 

User: Well, during the class this week when we were preparing for the exam, I felt really anxious, like I had to go to the bathroom a lot. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiaoc. Let’s explore those thoughts you had during that class. What were you thinking when you felt the urge to go to the bathroom?

User: I thought I wouldn’t be able to handle it if I waited too long, and then I worried what my friends would think if I left class again.

Consultant: It sounds like that thought made you feel even more anxious. Can we challenge that thought together? What evidence do you have that leaving the class would lead to a negative outcome?

User: I guess it’s just my fear of what others might think. No one actually said anything bad about me before. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about what others think; many people feel that way. What do you think might happen if you remind yourself that your classmates are likely more understanding than you assume?

User: I think I might feel a bit better. They’re all in the same situation, right? 

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone experiences stress in school. Let’s think about specific strategies you can use when that anxiety arises. Have you tried any relaxation techniques lately?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I used to try deep breathing exercises, but I sort of forgot about them.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a really effective way to manage anxiety. Would you like to practice a quick exercise together now, so you can use it during those school moments?

User: Sure! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Okay! Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold it for four… and now breathe out gently through your mouth for a count of four. How does that feel? 

User: It feels nice! I can almost feel the tension easing a little.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It’s great to hear that. This is a technique you can revisit whenever you feel anxious, especially during exams. Let’s also talk about creating a list of positive reminders about your progress. What would you like to include on that list?

User: I’d like to include trying for class leader—I felt really encouraged by my friends!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement, Xiaoc! Including your courage to run for class leader shows your growth. What else would you like to add?

User: I think I should add remembering that it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. I just need to manage it better. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It's completely normal to feel anxious, and it’s impressive that you’re learning how to manage it. Would you like to complete any other goals or actions to support your confidence moving forward?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it's okay to ask to go to the bathroom without worrying too much about what others think.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! You’re actively promoting your own well-being, which is excellent. Is there anything else you want to reflect on or prepare for after today’s session?

User: I think I want to remind myself of the techniques we practiced. They really help when I start feeling overwhelmed!

Consultant: Thank you for sharing, Xiaoc! It’s wonderful to see your confidence grow. As we conclude today, let’s recap what you’ve learned. What are your key takeaways from our sessions?

User: I have learned to use deep breathing and remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. And I should focus on the support from my friends!

Consultant: Those are important insights! You've made significant progress in understanding and managing your feelings. Remember, you're not alone; you’ve got supportive friends and strategies at your disposal. 

User: Thank you so much for your help! I feel more hopeful about everything now.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Xiaoc! Keep practicing those strategies, and I believe you will continue to grow. Whenever you feel ready for another session, just let me know. Take care, and good luck with everything ahead!

User: Thank you! Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, C! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident since I became the class hygiene monitor. It feels nice to be recognized by my teacher, but I’m still worried about my anxiety and the frequent trips to the bathroom. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident and recognized! Let’s explore how that positivity has affected your anxiety. Can you share a bit more about the times when your anxiety comes up?

User: Well, I often get anxious about exams and sitting through classes. Sometimes, I can’t hold it and I just feel scared to ask to go to the bathroom. It’s really embarrassing.

Consultant: I can imagine how challenging and uncomfortable that must be for you. You mentioned feeling scared to ask for help in those moments. Can you tell me what thoughts run through your mind during those times?

User: I think that if I ask, everyone will look at me. I’m worried they'll think it's silly that I have to go so often. 

Consultant: That sounds very tough, feeling like you’re being judged. Have you noticed how that thought affects your feelings when you’re in class?

User: Yes, it makes my heart race and I feel really nervous. Then, I get even more desperate to go to the bathroom. 

Consultant: So, it seems like there’s a cycle where the thought of being judged leads to increased anxiety, which in turn makes you feel like you have to go more. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that your classmates would think it's silly?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. They might just understand. 

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It’s possible that they might be more understanding than you think. What would you say if one of your friends was in a similar situation?

User: I would definitely tell them it’s okay to ask. Everyone has to go sometimes!

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve just shown how you can support your friends. Now, let’s think about how you can support yourself in those moments. Can we brainstorm some strategies together?

User: Sure! Maybe I could take a deep breath to calm down before asking.

Consultant: Breathing is a wonderful strategy! It can help ground you. What about practicing a simple phrase to use when you need to excuse yourself? 

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe I could say, "Excuse me, I need to use the restroom." 

Consultant: Yes, that’s perfect! Having a script to follow can make it easier when you're nervous. How about developing a plan for when you have exams coming up?

User: I think I could try to tell myself to focus on doing my best and that it’s okay to take breaks. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Focusing on your best efforts and allowing yourself breaks can really help alleviate some pressure. How does that make you feel thinking about your exams this way? 

User: I feel a bit less anxious just thinking about it. 

Consultant: That's great to hear, C! Let’s focus on setting small, achievable goals for your upcoming study sessions. What would you like to achieve in your study sessions?

User: I’d like to make a study schedule that doesn’t feel overwhelming. 

Consultant: A balanced study schedule sounds like a wonderful goal! How about we start with breaking it down into smaller tasks? 

User: Yes! I can start with reviewing one subject at a time each day. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! By focusing on one subject, you'll feel less overwhelmed and can manage your time better. How do you plan to keep yourself accountable for this schedule?

User: Maybe I can mark it off on a calendar or ask my mom to check in on me. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Having a visual reminder and support from your mom can really help. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about using these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I think I can handle my anxiety better. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling hopeful! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re already making great progress. Just keep trying these strategies. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your efforts. As we conclude our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today so you can carry it with you. 

User: Okay! I learned about challenging my thoughts, having a plan for asking to go to the bathroom, and creating a study schedule.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve done an amazing job today. Always remember, if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, you can use these strategies to help. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything.

Consultant: You're welcome, C! I'm confident you’ll keep moving forward. If you ever need to chat again, just know that I’m here for you. Have a wonderful day!
