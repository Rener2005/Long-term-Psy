Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really overshadowed at work. My interactions with my colleagues have diminished, and I feel like I’m not part of the team anymore. It's quite frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of isolation and frustration at work. Can you share a bit more about the situation with your colleagues and how that's been affecting you?

User: Well, there's been a lot of pressure with our recent projects, and communication has just dropped. I used to get along well with my team, but now I feel neglected. It’s like I'm invisible.

Consultant: That must be very tough for you, feeling like you're not being acknowledged. Let's explore this feeling of invisibility a bit more. When you think about those interactions, what thoughts or beliefs come to mind?

User: I think maybe my input doesn’t matter anymore, or that they see me as someone who doesn't contribute much. It's hard to shake that feeling off.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel that way, given the changes in communication. However, let's try to challenge that belief. Do you have any evidence that supports the idea that your input doesn't matter?

User: Well, I suppose there were a few moments where I did contribute in meetings, but they didn’t seem to listen or acknowledge my ideas as much. 

Consultant: I hear you. Those experiences can certainly reinforce the feeling that you’re not valued. However, could there be other reasons for their reactions? Perhaps they were preoccupied or overwhelmed?

User: Maybe. I guess it's possible they were just stressed and not intentionally dismissing me. 

Consultant: Exactly! Stress can impact how we communicate. Let's think about ways you could initiate conversations with your colleagues to express your ideas and feelings. What steps do you think could help improve those interactions?

User: Perhaps I could reach out more and share my thoughts even if I feel like they might not care. Maybe setting a one-on-one chat would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Li Ming! Taking the initiative to reach out can help rebuild those connections. How do you feel about initiating that conversation?

User: I’m a bit anxious thinking about it, to be honest. What if they still don’t engage?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about this. However, focusing on your willingness to connect can make a difference. What might happen if you approached it understanding that they might also be feeling stressed?

User: That makes sense. If I approach it from a more empathetic angle, it could open up a better dialogue.

Consultant: Precisely! Empathy can often pave the way for better communication. Let's discuss some specific phrases or questions you might use to open a conversation with them that encourages dialogue.

User: Maybe I could start by asking how they are coping with the workload and then share my own experiences?

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Starting by showing concern for their well-being fosters mutual understanding. What other strategies can you think of that might help reinforce your presence in these conversations?

User: I could ask for feedback on my projects more often. That way, I not only show I'm interested but also invite interaction.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Inviting feedback can help create opportunities for dialogue and demonstrate your commitment. What feelings arise when you think about putting these strategies into practice?

User: I feel a mixture of hope and fear. Hope that it will bring us closer, but fear that it might not change anything.

Consultant: Those mixed emotions are completely valid. It's a step out of your comfort zone, but trying out these strategies can also strengthen your self-confidence. What can you remind yourself of to help manage that fear when the moment comes?

User: I can remind myself that I have valuable contributions and that it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. I’ll just try my best.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your effort rather than the outcome can help ease anxiety. Remember, every small step counts toward rebuilding those bonds. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel more empowered to take action now. It’s refreshing to think that I can improve things rather than just wait for them to change.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about taking proactive steps. As we wrap up today, what is the main insight or takeaway you’ll carry with you?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I need to take charge of my communication with others and approach it with empathy. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight, Li Ming. Prioritizing empathy in your efforts will make a difference. Remember that you're not alone, and I’m here to support you. Would you like to set up a follow-up session to discuss how things go after you apply these strategies?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for your guidance today!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Until next time, take care!

User: Thanks, I will! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hi Li Ming! I'm glad you're here today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hello! I’ve been feeling quite undervalued at work after my suggestion wasn’t accepted during a project meeting. It’s made me question my abilities and I’m struggling with my self-worth.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has impacted your self-esteem and made you feel uncertain about your skills. Let’s explore this a bit more—how did that situation in the meeting make you feel at the time?

User: I felt embarrassed and frustrated. It seemed like my input didn’t matter, and I couldn’t shake off that feeling of being overlooked. 

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. When you think about being overlooked, what thoughts run through your mind about your abilities or value as a team member?

User: I keep thinking that if my ideas weren't valued, then maybe I'm not good at my job. It makes me doubt my competence. 

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Li Ming. It’s understandable to feel that way after such an experience. Let’s try to challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that suggests you’re not good at your job?

User: I guess... I did receive positive feedback from my manager on other projects before, but this incident feels more significant somehow.

Consultant: That’s an important observation. Past positive feedback indicates that there is value in your contributions. How might you consider reframing the situation in which your idea wasn’t accepted?

User: Maybe I can see it as just one opinion among many, and not a reflection of my overall ability. But it’s still hard to shake the negative feelings.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when negative experiences linger. Could we think about some alternative ways to view this? For instance, could it be possible that your idea might not have aligned with the team’s current goals, rather than reflecting your skill?

User: That makes sense. There could have been other factors at play. I suppose I could remind myself that not every idea can be accepted. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about perspective. Let’s think about ways to build your confidence through action. Have you considered participating more in team discussions or sharing ideas with colleagues one-on-one to practice your communication skills?

User: I haven’t really thought about that, but it does sound like a good idea. I'd like to contribute more but I worry about being rejected again.

Consultant: That worry is understandable, but remember that each interaction is a new opportunity. What if we set small, achievable goals for you to gently push your comfort zone? 

User: I think I could start by expressing my thoughts during the next team meeting. It feels challenging, but I want to try.

Consultant: That’s a great first step! Focusing on the act of sharing your perspective can be empowering. How can you ensure you feel prepared for that meeting?

User: I could jot down my thoughts beforehand to articulate them clearly. Maybe even practice what I want to say with a friend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Preparing ahead can help ease some anxiety. How do you feel about approaching your friend for a practice session?

User: I feel more confident. I think having a practice would really help!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Let’s outline a few key points or messages you’d like to communicate during the meeting. What ideas do you have in mind?

User: I could share a few enhancement ideas for our current project, focusing on what I think could add value.

Consultant: Perfect! Framing your suggestions in a constructive way will help in showcasing your expertise. How do you think it will feel to share those ideas?

User: I think it will be empowering, even if not all of them are accepted. It’s about expressing myself.

Consultant: Exactly, and that expression can foster connections with colleagues. As we approach our time today, I’d like to reflect on what steps you're planning to take after our session.

User: I want to prepare my ideas and practice with a friend. And definitely participate more actively in the next meeting!

Consultant: That sounds like a positive strategy! Remember, each small step is a move towards building your confidence and integrating into your team’s social circle. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel hopeful actually, like I can improve my situation!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Keep this momentum going, and don't hesitate to reach out for support whenever you need it. I believe you can achieve this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help a lot. I feel more ready to take on these challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Ming. I look forward to hearing about your progress! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Ming! It's great to see you here today. Last time we talked about your experience at the company gathering, and how you've been feeling unsure about your social skills. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I've been a bit better, but I still feel nervous when interacting with colleagues. I try to join in, but I don't always feel genuine, which makes me tense.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anxiety and a desire to connect with your colleagues. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel not genuine in those social situations?

User: I think it’s more about my own self-image. I worry that people can see I’m not being myself, and that makes me act even more stiffly. 

Consultant: Recognizing that feeling is a good step. It seems like there's a lot of pressure you place on yourself to be perceived a certain way. Let’s explore that—what kind of self-image are you trying to project when you're with your colleagues?

User: I want them to see me as confident and approachable. But instead, I just freeze up and end up saying things I don't really mean.

Consultant: So the goal is to be seen as confident, but it leads to tension and discomfort. Can you recall a specific moment from the gathering when you felt this way? What thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: Yes, during the discussions, my mind was racing, and all I could think was, "What if I say something stupid?" That made it hard for me to stay engaged.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts added to your anxiety. Those types of worries can often distort our view of reality. What evidence do you have that saying something “stupid” would lead to a negative outcome?

User: Well, I just keep imagining that everyone would laugh at me or think I’m incompetent. 

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to worry about how our mistakes may be perceived. If a friend were in your situation and had made an error, how might you advise them to view it?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to just laugh it off. 

Consultant: Exactly, it sounds like you have a more compassionate view for others than for yourself. Let’s practice shifting that perspective onto you. How can you remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes when you're in social situations?

User: I suppose I could tell myself that nobody's perfect, and even if I mess up, it’s not the end of the world.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Let’s try using this as a mantra for when you practice socialization. Now, are there any opportunities coming up to engage with your colleagues again?

User: There might be another team lunch next week. I want to give it another shot.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How about we plan a few actions for you to take before that lunch? For instance, setting a small goal for yourself?

User: Maybe I could aim to share one personal story or ask a question to someone during lunch?

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Sharing a personal story or asking a question can help make you feel more connected. What kind of personal story do you think you could share?

User: I could mention a new hobby I've taken up, like hiking. 

Consultant: That sounds like a refreshing topic! Is there a particular experience you had while hiking that you feel comfortable sharing?

User: I went hiking last month—got lost but ended up finding a beautiful viewpoint! It was challenging but worth it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful story! It not only shows your adventurous side but could spark a conversation. Remembering experiences like this can help ease your tension in the moment. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but also excited. It seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a balanced approach! It’s natural to feel some anxiety when trying new things. How will you remind yourself of the potential positive outcomes during the lunch?

User: I think I’ll keep telling myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m there to enjoy the company, not just to impress anyone.

Consultant: That’s a powerful mindset to adopt! Let’s take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You’re prepared to share a personal story about your hiking experience and to ask a question during the lunch, reminding yourself that mistakes are part of sharing.

User: Yes, exactly! I feel like I have a clearer plan now.

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe this experience will help you not only with integrating into your social circle but also boost your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s about being kind to myself and trying to enjoy the moment without overthinking everything.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! It’s vital to foster self-compassion. You've made great strides today towards improving your social confidence. I’m looking forward to hearing how the lunch turns out. Do remember, it’s all a learning process.

User: Thanks! I appreciate all the support. I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Ming! I believe in your ability to navigate these social situations. Keep practicing those skills, and we can regroup after the lunch to see how it went. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after speaking up in the meeting?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good. After I spoke in the meeting and got some positive feedback, I started to believe in my ability to express myself better at work. But I’m still a bit nervous about continuing to speak up.

Consultant: That's great to hear you received positive feedback and are feeling better about your expression skills! What do you think could help you manage that nervousness as you prepare for more opportunities to speak up?

User: I think if I can get used to it step by step, maybe through smaller conversations with colleagues, it might help. But I still worry about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're considering a gradual approach, which is a smart way to build confidence. Can you recall a recent small conversation that went well? What did you feel during and after that interaction?

User: There was a day when I shared my opinion during lunch, and my colleagues seemed interested. I felt relieved afterwards, but in the moment, I kept second-guessing myself.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way when you’re sharing your thoughts. That relief after the conversation shows that your contributions are valuable. What do you think about practicing some self-affirmations before these interactions to help reduce that second-guessing?

User: Self-affirmations? I haven’t tried that before. How would that work for me?

Consultant: Self-affirmations are positive statements that can reinforce your belief in your abilities. For example, you could remind yourself, "I can express my ideas clearly, and my opinions matter." Saying these to yourself before a conversation might help boost your confidence. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think that might help! Saying things like that to myself could change how I feel about speaking up. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It's a great way to challenge any negative thoughts you might have. Let’s work on some specific affirmations together that feel right for you. How about, “I am growing more confident in sharing my thoughts every day"?

User: That sounds good! I like the idea of focusing on growth rather than perfection.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. When you think about future meetings or conversations, what’s one specific situation you could prepare for using these affirmations?

User: There’s an upcoming team meeting where I need to present my ideas. I can use some affirmations before that.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! You can visualize yourself talking confidently while using the affirmations. Let’s also discuss how you can manage any lingering anxieties right before your presentation.

User: I often feel a rush of anxiety just before I start talking. I don’t want that to distract me.

Consultant: Anxiety can indeed be challenging. Let’s explore some grounding techniques you can use before speaking. For instance, taking deep breaths or even doing a brief physical exercise could help release some of that tension. How do you feel about trying that before your presentation?

User: I’ve never thought about physical exercise before speaking. It sounds like it could work!

Consultant: It can be a great way to reset your focus. You might also find it helpful to take a moment to scan the room and connect with friendly faces before you start. Who do you think you could look to for support in that moment?

User: I have a couple of colleagues who are always supportive. I could focus on them to ease the tension.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Connecting with supportive colleagues will definitely help. As you approach the meeting, remind yourself of the positive feedback you've received before. What do you think will help you remember that in the moment?

User: Maybe I could write down a few positive comments from my colleagues and keep them in front of me as a reminder.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Having those reminders visible can reinforce your confidence. Before we wrap up, what specific actions do you intend to take to prepare for the meeting?

User: I’ll write down my affirmations, some positive comments, and plan some breathing exercises. I think that covers it!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Li Ming! I’m excited for you to implement these strategies. Let’s review your progress in our next session and see how you feel afterward. Remember to celebrate each step you take. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel much more encouraged about the meeting now!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Ming! I'm confident in your ability to express yourself. Keep practicing those affirmations, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! It's great to have you here today. I'm looking forward to discussing your recent achievements and how we can build on that success. How are you feeling about everything right now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I've been getting a lot of positive feedback from my team after leading the recent project. It feels rewarding, but I also want to make sure I keep up the good work and improve my interactions with my colleagues.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've had a significant boost in your self-esteem and recognition from your peers. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your interactions with your colleagues you'd like to improve?

User: Well, I've noticed that while some relationships are good, I've had some tension with a few colleagues. I want to ensure that I handle those situations better and maintain the positive momentum I've built.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to want to maintain those positive relationships. Can you share a specific instance where you felt the tension, and what thoughts were running through your mind during that situation?

User: There was a meeting where one colleague was quite dismissive of my ideas. I felt frustrated and undervalued. I started thinking that maybe I wasn’t cut out for this leadership role after all.

Consultant: Your feelings of frustration and self-doubt are completely valid, especially in a moment like that. Let's try to unpack those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not suitable for this role?

User: I know I received good feedback, but when I faced that dismissive reaction, it made me question my capabilities. I tended to focus on that negative experience rather than my overall success.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize how easily our minds can latch onto negative feedback, even when there’s a contrast with positive experiences. Let’s explore this further. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell him about that meeting and his capabilities?

User: I’d probably say that one negative interaction doesn’t define his ability. It's important to look at the bigger picture and not let one opinion overshadow the support from the rest of the team.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It shows that you recognize the importance of context. Now, how can we apply that understanding to strengthen your confidence and improve those challenging interactions moving forward?

User: I think I need to remind myself of my accomplishments more often and not let negative comments hold so much weight. Plus, maybe I should proactively seek feedback from my team to better understand their perceptions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeking constructive feedback can greatly enhance your communication and relationships. Let’s develop an action plan together. What specific steps are you willing to take in the next week to practice this approach?

User: I could start by scheduling one-on-one check-ins with my colleagues to discuss any concerns and gather their input on our collaboration. And I’ll also take some time to reflect on my achievements and strengths before those conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Li Ming! Reflecting on your strengths is critical for maintaining your self-confidence. How do you feel about these upcoming conversations?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and a bit of anxiety. I want to ensure the interactions are constructive, but I’m hopeful that they will lead to better understanding.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious before having those conversations, especially when aiming for better outcomes. Let’s think of some strategies you can use to ease that anxiety—do you have any techniques that help you feel more grounded before a conversation?

User: Deep breathing helps me, and sometimes visualizing the conversation going positively calms my nerves. I may also prepare some key points I want to cover to stay focused.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Visualization and preparation can significantly boost your confidence. Let’s also consider how you can celebrate any progress you make during these interactions, no matter how small.

User: I could treat myself to a little reward after each successful conversation, like enjoying a favorite snack or spending time on a hobby.

Consultant: That sounds like a delightful way to reinforce the positive changes you're making! Reflecting on your progress and celebrating wins can motivate you further. How can we ensure that you're continuing to build on the growth you’ve experienced so far?

User: I guess I could keep a journal where I note down my progress and any successful interactions or feedback I receive. Reviewing that regularly might help maintain my momentum.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Li Ming! Journaling will allow you to visualize your growth and positive experiences, reinforcing your journey. What will you focus on as you reflect each week?

User: I want to focus on my interactions, the feedback I get, and how I handled challenges. I also want to note any successes, no matter how small, to keep a positive mindset.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful approach! Focusing on both challenges and successes will provide a balanced view and help you grow more resilient. Looking ahead, how do you envision your emotional state evolving as you continue to implement these strategies?

User: I hope to feel more confident and empowered in my role, and I want to enjoy my interactions with team members instead of feeling on edge. My goal is to feel capable of leading and contributing positively.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Li Ming. Feeling empowered and enjoying your role will undoubtedly enhance your overall satisfaction and performance. We can revisit your progress next time and ensure you're on track. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel really good! This conversation has helped me clarify my thoughts and create a plan. I’m excited to put everything into action.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It sounds like you have solid steps ahead of you. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out if you need support or want to share your progress. I look forward to hearing about your success in our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to our next meeting too!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Ming! Take care, and until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad you're back for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hello! I've been feeling quite positive, actually. I’ve gained more confidence at work and established better relationships with my colleagues. However, I still worry about maintaining this progress.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've made significant strides in your confidence and social interactions. Let’s explore your concerns about maintaining this progress. What specifically worries you about it?

User: I fear that if I don’t actively work on my relationships, the momentum will fade, and I’ll revert to feeling isolated again. I worry about not being able to sustain the connections I’ve built.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those feelings. Maintaining relationships can be challenging, especially when you’re trying to sustain recent positive changes. Can you share what steps you’ve been taking to nurture these connections?

User: I’ve been participating more in team activities and reaching out to my colleagues for lunch or coffee breaks. I feel that’s helped, but there’s a part of me that worries it might not be enough.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you’re actively engaging with your colleagues! That’s a crucial part of relationship building. Now, when you mention that it might not be enough, what thoughts come to mind? 

User: I sometimes think that maybe my efforts are superficial. I fear that my colleagues don’t genuinely like me or that I’ll be judged for my past struggles.

Consultant: It sounds like there are some underlying fears about judgment and authenticity in your relationships. Let’s delve into those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your colleagues may not genuinely like you?

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence. It’s just a feeling I have. I mean, I only started opening up to them recently. What if they don't accept my past?

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that feelings are not always reflective of reality. Since you’ve built connections by being active in social situations, perhaps your colleagues appreciate your efforts and see your growth. What would you tell a friend in your position who shared similar fears?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has a past and that being open about it is brave. But I guess it’s harder to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: Exactly. It’s often much easier to offer supportive advice to others than to ourselves. So how can you shift that perspective for your own situation? What would help you feel more secure about your relationships?

User: Maybe I could try being more open about my past. If I share my experiences, I might find that others relate, and it could strengthen those connections.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Opening up might indeed deepen your relationships. Are there any specific situations or conversations you can envision where you might feel comfortable sharing more about yourself?

User: Yes, there’s a team lunch coming up. I think I could share a little about my journey in overcoming some challenges I faced before starting in this company.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! Sharing your experiences can not only foster understanding but also allow your colleagues to relate to you. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel nervous but also excited about the possibility. I think it could help me connect with them on a deeper level.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about being vulnerable. However, that courage can indeed lead to stronger connections. What will you do to manage any anxiety that might arise during that lunch?

User: I could practice what I want to say beforehand or remind myself that everyone has their own struggles. That way, I can feel more prepared.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing beforehand can give you more confidence. And reminding yourself of common human experiences can provide comfort. How do you envision your mindset after sharing with your colleagues?

User: I hope I’ll feel relieved and more connected, knowing I opened up about something personal.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful goal! Feeling relieved and connected are valid outcomes. As we move forward, can we discuss how you can maintain the positive changes in your confidence and social life once this lunch is over?

User: Sure! I think regular check-ins with myself about my feelings and progress could help, along with continuing to engage with my colleagues.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular check-ins and continued engagement are key. Is there anything else you’d like to implement to further strengthen your relationships or personal development?

User: Maybe I should set small goals to reach out to different colleagues each week. That might help keep the connections alive.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Setting small, manageable goals can help you stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed. What other support systems do you think you might need to help sustain your progress?

User: I guess having open discussions about my experiences with friends outside of work could be beneficial too. So I can reflect on my growth.

Consultant: That’s a wise idea! Talking through your experiences with close friends can provide you with additional support and insight. As we wrap up, how do you feel about your journey and the steps you’ve planned?

User: I feel more optimistic! Discussing this has helped clarify my thoughts, and I’m looking forward to the team lunch.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you feel more optimistic! Reflecting on your progress and having a plan can really empower you. If you ever find challenges arise, remember the strategies and insights we've discussed. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate it. I feel better equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Ming! I’m confident that you have the tools to navigate your relationships positively. This will be our last session for now, but remember, you can always return if you need further support. Good luck with everything!

User: Thank you! I will remember that. Take care!
