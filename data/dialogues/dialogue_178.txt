Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite lost and disappointed. I had an interview with an advertising company that I really like, and I didn't get the position. It made me feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: I can understand how disappointing that must have been for you. It’s tough to feel that way, especially when you have hopes for your career. Let’s talk about your feelings during the interview. What thoughts crossed your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I just didn't look right or dress well for the occasion. I felt like that was why I failed. 

Consultant: It sounds like you linked your appearance and clothing directly to the outcome of the interview. When you thought that way, what emotions did that bring up for you?

User: I felt really embarrassed and anxious. I started doubting myself, thinking maybe I'm not cut out for this career at all.

Consultant: Doubting oneself can be really heavy to carry. It’s important to explore those feelings. What other thoughts do you recall having after the interview? 

User: I just couldn't shake off this feeling of failure. I kept wondering if I wasn’t talented enough or if I would ever find a job that fits me.

Consultant: It seems like those negative thoughts are weighing you down. Have you noticed if there are any specific patterns in how you think about yourself and your abilities?

User: Yeah, I often feel like I'm not as good as others. Like my classmates are more talented and have better opportunities. I feel stuck.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck is quite common, especially when compared with others. What would you say are some strengths or talents you have, even if you find it hard to see them right now?

User: Well, I’ve always been good at drawing. Some say my art is creative, but I don't know if that will help me in finding a job.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strength, Li! Creativity is highly valued in many fields, especially advertising. Have you thought about how you might incorporate your drawing skills into a career path?

User: I guess I haven’t. I’ve mostly focused on what I lack instead of what I can offer.

Consultant: Recognizing that is an important step! Can we explore together how your artistic talent might open doors for you? For instance, could you consider roles in advertising that involve creative design or illustrations?

User: That makes sense. I could look for internships or projects where I can use my drawing skills, but I'm just not sure where to start.

Consultant: We can definitely brainstorm that together! What about reaching out to local businesses or online platforms where you could showcase your artwork? 

User: I’ve never done that before. I’m scared of rejection again.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Let’s think about this: if a friend of yours felt the same way, what would you advise them to do? 

User: I would say they should try anyway because they might find opportunities they never expected.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s commendable that you can provide support to others. Sometimes, applying that same kindness and encouragement to ourselves can help diminish those fears. How can you start taking those small steps?

User: Maybe I could create an online portfolio and start sharing my drawings? 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! By creating a portfolio, you can showcase your talent and potentially connect with opportunities that align with your skills. What thoughts do you have about starting that?

User: I think I could give it a try. It feels less intimidating when I think of it as just sharing my work. 

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective, Li! Remember, each small step counts, and it’s okay to take your time. How do you feel about focusing on this goal in our coming sessions?

User: I feel more hopeful. Although I'm still scared, I think it’s a step in the right direction. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we continue, we can work together to build your confidence and tackle those fears as they arise. What do you think is the next most pressing thing we should address in your journey?

User: I need to work on reducing my anxiety when applying for jobs or going to interviews. 

Consultant: Absolutely, managing that anxiety is key. We can explore some strategies together in the next session to help you feel calmer and more prepared. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me! I feel like I’m starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

Consultant: That's a wonderful feeling to have, Li! Remember, it’s all about progress. I look forward to hearing more about your journey and the steps you take until we meet again. 

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best to work on it. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, you’re not alone on this path. Take care, and until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down about my job search. I tried applying for a customer service position at a hotel, but I didn't get it. It really made me doubt my abilities and made me feel like I won't find a good job.

Consultant: I understand that this experience has been quite discouraging for you. It sounds like it's impacting your self-esteem quite a bit. Can you share more about what thoughts went through your mind when you found out you didn't get the job?

User: I just thought that maybe I'm not good enough for anything. I feel like everyone around me is succeeding, and I'm stuck in this situation. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and comparing yourself to others. Let's take a moment to think about some of those thoughts. When you tell yourself, "I'm not good enough," what emotions does that create for you?

User: It makes me feel really sad and hopeless. I just don't see a way out of this. I feel lost.

Consultant: Feeling lost can indeed be overwhelming. I want us to explore those thoughts together. Can you identify any specific situations or evidence that support the idea that you are not good enough?

User: Well, for the job interviews I've had recently, I just felt out of place. I stumbled over my words and could hardly answer their questions.

Consultant: It sounds like those experiences were really challenging for you. However, it's important to recognize that stumbling in an interview doesn't define your worth or abilities. What if we reframe those moments? What can you learn from them?

User: I guess I could work on my interview skills. But even then, I wonder if I have any skills that make me stand out.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiaoli! Identifying skills is an important step. Let's think about your strengths in a broader sense. What are some things you feel you do well, whether in school, hobbies, or even life experiences?

User: I'm really good at drawing, and I've always been told I have talent in art. But it feels like that doesn’t help me with finding a job.

Consultant: Drawing is a wonderful skill and a form of expression. Have you considered how you might use your artistic talent in a career path? For example, graphic design or illustration could merge your interest with potential job opportunities.

User: I haven't really thought about it. I always focused more on getting a stable job, like the hotel position. 

Consultant: It makes sense to seek stability, especially given your background. However, it's also valuable to explore paths that align with your passions. What would it feel like to consider a career that incorporates your love for drawing?

User: That actually sounds exciting but also a bit scary. I’m not sure if I could succeed in that area.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared when considering a new direction. Can we explore what success looks like for you in that area? What small steps might you take to learn more about it?

User: Maybe I could take some online courses in graphic design. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Taking small steps towards your interests can be empowering. As you explore this option, how do you think it might affect your self-perception and confidence?

User: I think it could help me see that I have skills that are worthwhile. But I’m worried about failing again.

Consultant: That worry is understandable, especially given your recent experiences. What if we challenge that thought? Can you think of any times in your life when you've tried something new and succeeded, even in a small way?

User: Well, I remember when I first started drawing. I was bad at it, but I kept practicing, and eventually, I improved.

Consultant: That's a fantastic example! It shows that with practice and perseverance, you can grow and improve in any area. Embracing a growth mindset can change how you approach both drawing and job searching. 

User: I see that. Maybe I should remind myself of that when I feel discouraged.

Consultant: Yes! Keeping a journal of your progress and reminders of your achievements could be beneficial as well. It would be a way to reinforce your strengths and potential. How do you feel about starting that?

User: I think that could help me. It feels good to talk about this. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Reflecting on positives can help shift your mindset over time. As we wrap up today, what steps do you feel ready to take before our next session?

User: I’m going to research online courses and start a journal about my feelings and progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain. You've already taken a brave step by being here. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoli! You're starting to recognize your strengths and potential. I believe in you, and I'm here to support you along your journey. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! Welcome to our session today. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear about how you've been feeling lately and what's been on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about myself recently, especially with my art skills. But I'm still really anxious about the future and my career. It feels overwhelming, especially after those unsuccessful interviews.

Consultant: I see, so you're experiencing a mix of hope from your artistic pursuits and anxiety about your career prospects. That’s completely understandable. Could you share a little more about what you envision for your career and what aspects are causing you the most anxiety?

User: I really want to do something creative, maybe as an illustrator or in digital art. But every time I think about applying for jobs, I doubt my abilities. It's hard to see a clear path forward.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a strong passion for creativity, but there's also a barrier of self-doubt when it comes to pursuing those opportunities. Let's explore this a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about applying for these jobs?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough, and that I'll never succeed in this field. Those thoughts just make me want to give up.

Consultant: That’s quite a heavy thought to carry, feeling that you're not good enough. Let's take a moment to unpack that. What evidence do you have that suggests you won't succeed? 

User: Well, I've had a few interviews that didn't go well, and I guess that makes me believe I won't find anything good.

Consultant: It’s certainly tough to face those setbacks. However, can we look at those experiences differently? What did you learn from those interviews that could help you in the future?

User: I suppose I learned that I need to prepare better and maybe practice my portfolio presentation. But it still feels like a lot to handle.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoli! Recognizing areas for improvement is a positive step. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, maybe we could set some smaller goals for your preparation? What’s one thing you could do this week to improve your confidence for the next opportunity?

User: I could spend some time refining my portfolio and practicing how I present my work. That seems manageable.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a perfect plan. Focusing on small, actionable steps can help reduce anxiety. How do you feel about tackling that this week?

User: It feels a bit less daunting now that I've broken it down. I think I can do it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, progress often comes in small steps. As you work on that, let’s also think about how you can build your confidence in job settings. What are some situations where you feel comfortable expressing yourself?

User: When I'm with friends or sharing my art online, I feel more confident. But in formal settings like interviews, it’s really hard.

Consultant: That's an excellent observation. It’s helpful to recognize where you're more at ease. Perhaps we can use those comfortable situations as practice for more formal ones. How about trying to present your art to friends as if it were an interview scenario? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. It would help me get used to talking about my work in front of others.

Consultant: Exactly! It's a great way to practice and build your confidence gradually. In the meantime, let’s discuss how you can manage the anxiety that arises before interviews. What relaxation techniques have you tried so far?

User: I haven't really tried anything, to be honest. I usually just feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but let's explore some techniques that could help you manage that anxiety. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises or visualizing a positive outcome before an interview?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I’ve never actually done it.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective in calming the mind. It’s simple—just take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold for four, and then breathe out for a count of four. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Sure, that might be nice.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s do it together. (Pause for deep breathing exercise) Great job! How do you feel after that exercise?

User: I do feel a bit lighter. Thanks, that was helpful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, incorporating such techniques into your routine can help you manage anxiety more effectively. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize our progress. You’ve identified actionable steps for your portfolio, practiced presenting your work in a comfortable setting, and learned some relaxation techniques. 

User: Yes, it feels like I have a plan now, and that makes me feel better.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Before our next session, I encourage you to implement these strategies and observe how they affect your confidence and anxiety. What do you think your biggest takeaway from today has been?

User: I think it's that I can take small steps to manage my anxiety and that preparing can help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiaoli. As you navigate through your career journey, remember that it’s okay to feel anxious—it’s part of the learning process. If you encounter any challenges, know that we can talk about them next time. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress!

User: Thank you so much! I'm feeling hopeful about working on my goals now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoli! I'm here to support you on this journey. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. Have a great week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! It's great to see you again. I know you've been working on expanding your social connections. How have things been going for you lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more active socially. I joined a painting club last week, but I felt so nervous during the first meeting. I didn’t know how to start conversations with others, and I ended up not talking much.

Consultant: It sounds like joining the painting club was a big step for you, even if it felt intimidating. What were some of the thoughts you had when you found it difficult to start conversations?

User: I kept thinking that nobody would want to talk to me or that I’d embarrass myself if I said something silly. It made me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely be overwhelming. Let’s explore this a bit. What kind of feelings did those thoughts create for you during the meeting?

User: I felt really anxious and isolated, almost like I didn’t belong there. I just wanted to leave.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a new social setting. Do you think these thoughts were based on any past experiences or fears you've had about social situations?

User: Yes, I often feel like I don’t fit in, especially since I’m not as outgoing as others. I remember struggling to make friends in high school, and sometimes those memories come back to me.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like old feelings are being triggered in these new situations. If you were to challenge those thoughts, like questioning whether they’re entirely accurate or based on evidence, what might you come up with?

User: I guess not everyone knows each other right away. Maybe some of them are also looking for friends, just like me. But it’s still hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: That's a great realization! It sounds like there might be a different perspective to consider. How about we think of a small, manageable experiment that you could try at the next meeting? For instance, preparing a simple introduction or a question to ask someone. What do you think?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could say something like, “Hey, I really like your painting style. How did you get into painting?” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a wonderful opener. By starting with a compliment or question, you’re also showing interest in others, which can help ease the pressure. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. I just hope I don’t freeze up when the time comes.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. If you do freeze, you can take a deep breath and remind yourself of your goal to connect. Can we also talk about how you might follow up after the initial comment?

User: Maybe I could ask more about their painting? Like, what inspires them, or what they like to paint?

Consultant: Yes, those are excellent follow-up questions! This kind of conversation can help you build rapport. After trying this at the next meetup, let’s reflect on how it went. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll definitely give it a try. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, it’s all a part of the learning process. How can you support yourself after the meeting, regardless of how things go?

User: I could write down how I felt and what worked or didn’t work after talking to someone. That way, I can figure out how to improve for next time.

Consultant: That's a brilliant approach! Reflecting on your experiences will help you grow more comfortable over time. Is there anything else on your mind related to this, or perhaps something else you’d like to discuss today?

User: I think I've covered what’s been bothering me lately. I really want to see progress in my social skills.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, and you’re already on the right track! As we continue, we’ll focus on building your confidence and skills. Before we end today, let’s remind ourselves of the positive steps you’ve taken so far. What stands out to you?

User: Joining the painting club is a big step for me. And I’m really proud that I’m trying to face my fears.

Consultant: You should be proud! It takes courage to step out of your comfort zone. Now, as we wrap up, let’s think about how you can maintain this momentum. What strategies could you use to keep feeling encouraged?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing my conversations and give myself credit for each small step, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Recognizing your efforts is key to boosting your self-efficacy. I believe you have what it takes to navigate these social situations confidently. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better after our session. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoli. You've made significant progress. Let’s keep working together to build on these skills. Remember, I’m here for you if you need support in the future. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I’m glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a lot more confident lately. I’ve met some new friends that really understand me, and I’m starting to feel more positive about my future.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear you've found supportive friends and are feeling more confident. Can you tell me more about what changes you've noticed in yourself recently?

User: I think I’m more open to opportunities now. Even though my internship is not what I wanted, I feel like I can learn something from it rather than just seeing it as a failure.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your thinking! Instead of seeing the internship as a setback, recognizing it as a learning opportunity is really empowering. How does this new perspective make you feel about approaching your goals?

User: It feels refreshing! I’m not as overwhelmed as before. I’ve started to think about what I actually want to do after graduation and what steps I can take to get there.

Consultant: Fantastic! You’re taking proactive steps towards your future. What specific goals or actions are you considering to help you move forward?

User: I want to build my portfolio with more of my art and maybe look for part-time work related to it. I’m also thinking of attending some local art events to network.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent plans! Building your portfolio and networking can really open up new opportunities for you in the art field. What steps have you already taken towards these goals?

User: I’ve started gathering my artwork and picking my favorites. I also went to an art fair last weekend and met a few artists, which was exciting!

Consultant: Meeting artists at the fair sounds like a wonderful experience! It’s great that you’re exposing yourself to more of these opportunities. How did you feel during that event?

User: I felt a bit nervous at first, but once I started talking to them, I realized I could relate to their experiences. It made me feel more at ease.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous in new situations, but it’s encouraging to hear that you connected with them. Building connections can be valuable for your growth. What do you think you can do next to keep building this momentum?

User: I think I’ll keep reaching out to people I meet and maybe ask for feedback on my art. It would help me grow and feel more connected.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Seeking feedback can provide insight and enhance your development. What kind of feedback are you hoping to receive, and from whom?

User: I’d like to get honest opinions from fellow artists about my style and technique. I want to know what works and what doesn’t.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Constructive feedback can help you refine your skills and build your confidence further. How do you plan to approach your interactions with these artists?

User: I think I’ll start by complimenting their work and then ask for tips. I hope that opens up a conversation.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Complimenting their work can make the conversation more comfortable. As you engage with them, how do you think you’ll handle any constructive criticism you might receive?

User: I want to remain open to it. I know it’s meant to help me improve, so I’ll try not to take it too personally.

Consultant: That’s a healthy attitude! Viewing constructive criticism as a tool for improvement is important. Remember, everyone receives feedback, and it’s a part of growth. Do you anticipate any challenges in implementing this approach?

User: Maybe the fear of rejection or not being good enough will creep in again. But I think I can manage it better now.

Consultant: Acknowledging that fear is an important step. Since you've been working on your confidence, let's talk about strategies you can use when those feelings arise. What strategies have worked for you in the past?

User: I usually take deep breaths and remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received before. That helps!

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful technique! It can ground you in the moment. Additionally, reinforcing positive thoughts can shift your focus from fear to confidence. Would you like to explore some new techniques to cope with anxiety in social situations?

User: Yes, I’d love to! I think it would help strengthen my confidence even more.

Consultant: One technique could be visualization. Picture a situation where you’re successfully engaging with other artists and receiving positive feedback. How do you think visualizing that outcome might affect your mindset?

User: I think it would help me feel more prepared and less anxious. It sounds like a powerful tool.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualization can create a sense of familiarity and increase your confidence. You might try this technique before your next social event. How do you feel about practicing visualization regularly?

User: I think incorporating it into my routine would be great! It seems manageable and beneficial.

Consultant: That’s a proactive step! As we wrap up our session today, let's summarize what you've accomplished and the steps you'll take moving forward. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from today?

User: I realize I have the power to shape my future and that I’m not alone in this journey. I can connect with others and learn from them.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiao Li! You have indeed made significant progress in your confidence and outlook. What strategies will you implement next week to further your growth?

User: I’ll practice visualization, reach out to new artists, and keep building my portfolio. I feel excited about these steps!

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! You’ve clearly identified actionable steps, and I believe in your ability to carry them out. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. If you encounter challenges, feel free to share them in our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel much more optimistic about everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Li! I’m proud of you for the progress you’ve made and how you’ve embraced this journey. Looking forward to our next session and hearing about your experiences. Take care until then!

User: You too! I’ll see you next time!
