Consultant: Hello, Lanlan! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I don't know... things have been tough. I've been feeling really low, especially after my fight with Susu. I'm just really confused and upset.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like the conflict with Susu has really affected you. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind and how this situation has impacted your emotions?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I shouldn't have let things get so bad. Now I feel like I've lost a friend and it hurts. Sometimes, I just want to give up and I don’t see the point of anything anymore.

Consultant: It sounds really painful to feel like you've lost someone important in your life. It's understandable to feel that way given the circumstances. Can you share what kind of thoughts come to your mind when you think about this friendship with Susu?

User: I think maybe she doesn't care about me anymore, and it makes me feel worthless. I keep replaying our fight in my head, and I wish I could go back and change things.

Consultant: Those thoughts are really tough to carry, especially when they heighten your feelings of worthlessness. Can you remember if there are any specific emotions you feel when you think about your friendship with Susu and the fight?

User: I feel really sad and angry. Sad that it happened and angry at both her and myself for letting it go this far.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have mixed emotions like sadness and anger in situations like this. Let's try to identify some of the negative thoughts that are coming up for you. When you think about feeling worthless, how does that thought make you feel in your body?

User: I feel heavy and tired, like I just want to stay in bed. And then the anger just turns into tears.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, feeling heavy and then having those tears come out. It's a lot to manage. When you're in those moments of feeling heavy or sad, what are some of the automatic thoughts that pop up?

User: It's like I tell myself, “No one will want to be my friend” or “I'm not good enough.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh. Let's take a moment to challenge them. Is there any evidence that supports those thoughts? Have you had friends in the past who valued your company?

User: I guess I have had friends who cared... but right now it just feels like nobody does.

Consultant: I understand. Our emotions can cloud our perception of reality. If a friend was in your situation and feeling this way, what would you tell them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that they’re not alone, and it’s okay to feel sad, but they also have people who care about them. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Why not try to apply that kindness to yourself? You deserve the same level of understanding. What if we could find ways to connect with those who care about you, like your mother or even other friends?

User: I don’t know... talking to my mom just makes me feel guilty because she’s already dealing with so much.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but sharing your feelings might actually help both of you feel better. You might be surprised by how she reacts. What are your thoughts on discussing your feelings with her?

User: Maybe it could help... I just don’t want to add to her stress.

Consultant: That’s a caring thought, but sometimes sharing our struggles can lighten our load and strengthen our bond. If you decided to talk to her, how would you begin this conversation?

User: I could start by just telling her I’ve been feeling down. I think she would listen.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! You know, acknowledging your feelings with someone close can provide relief and understanding. Now, let’s take a moment to address your feelings towards Susu. What do you believe could be a way to rebuild or repair that relationship, if you’re open to it?

User: I think I could apologize and try to explain my side, but I’m scared she won’t listen.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel scared. But expressing your feelings may be a step towards healing. If Susu responded positively, how would that make you feel?

User: I guess it would feel good to mend things. I’d feel less lonely.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Lanlan. Fostering connections can be an essential part of healing. As we wrap up today, what’s one small action you think you could take before our next session to address this situation with either your mom or Susu?

User: I could write down what I want to say to my mom first. It might help me organize my thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. Writing can provide clarity and make conversations easier. Remember, it’s a step forward, and you’re doing your best. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel a little more hopeful about it. Thank you for listening.

Consultant: Of course, Lanlan. I’m here for you. It’s a journey, and recognizing your feelings is crucial. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Lanlan! I'm glad to see you again. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. I feel a bit overwhelmed. After my fallout with Susu, I’ve been thinking a lot about our friendship, and it’s really hard for me. 

Consultant: I can hear that this situation with Susu is weighing heavily on you. Would you like to share more about what happened between you two?

User: We used to be really close, but then we had a big argument about something really silly. I just miss how things were before, but I’m afraid to reach out to her.

Consultant: It sounds like you really value your friendship with Susu and miss the connection you had. What are some feelings you experience when you think about reaching out to her?

User: I feel anxious and worried. I’m scared she might not want to talk to me, or that I’ll mess things up again.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and fear are completely understandable, given the situation. Let’s explore this a bit more—what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about reaching out to her?

User: I keep thinking she’s going to be really angry with me or that she’ll tell everyone what happened. It makes me want to hide instead of facing it.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are making you feel trapped. Can we take a moment to assess the evidence behind those thoughts? What’s the likelihood of those things actually happening?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. We were friends for a long time, and I think she also misses me. But still, the fear feels so real.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s common for fears to feel overwhelming even if the evidence suggests otherwise. If you were to give advice to a friend in your situation, what might you suggest they do?

User: I would probably tell them to be brave and talk to the friend, to clear things up. But it’s harder to do it myself.

Consultant: That’s a very wise perspective! Let’s consider how you might apply that advice to your own situation. What small step could you take that feels manageable to reach out to Susu?

User: Maybe I could send her a text to ask if we can talk. That feels a little less scary than confronting her in person right away.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Sending a text allows you to ease into the conversation. How do you feel about drafting a message together?

User: That would help! I want to make sure it sounds okay.

Consultant: Let’s think about what you want to say. You could start with something like, "Hey Susu, I’ve been thinking about our friendship and would love to talk if you’re open to it." How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! It feels casual but sincere. I want her to know I care.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, reaching out is an important step. How do you feel now about sending that text?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I still have some nerves, but it’s nice to have a plan.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous! Once you send the message, how might you handle any response she gives?

User: I guess I could try to stay calm and listen to what she has to say, even if it’s not what I hope to hear.

Consultant: That’s a resilient approach! Staying calm and open to her feelings will help in repairing your friendship. How do you think you would manage your emotions if her response is different from what you wish for?

User: I might feel sad, but I’ll try to remind myself that it’s just part of the process, and I can handle it.

Consultant: That’s a very healthy mindset. Recognizing that it’s a process will help maintain your emotional balance. Let’s touch on your feelings about home as well. How do you feel about the situation with your family right now?

User: I often feel frustrated. My mom works a lot, and I don’t get to talk to her about how I feel. It makes me feel lonely sometimes.

Consultant: I can see how that might be difficult for you. Feeling lonely when you want support can be very painful. Would you like to explore ways to communicate your feelings to your mom?

User: I want to, but I worry she might not understand. I don’t want to burden her more.

Consultant: It’s considerate of you to think about her feelings, but it’s also essential for you to express your needs. How about starting with something simple, like talking about your day and gradually sharing how you feel?

User: That sounds doable! I could start by asking her how her day was too. 

Consultant: That’s a nice approach! It creates a two-way conversation. Let’s think about how you might express your feelings about your friendship with Susu to your mom as well.

User: I could tell her I’m sad about it and that I’m trying to fix things. Maybe she can help me think things through.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing your feelings with her could provide the support you need. How do you feel about these steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It helps to have a plan for both Susu and my mom. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re taking important steps toward improving your relationships. Let's perhaps review some of your progress next time, and keep working on these strategies. 

User: I’d like that. Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lanlan! I’m proud of the steps you’re willing to take. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lanlan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with everything that's been going on?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to rebuild my relationship with Susu, but I feel so confused about the future. I also worry about my mom and her emotional life. It all seems overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotions regarding your friendships and family. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings come up when you think about your relationship with Susu and your mom?

User: I really care about Susu, and I want to feel close to her again. But I’m afraid she might not want the same. With my mom, I just feel uncertain about how she’s coping and if she’ll be okay without Dad. It makes me feel helpless.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially given the changes in your life. You mentioned feeling helpless; can you describe how that feeling affects your daily life or your interactions with others?

User: When I feel helpless, I just want to shut down. I don’t always want to talk to my friends or even my sister. I get worried that they won’t understand what I’m going through, so I just keep everything inside.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re holding a lot in and feeling disconnected from those who care about you. When you think about sharing your feelings with them, what thoughts or worries come to mind?

User: I worry they won’t take me seriously or that I’ll burden them with my problems. It feels easier to keep quiet, but then I end up feeling even more alone.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in, feeling alone while also wanting to connect. What if we explore some practical ways to express your feelings to your friends and family? How does that sound to you?

User: I guess that could help. I want to feel closer to them, but I’m just not sure how to start talking about it.

Consultant: We can work on that together. One way might be to share a small part of what you're feeling, maybe focusing on your friendship with Susu. What kind of statement could you make to show her that you want to reconnect while being honest about how you feel?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "I’ve missed you and I’m a bit confused about where we stand." That sounds okay, right?

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! It opens the door for a conversation. How do you feel about taking that step and reaching out to her?

User: I feel nervous, but it also sounds nice to talk it out. I wish things would feel easier.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous before such conversations, but taking small steps can often lead to positive outcomes. Let’s think about what support you might need from a friend or a sibling before you reach out to Susu. 

User: I think talking to my sister first might help. She’s been through tough times too, so maybe she'd understand how I feel.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. Talking to someone who has a similar experience can offer you comfort. How might you approach that conversation with your sister?

User: I could say, "Can we talk? I’m feeling a bit frustrated about some things and could use your advice."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express your need for support. Once you’ve talked to her and possibly shared your feelings, how do you think that might change your feelings of isolation?

User: I think it might help me feel less alone and more hopeful. If she understands, it’ll be easier to talk to Susu, I think.

Consultant: Exactly! Opening up can be a pathway to feeling supported, and it can foster understanding within your relationships. Should we explore any specific worries about your mom’s emotional life that are particularly troubling you?

User: Yes, I sometimes worry that she’s not handling Dad’s death well. I see her working so hard, and I just wish she would talk to me about how she feels.

Consultant: Feeling concerned about your mother’s well-being is very caring of you. Have you thought about asking her directly how she’s coping?

User: I’ve thought about it, but I’m scared she might just brush me off or not want to talk.

Consultant: That fear is understandable, but by expressing your concern, you’re showing her that you really care. You might say something like, "Mom, I’ve noticed you’ve been working a lot. How are you feeling?" How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! It feels less direct and gives her room to share if she wants to.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! It's a gentle way to open the door for communication. After you have these interactions, how do you think you’ll feel about your own emotions?

User: I hope I’ll feel a bit lighter if I can share with them. Holding everything in just feels like too much sometimes.

Consultant: Sharing can indeed lighten that emotional load. Over time, you’ve mentioned wanting to enhance your self-worth. How do you feel you could build that along with improving your family and friendship connections?

User: I guess by recognizing that I’m trying my best and that it’s okay to ask for help. Making small steps could mean a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely, recognizing your efforts is a vital part of building self-esteem. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. Before we conclude our session, what’s one takeaway you feel you can apply right away?

User: I think reaching out to my sister first is a good immediate step. That feels like something I can actually do.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Taking that step will help reinforce your connections and may lead to a deeper understanding of yourself along the way. You’re making progress, and I’m proud of you for that. Next time, we can discuss how those conversations went and any new feelings that might come up.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful and ready to try. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Lanlan. I'm glad to hear you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I look forward to our next session together. Take care!

User: Bye, see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lanlan! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus on the positive aspects of my life, but sometimes, I still feel pretty low about myself. It's hard to shake off those feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re working hard to recognize the positive, and that’s an important step. Can you share more about what specific aspects you've started to appreciate?

User: Well, I've noticed that my family is trying to support me more. My mom has been really encouraging, and I have a couple of friends who have reached out too, which makes me feel a bit better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having supportive people around you can make a big difference. How does their support affect your feelings about yourself?

User: It helps a bit, but I still don’t feel worthy of their support. I keep thinking they must just feel sorry for me.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way, especially when dealing with difficult emotions. What if we tried to explore those thoughts? What evidence do you have that leads you to believe they feel sorry for you?

User: I don’t know... Maybe it’s just how I see it. I guess I worry that they won’t want to be around me if I keep struggling.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those worries. Let’s challenge that thought together. What do you think a friend would say if they knew you were feeling this way? 

User: They would probably tell me that it's okay to struggle and that they value me for who I am, not just my problems.

Consultant: Exactly! They appreciate you as a whole person. Let’s try to reframe your thinking. What positive qualities do you see in yourself that make you deserving of their support?

User: I try to be a good friend, and I think I’m kind. I want to be there for them too.

Consultant: Those are lovely qualities, Lanlan! Being kind and supportive are wonderful traits that contribute to friendships. How can you remind yourself of these qualities when those negative thoughts creep back in?

User: Maybe I could write them down somewhere or say them to myself more often. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Positive self-talk can help strengthen your self-esteem. How about we come up with a few affirmations together that you can use?

User: Sure! Like "I am kind" and "I am deserving of love." 

Consultant: Those are perfect! You can use them as daily reminders. Additionally, how do you feel about your relationship with your family now, after our last discussion?

User: I think it's getting better. My mom and I talk more openly, but I still get scared sometimes about how they'll react.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that communication is improving! What makes you feel scared about their reactions?

User: I’m afraid of burdening them. I don’t want them to worry about me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. What if you expressed this fear to them? It might help to share how you feel and ask for their thoughts.

User: I think I could try! It seems like it would help both me and them understand each other better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Open communication could foster stronger bonds. How can you prepare yourself for that conversation?

User: I could plan out what I want to say and maybe write it down. It might make it less scary.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Organizing your thoughts can ease anxiety. Also, remember that it’s okay to feel vulnerable. It shows strength to express your feelings. 

User: Yeah, I really want to be open with them. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re taking important steps. Let’s reflect on your progress today. What do you feel is your biggest achievement since we started our sessions?

User: I think I’m starting to believe that I can improve my self-image and my relationships.

Consultant: That’s huge, Lanlan! Acknowledging your growth is critical. How can you continue to maintain this progress in the coming weeks?

User: I’ll keep practicing my affirmations and talking openly with my mom and friends. 

Consultant: Excellent! It helps not only your self-esteem but also your relationships. Moving forward, are there specific situations you’re worried about that might challenge your progress?

User: I’m nervous about returning to school after break. I hope I don’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel apprehensive. What strategies can we develop now to help you feel more prepared for that return?

User: I could focus on using my affirmations before school and maybe set small goals for each day to make it less overwhelming.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Setting small, achievable goals can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and ease. Would it be helpful for you to have a plan for how to implement these affirmations and goals?

User: Yes! I’ll try to write specific goals every Sunday for the week. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Having a clear plan will give you structure and clarity. Before we summarize today, how are you feeling about the future and your journey now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I can see ways to improve, even if it’s going to take time.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Remember, it’s a journey, and each step matters. Let’s wrap up by reviewing what we’ve achieved today and the strategies we’ve put in place.

User: I’ve acknowledged my positive qualities, planned my affirmations, and talked about being open with my family. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made wonderful progress. Continue using your affirmations and reach out for support when you need it. I believe you have the strength to keep moving forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that our sessions are here to support you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Lanlan! Keep being kind to yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss your progress. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lanlan! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm doing okay, I guess. I still have my ups and downs, but I’ve been trying some new activities, like joining a book club at school. It feels a bit less scary to connect with others now.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step forward! Joining a book club shows your courage to interact in a new environment. What has been your experience with it so far?

User: It's been nice! I enjoy talking about books, and it helps that we all share a common interest. But sometimes, I still feel nervous before going.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in new situations, even when they seem positive. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel nervous before these meetings?

User: I worry that I won’t fit in or that I won’t know what to say. Sometimes, I think they might judge me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging to manage. It sounds like there might be some worries about how others perceive you. Can we explore what thoughts run through your mind just before going to the club?

User: I often think, “What if I embarrass myself?” or “What if no one likes me?” These thoughts make me hesitate a lot.

Consultant: Let's take a deeper look at those thoughts. How likely do you think it is that something embarrassing will happen? Do you have any evidence from your experiences that supports these beliefs?

User: Well, I haven't embarrassed myself yet, but I just can’t shake off that feeling. It feels very real to me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when we have worries about fitting in. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them to help them challenge those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their own insecurities and it's okay to feel nervous. I might also remind them that it’s about enjoying the activity, not just about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! You have some great insights. It sounds like you already understand that everyone has their own struggles. How might you apply that perspective to your own situation before the meetings?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone is just there to enjoy the books, and they probably feel nervous too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach, Lanlan! Remembering that others share similar feelings can be very comforting. Would you be willing to try this thinking next time before your book club?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels empowering to think that way.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way! Additionally, since you’re applying these techniques, would you like to set a small goal for your next meeting?

User: Maybe I can try to share my thoughts on the book we read, even if I'm nervous?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! Sharing your thoughts could help reinforce your confidence. How do you plan to approach it?

User: I can prepare a few points in advance so I feel more ready. I’ll remind myself that it’s a safe space.

Consultant: That's a brilliant strategy! Preparation can really help reduce anxiety. As we discuss this, how are you feeling about the upcoming meeting now?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed about it. Thinking of it as a shared space makes me less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great shift! Building a supportive mindset can really enhance your confidence. Let’s also talk about the support system you have in place—how are your friends and family responding to your involvement in these activities?

User: My friends have been really encouraging, and my mom is proud of me for stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having a supportive network is crucial. How do you think you might use their encouragement in future situations?

User: I could ask them to join me sometimes or share how I’m feeling before the meetings. It might help to have someone there.

Consultant: Absolutely, involving them could make your experience even more enjoyable. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve recognized your feelings, set a goal, and prepared strategies for your next meeting. What do you think is the biggest takeaway for you?

User: I think my biggest realization is that it’s okay to feel nervous and that I can challenge those negative thoughts. It's also okay to lean on my friends for support.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight, Lanlan! Embracing your feelings while also challenging them is a big step. Keep reminding yourself of these strategies. As we conclude today, what's one action you'll take this week to reinforce your confidence further?

User: I’ll prepare my thoughts for the next book club and remind myself of the positive aspects of connecting with others.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, you can come back anytime you feel the need to talk. Keep up the great work!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lanlan! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like I’ve been doing a bit better. My emotions have calmed down a lot, and I’m getting used to my social rhythm again. I’ve even joined some school activities.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s good to hear that you’re easing into social situations. Can you tell me more about the activities you’ve joined and how they’ve impacted your feelings?

User: I joined the art club and a volleyball team. Art helps me express myself, and volleyball has been a fun way to meet people. I still feel a bit anxious sometimes, especially in crowded places.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to know that you’re finding enjoyment in those activities. It's completely normal to still feel some anxiety in crowded situations. How do you usually cope when you start feeling that anxiety?

User: Well, I try to take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to feel uneasy. Sometimes, I just step outside for a bit until I feel calmer.

Consultant: Those are great strategies, Lanlan! Deep breathing can really help ground you. Since you're progressing positively, how would you like to tackle your anxiety in crowded places moving forward?

User: I guess I’d like to learn how to feel less overwhelmed and enjoy those moments more, instead of feeling like I want to escape.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! Let’s explore some techniques that could help you feel more comfortable. Would you be open to gradually exposing yourself to crowded situations with some coping strategies in place?

User: Yes, I think that could help! I just usually avoid those situations.

Consultant: Understandably so. Let’s create a step-by-step plan. What’s a situation that feels manageable for you right now regarding exposure to crowds?

User: Maybe I could try going to a school event for a short time. I feel comfortable enough with my friends around.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Attending a school event with your friends can provide both support and a sense of community. How might you prepare for that event to feel more comfortable?

User: I could remind myself to breathe deeply and maybe have a friend with me to talk to if I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Those sound like effective preparations! Having a friend by your side can make a significant difference. What do you think would be a good time to try this out?

User: There’s a school fair coming up next week. I think I might want to go there for a bit.

Consultant: Perfect! Mark that on your calendar. Let’s also discuss what to do if you start feeling anxious during the fair. What are some strategies you might use in that moment?

User: I could step away for a moment and practice my breathing, or just find a quieter place for a bit. 

Consultant: Those strategies are very sensible. Having a plan will empower you to manage your feelings as they come up. How do you feel about taking this step at the fair?

User: I feel nervous but also excited. I think it’ll be a good chance to practice what we talked about.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both nervous and excited. Remember, it’s a process, and each small step counts. After the fair, we can talk about how it went and what you learned from the experience.

User: Okay, that sounds good! I want to make the most out of it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s also briefly touch on how your relationships with your mother and sister have been lately. How do you feel about those connections now?

User: They’ve been much better. We talk more openly, and I feel like they understand me better.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Open communication can strengthen those bonds. Are there any particular conversations or moments that stood out to you recently?

User: Yes, my sister and I talked about our feelings one evening. It felt nice to share and support each other.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant breakthrough for both of you. It’s vital to have that support system, especially after everything you’ve been through. 

User: I agree. I feel really grateful for them.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you recognize and appreciate their support. As we move forward, let’s ensure you continue to nurture these connections while also focusing on your individual growth. 

User: Yes, definitely. I want to be the best version of myself.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! As we conclude today’s session, let’s reflect on what you’ve accomplished and the strategies we’ve discussed. What do you feel are your main takeaways from today?

User: I think being proactive about facing my fears and understanding my support network are my two biggest takeaways.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those will serve you well. Remember, you’re making progress, and this is a journey. If you ever feel like you need additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more confident about trying the fair now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lanlan! I’m proud of you for the strides you’ve taken. I look forward to hearing about your experience at the fair next time. Take care of yourself! 

User: Bye! I will. See you next time!
