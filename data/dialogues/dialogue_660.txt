Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I’m glad you’re here today. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really angry and frustrated. Ever since my surgery, it feels like the hospital has just pushed me aside. I can’t shake off this resentment, and it makes my life so difficult.

Consultant: It sounds really tough for you, feeling marginalized and dealing with these emotions. Can you tell me more about what specifically has triggered this anger towards the hospital?

User: Well, being moved to the logistics department feels like a punishment. I was a part of the hospital community, and now I feel like an outsider. It’s as if my contributions don’t matter anymore.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, feeling like you’re no longer valued. When you think about this change, what thoughts cross your mind that contribute to your feelings of resentment?

User: I constantly think that the hospital is ignoring my abilities and just sees me as someone who's broken. It feels humiliating.

Consultant: I can understand how that would be incredibly frustrating and hurtful to feel like you're being overlooked. Do you find that these thoughts impact your day-to-day life in other ways?

User: Absolutely. I feel anxious about going to work and dread facing my colleagues. It puts me in a bad mood constantly.

Consultant: It seems like your negative feelings towards the hospital are affecting your workplace interactions as well. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think about your colleagues, what do you tell yourself?

User: I feel like they must think I’m useless now and that they don't respect me anymore. I feel like I can’t do anything right.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable to worry about others’ perceptions, but let’s take a moment to question those thoughts. What evidence do you have to support the idea that they see you as useless?

User: I mean, I don’t have any direct evidence. It’s just how I feel. They haven’t said anything, but I feel that way since I’m not in my previous position.

Consultant: It’s good that you recognize there isn’t concrete evidence. Sometimes our feelings can trick us into believing things that aren't true. How would you encourage a friend who felt the same way as you do now?

User: I would tell them that their worth isn’t defined by their job title. But it's hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s such a kind perspective to have for a friend. It can be challenging to extend the same kindness to ourselves. What if we tried to reframe how you view your current role? What positives might you find in your new position?

User: I guess it gives me a chance to learn new skills and still contribute in some way. But it feels like consolation.

Consultant: Recognizing that there are still opportunities for growth is a positive step. Let’s think of it this way—could this new role serve as an avenue to show your resilience and adaptability instead of a consolation?

User: That makes sense. I can see it that way. It’s hard, though, because I still feel this anger towards the hospital.

Consultant: Anger is a valid emotion, especially in your situation. How would it feel to acknowledge that anger, but also allow space for other feelings like hope or possibility?

User: It feels a bit freeing to think that I can hold both. But it’s still frustrating to deal with the hospital’s lack of support.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s important to hold both feelings. You could validate your frustration while also recognizing the support from your family and friends. Speaking of which, how do your loved ones feel about what you've been through?

User: They are supportive, but they don’t fully understand my experience. Sometimes I feel like they just want me to move on.

Consultant: It’s challenging when loved ones want to help but may not grasp the depth of your situation. Have you thought about sharing your feelings with them more openly?

User: No, not really. I’m worried they won’t get it or that I’ll be a burden.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to be hesitant, but expressing your feelings can help them understand your struggles better. It might also strengthen your support system. Would you be open to trying this?

User: I might be. I just worry about adding to their stress, especially with my son's studies.

Consultant: That’s understandable, wanting to protect your family. However, keeping everything bottled up could lead to more stress over time. Perhaps you could choose a moment to share what you feel comfortable with, starting small?

User: That sounds reasonable. I can try that. 

Consultant: That’s a great approach, Ms. Li! Allowing yourself to express some feelings can ease the burden. Returning to your experience in the hospital, if you had to express what you want from them, what would that be?

User: I want them to acknowledge the impact their decisions have on people like me. A little empathy would go a long way.

Consultant: Acknowledgment and empathy are so important! Considering how you’ve expressed your feelings, if you did receive that empathy, how would it change your current outlook on your situations?

User: I think it would help me feel less alone and more worthy of support. It would make my anger a bit lighter.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. Focusing on your need for acknowledgment can help shift your perspective from anger towards seeking better support for yourself. Perhaps we can brainstorm ways for you to seek that acknowledgment in healthy ways? 

User: That could help. I guess I need to figure out how to channel this anger constructively.

Consultant: Exactly! This can be an opportunity for empowerment. What activities or outlets can you think of that might help you process or express your anger?

User: Maybe I could write about my experiences or talk to others in similar situations.

Consultant: Those are both excellent ideas! Writing can clarify your feelings, and connecting with others who understand can provide that sense of community and validation you’re seeking. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think recognizing that it’s okay to feel angry, but I can also seek positive outlets for those feelings, is really helpful.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Ms. Li. Remember, it's healthy to validate your emotions while also looking for constructive ways to address them. I’m here to support you on this journey, so please feel free to reach out anytime you need guidance. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I’m glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I'd like to understand how you’ve been feeling since our last discussion. Can you share what’s on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m still feeling really angry and disappointed about the hospital's response to my compensation request. I thought that after all I’ve been through, they would show some understanding, but it feels like they don’t care at all.

Consultant: I can hear how frustrating that must be for you. It's understandable to feel this way, especially given your experiences. What specifically about the hospital's response has been the most difficult for you to accept?

User: They just brushed me off, like my problems don’t matter. I feel helpless because I don’t know how to make them listen or take me seriously. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling unheard, which is very painful. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. When you think about how they treated your concerns, what thoughts are coming up for you?

User: I keep thinking that they should have been more compassionate. I also feel like I’m not fighting hard enough for what I deserve. I just get so emotional about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel emotional when facing unfair treatment. You mentioned feeling like you’re not fighting hard enough. Do you think there are specific moments that trigger these intense feelings of anger or frustration for you?

User: Yes, definitely. When I remember the surgery and the risks I took, I feel my anger flare up. It feels unfair that I went through all that and still have to struggle for recognition.

Consultant: That’s a very valid feeling, Ms. Li. It appears that reflecting on your experience with the surgery brings forth a lot of emotion. Let’s try to recognize and capture those thoughts when they arise. What do you think you can do in those moments to manage the anger more constructively?

User: I guess I could try to step back and breathe, but honestly, it’s hard to think about anything else when I’m angry.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging to think clearly when emotions are running high. Would you be open to practicing some techniques during our sessions that can help you recognize those moments and respond differently, perhaps even before the anger escalates?

User: That sounds good. I’m willing to try. I need some strategies to deal with my feelings.

Consultant: Great! Recognizing when anger surfaces is the first step. Let's work on identifying specific triggers in your day-to-day life that lead to those feelings and how we might address them. What other situations, aside from your interactions with the hospital, tend to make you feel similar anger?

User: Sometimes it happens at home, especially when there’s stress about money. My husband and I have been arguing about finances lately. 

Consultant: It seems like financial stress is adding another layer to your emotions. Managing finances can be stressful, especially when coupled with the feelings you're experiencing from the hospital situation. How do you and your husband usually discuss these financial matters?

User: We often end up arguing instead of talking. It feels like we’re both just frustrated and don’t know how to approach the topic without getting angry.

Consultant: I totally understand. Conversations around money can easily lead to misunderstandings. Would it help if we brainstormed ways to communicate about finances in a calmer fashion, even incorporating some of the anger management strategies we talked about?

User: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. We need to find a better way to talk about it without just snapping at each other.

Consultant: Absolutely. One technique is to set a specific time to discuss finances when both of you are calm. You could use "I" statements to express how you feel without blaming each other. For example, saying, "I feel worried about our finances" rather than "You never help with the budget." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds like a good approach. I want to make sure he knows I’m worried, not just angry.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective. Being open about your feelings can foster understanding. Working together on managing finances could also relieve some of that emotional burden. Would you like to explore some ways to prepare for that discussion with your husband?

User: Yes, that would be great. I really want to find a way to make it less confrontational.

Consultant: Perfect! We can start by writing down your concerns and any goals you might have regarding your finances together. This way, you both can refer to the same points during your conversation. What do you think your primary goals might be?

User: I guess I want us to agree on a budget and make sure we’re both on the same page about spending. 

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable. Making sure to involve your husband in that process can help him feel part of the solution. If you both agree on a budget, it could reduce stress and arguments in the future. How do you feel about the idea of creating a joint budget together?

User: I think that’s important. I like the idea of working as a team rather than opponents in this.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Teamwork can definitely ease tensions. Remember, it’s also okay to acknowledge feelings of frustration that may arise during the discussion. The awareness of these emotions can help you respond more compassionately to each other. 

User: Right. If we can both be open about our frustrations, that would make things feel safer, I think.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a safe space for this discussion is key. As we continue, I want you to remember that expressing feelings is part of healthy communication. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed today, both regarding the hospital situation and your conversations about finances?

User: I feel hopeful. I think these strategies could really help me manage my feelings and lead to better conversations with my husband. 

Consultant: That's encouraging to hear, Ms. Li! I'm glad you feel hopeful. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize what you can take away: recognizing triggers, using calm communication strategies, and thinking of your husband as your partner in this journey. 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely focus on those points.

Consultant: Wonderful! I believe these steps will help you manage your emotions more effectively. Continue practicing, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. If any challenges arise, remember that it's perfectly okay to seek help. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ms. Li! Take care and talk soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! It's great to see you again. I remember from our last session that you were feeling anxious about your family's financial future. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about our financial situation. It's been really stressful, especially after that discussion with my husband. I worry about how we will manage everything moving forward.

Consultant: I hear you; it sounds like these worries are weighing heavily on your mind. Can you share more about what specific thoughts or concerns you have regarding your finances?

User: Well, I’m concerned about whether we’re saving enough for emergencies and how we will pay for my son’s education in the future. It feels overwhelming to think about all of this.

Consultant: That does sound overwhelming. It's understandable to feel that way when thinking about future responsibilities. What strategies or plans have you considered to help manage these financial concerns?

User: Honestly, I haven't really made any specific plans yet. I just keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong and how unprepared we might be.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are causing you quite a bit of anxiety. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What emotions do you experience when you think about being unprepared for potential financial issues?

User: I feel anxious and a bit hopeless. It's like there's this constant worry in my mind, and I can't seem to silence it.

Consultant: That constant worry can be really challenging to cope with. You mentioned feeling hopeless—when was the last time you felt more optimistic about your family's financial situation?

User: I guess I felt a little hopeful when I thought about budgeting and maybe finding ways to cut expenses. But those feelings fade quickly when I think about all the unknowns.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that there have been moments of hope. Let’s focus on those budgeting ideas. Have you had the chance to discuss these budgeting strategies with your husband?

User: Not really. I felt too overwhelmed to bring it up, plus I didn’t want to add to his stress.

Consultant: That makes sense. Sometimes taking that first step to talk about our concerns can feel daunting. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable starting that conversation with him?

User: Maybe if I prepare some points beforehand on how we could prioritize and manage our expenses, it would help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Preparing some points sounds like a great approach! It can also ease the tension of the conversation. What kinds of things would you consider prioritizing in your budget?

User: I think we should definitely prioritize savings for emergencies, and then perhaps focus on necessary expenses first. I just don’t know how to present it clearly.

Consultant: Those sound like solid priorities. Would it help if we created a simple outline together to clarify how you could present these ideas to him?

User: Yes, I think that would help me a lot. I need to organize my thoughts better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s start outlining your ideas. You could begin with your concerns, then discuss the importance of an emergency fund, followed by necessary expenses. Does that structure sound good to you?

User: Yes, that makes sense. I like how that flows.

Consultant: Great! Once you share these ideas, how do you think your husband might respond to your suggestions?

User: He might appreciate that I’m taking the initiative to prepare and want to work together on this. He is usually open to discussing these things.

Consultant: That sounds promising! It’s wonderful that you have a supportive partner. How do you feel about taking this step towards improving your financial discussions at home?

User: I feel a bit more at ease just talking about it. I think having a plan will make it easier.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift. Let's also think about how you might feel supported if things start to feel overwhelming again after your conversation.

User: Perhaps having a backup plan or even setting aside a little time to check in with myself could help.

Consultant: That sounds very proactive! Self-check-ins can be a great way to manage your feelings. What kind of self-care practices do you enjoy that you could incorporate during these times?

User: I like to take walks or maybe write in my journal. Those help me clear my mind.

Consultant: Those are excellent ways to recharge. Would you like to set a goal to incorporate those self-care practices more regularly during this budgeting process?

User: Yes, I think doing those things could really help me stay balanced.

Consultant: Wonderful! It seems like you have some effective strategies in place. Before we end today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our discussion about financial management?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is the importance of communication with my husband and having a solid plan in place. It feels manageable now.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Remember, taking it step by step can alleviate some of that overwhelming feeling. As we wrap up, what do you feel you need to continue moving toward improved financial discussions and feelings of security?

User: I need to prepare my talking points, practice self-care, and stay proactive about checking in with myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach. I'm glad to hear you're feeling more equipped to handle this. We'll continue to build on these skills in our future sessions. You're doing great, and I'm proud of your progress.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Li! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Until next time, take care and I look forward to hearing about your next steps!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling after our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling somewhat better, actually. I've been reflecting on the things we discussed, especially about exploring new ways to improve my life quality. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're open to trying new approaches. Can you share any specific thoughts or experiences that stood out to you since we last spoke?

User: I attended the patient support group, and it really helped me see my situation in a different light. It made me feel less alone, and I’m curious about trying some of the techniques we discussed.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you found the support group helpful! Connection with others can be very empowering. Which techniques do you feel drawn to trying first?

User: I think I want to learn more about relaxation techniques. I believe it could help me manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: Relaxation techniques can indeed be very beneficial. Let’s explore what you know about them and how we can integrate some of those techniques into your daily routine. What do you envision relaxation looking like for you?

User: I would love to feel more at ease and less tense, especially after a long day at work. Maybe just some mental calm would be great.

Consultant: That’s a helpful goal, Ms. Li. Finding mental calm is important. Have you tried any relaxation exercises before, or is this all new to you?

User: I've never really tried any, but I’ve heard about deep breathing and guided visualization. 

Consultant: Both are excellent options! Deep breathing can help reduce immediate stress, while guided visualization allows you to mentally escape to a peaceful place. Would you like to try practicing deep breathing together now?

User: Sure! I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. I want you to breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Alright, I’m ready. 

Consultant: Let’s start now. Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… and exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice! I felt a little bit lighter.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating just a few minutes of deep breathing can really help your body's stress response. How do you think you could fit this practice into your daily life?

User: Maybe I can do it in the mornings before work and try to remember to do it at my desk during breaks.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Consistency is key. Besides deep breathing, are there other activities you enjoy that might help you relax?

User: I used to love reading, but I haven’t had much time for it lately. 

Consultant: Reading can be a great escape and a way to unwind. What kind of books do you enjoy?

User: I enjoy fiction, especially stories that transport me to different places.

Consultant: That sounds delightful! How about setting aside even just a short time for reading each week to help you relax? 

User: Yes, I think that could really help. I’d like to give myself permission to enjoy my hobbies more.

Consultant: Giving yourself that permission is very important. It’s about taking care of yourself. As you explore these relaxation techniques, how do you think they might affect your overall mood?

User: I hope it makes me feel more balanced and helps with the anxiety. 

Consultant: Absolutely. It's amazing how small practices can lead to significant improvements in mood and anxiety. Remember, you’re in control of these changes. 

User: I feel encouraged, and I’m looking forward to trying these techniques. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Ms. Li! As you practice relaxation, we can also explore how to maintain a positive mindset around challenges. Would you be open to that in future sessions?

User: Yes, definitely! I’d like to learn more about staying positive.

Consultant: We’ll work on that together. To wrap up today, would you like to summarize what we've discussed, or anything you’re particularly excited about trying?

User: I’m excited about deep breathing and reading more. I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you’re feeling more equipped! You’re making great progress. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m looking forward to our next conversation and hearing how your practice goes. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the meantime. 

User: Will do! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better. I've been trying to use the relaxation techniques we discussed. They seem to help, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed at work or at home.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're starting to integrate those techniques into your daily life. Can you share a moment where you used them recently?

User: Sure! Just last week, I had a stressful day at work. I took a few minutes to breathe deeply and focus on my surroundings. It actually calmed me down quite a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing can be very effective. How did you feel afterward? Did it change your outlook on the rest of your day?

User: Yes, it definitely did. I felt more centered and I was able to approach my tasks with a clearer mind. I even managed to finish everything on my list that day.

Consultant: Excellent progress! It seems that you are really embracing these techniques. How about your feelings related to your voice issues? Have the relaxation methods had any impact there?

User: I think so. When I’m calmer, my voice seems to hold up better. I don't feel as strained when I speak, but it’s still a challenge sometimes.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s encouraging that you notice a connection between your emotional state and your voice quality. What might help you maintain that calmness through voice challenges?

User: I guess I need to remind myself to use those techniques more consistently, maybe even before I need to speak in a meeting or to my family.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Establishing a routine can help reinforce the benefits. Is there a specific situation you anticipate where you might try this out?

User: Yes, I have a family gathering coming up. I feel anxious about how my voice will hold up there.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel anxious. How might you use your relaxation techniques before and during the gathering to help support yourself?

User: I could take some time beforehand to practice deep breathing. And maybe even remind myself that it’s okay if my voice isn’t perfect.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset. Focusing on the effort rather than perfection can really help. How does that make you feel about the upcoming gathering?

User: I feel a bit more empowered knowing I have some tools to use. I think I can handle it better now.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective! You're developing confidence in your abilities. As we prepare to wrap up our session today, what do you feel has been your biggest insight or achievement so far?

User: I feel like I’ve learned to take control of my anxiety rather than let it control me, especially with my voice challenges.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Li! Let’s take a moment to reflect on ways to sustain this progress. What strategies do you think might help you continue to strengthen your emotional stability moving forward?

User: I think I need to keep up with my relaxation practice regularly and maybe even explore more mindfulness exercises. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Consistency will be key. As we finish our session today, remember the progress you've made and the tools you've acquired. You can always revisit these techniques when you need to.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support. I feel more hopeful about my situation now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! It's been wonderful to see your growth. If challenges arise, remember that you are capable. You can always reach out whenever you need more help.

User: Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Until next time, take care of yourself, Li. It was a pleasure working with you today!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! It's wonderful to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling better recently. Today, I’d like to reflect on your progress and discuss ways to maintain these improvements. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a lot better. My emotional state has improved significantly, and I can talk more openly with my family now. It’s a relief to feel lighter.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Being able to communicate openly with your family is such an important step. Can you share more about how this change has affected your daily life?

User: Well, I used to avoid conversations because I was self-conscious about my voice. Now, I find myself engaging more during family meals, and it feels nice to connect with them.

Consultant: That sounds very uplifting! Sharing meals and connecting with your loved ones can really enhance relationships. What strategies or activities do you think contributed to this change?

User: I participated in some group activities and focused on various coping strategies. It helped me to express myself and not be afraid of my voice issue anymore.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you found those group activities helpful. Engaging with others can often provide support and encouragement. What specific strategies did you find useful in those activities?

User: Practicing speaking exercises and mindfulness techniques made a difference. I started to feel that my voice didn’t define who I am.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Ms. Li. It's important to separate our identity from our challenges. Moving forward, how do you envision maintaining this positive mindset and the progress you’ve made?

User: I think I could continue practicing those techniques regularly. I also want to keep that openness in my communication with my family.

Consultant: Those are excellent plans! Regular practice can reinforce the skills you’ve developed. As for communication with your family, how can you ensure that this open dialogue continues?

User: Maybe setting aside time for family talks or sharing activities together could help. We can establish a supportive environment every week.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Regular family meetings or shared activities can strengthen your relationships. Are there any concerns or obstacles you think might come up as you try to maintain these improvements?

User: I'm a bit worried about reverting to my old habits if I face stress again. Sometimes life can get overwhelming, and I don’t want to lose this progress.

Consultant: It's completely normal to worry about setbacks. What strategies do you think could help you navigate stress if it arises and maintain your progress?

User: I guess having quick mindfulness exercises or reaching out to a friend could help me stay grounded during tough times.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Mindfulness can really help when stress levels increase. How do you feel about incorporating these strategies into your daily routine?

User: I feel optimistic! I can set reminders on my phone to practice mindfulness and maybe schedule regular catch-ups with a friend.

Consultant: Great! Setting reminders is a practical approach. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you believe has been your biggest achievement during our sessions?

User: I think my biggest achievement is recognizing my self-worth beyond my voice issues and improving my ability to communicate within my family.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a profound achievement, and you should be proud of it. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself of your progress when you face challenges in the future?

User: I could keep a journal to document my feelings and successes. Reading it can remind me of how far I've come.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea, Ms. Li. Reflecting on your journey through journaling can reinforce your progress and serve as a source of motivation. As today’s session comes to a close, do you feel prepared to apply these strategies and maintain your growth?

User: Yes, I definitely do! I appreciate all the support and guidance I’ve received during our sessions.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you have the tools and strategies to handle challenges ahead. If you ever need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I’ll take that to heart and look forward to continuing this journey.

Consultant: I wish you the best, Ms. Li. It’s been rewarding to see your progress. Take care, and I believe you will continue to thrive!
