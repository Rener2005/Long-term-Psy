Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been really stressed. The pressure of graduating is weighing on me, especially with all the decisions about whether to pursue a master's or find a job. I feel so lost.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, Liu. It's understandable to feel that way when facing such significant decisions. Can you tell me more about what aspects of these choices are making you feel the most anxious?

User: I think it’s the fear of making the wrong decision again. I remember messing up my college choices, and it still haunts me. It’s like I don’t trust myself to make the right choice this time.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel hesitant, especially when past experiences affect your confidence. You mentioned feeling haunted by your past decision. Can you explore what feelings come up when you think about that experience?

User: I feel embarrassed and frustrated with myself. Sometimes, I think, what if I end up regretting whatever choice I make now?

Consultant: Those feelings of embarrassment and frustration are valid. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of worry about regrets. Can you identify how that worry impacts your daily life and ability to make choices?

User: It makes me feel paralyzed. I can’t concentrate on anything else, and I often procrastinate because I’m scared to commit to a decision.

Consultant: Procrastination can be a way to cope with that fear, but it also keeps you stuck. What would happen if you gave yourself some space to explore both options without the pressure of making an immediate decision?

User: I guess that could help. But I still wonder if I’m wasting time by not deciding right away.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but exploring options can actually be constructive. Let’s try to break it down. What information do you need to feel more confident about making a choice?

User: I need to understand the pros and cons of both paths better, but it feels so daunting to gather all that information.

Consultant: It can definitely feel overwhelming. How about we take it one step at a time? What’s the first piece of information you could gather to start that process?

User: Maybe I could look into potential job opportunities first, just to see what’s out there?

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Focusing on tangible information can help reduce anxiety. Once you gather some insights, how might that change your perspective?

User: I think it might make me feel less fearful about job prospects. I just wish I could shake off this anxiety.

Consultant: It’s a tough feeling to shake, but acknowledging it is a good step. Let's explore how you feel when you experience that anxiety. What thoughts are racing through your mind at those moments?

User: I often think, “What if I fail again?” and “I’m not capable enough.”

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let’s challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those beliefs about yourself?

User: Well, I did manage to pass all my courses despite the pressure, but I still doubt my abilities.

Consultant: It seems you’ve had successes that counter those negative beliefs. What would you tell a friend in your position who was doubting themselves?

User: I’d probably tell them to acknowledge their accomplishments and remind them that one mistake doesn’t define their entire path.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. How can you apply that same kindness to yourself in this situation?

User: I guess I could start by reminding myself of my past achievements instead of focusing solely on mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s think of some specific achievements you can write down as a reminder. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds helpful. I could list my grades and any contributions I made during projects.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting on those positive experiences can boost your confidence. As we talk about your decision-making, what steps can you take this week to ease your anxiety about these choices?

User: I’ll start my list of achievements and look up job openings. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Liu. Taking manageable steps is key. How do you feel about these tasks now?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It seems less overwhelming when I break it down.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember that it’s okay to take your time with this process. As we continue our sessions, we can explore more ways to manage this anxiety. Do you have any concerns about what we’ve discussed today?

User: No, I think this is all really helpful. I just hope I can stick to the plan.

Consultant: It’s totally understandable to have that concern. Setting small, achievable goals will help you build up your confidence. As we wrap up, is there a particular strategy you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I’d like to focus on challenging my negative thoughts and remembering my successes.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent focus. Revisiting your achievements and challenging negative thoughts will be powerful tools. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain; the important part is taking the steps to understand your feelings better.

User: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session too! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're back for our session today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your anxiety and future choices?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I keep thinking about applying for graduate school and the pressure of finding a job after graduation. It just makes me so anxious, and I don’t really know how to manage it.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Liu. It’s understandable to feel that pressure, especially with so many uncertainties ahead. Let's explore more about what aspects of this situation make you feel the most anxious. Can you tell me what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about these future choices?

User: When I think about graduate school, I worry that I won't be good enough or that I won't even get accepted. With jobs, I fear that I won't find something suitable and that I'll disappoint my family.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound challenging to deal with. It seems like there’s a lot of pressure tied to expectations of yourself and your family's hopes. How do these thoughts affect your emotions when you sit down to study or plan for the future?

User: I feel paralyzed sometimes, like I can't focus on anything because I'm too busy worrying about failing. I just keep procrastinating, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stuck in a cycle of worry and procrastination. It’s like the weight of those thoughts stops you from moving forward. Can we take a moment to identify where you might be experiencing these automatic thoughts? What specific thoughts do you have when you find yourself procrastinating?

User: I often think, "What if I apply and get rejected?" or "What if I take the wrong path?" Those thoughts make it hard to take any action.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing those thoughts, Liu. Those are indeed very powerful and negative beliefs. Let’s take a closer look—what evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? And are there any times when your fears didn't come true?

User: Well, there were times in the past when I thought I would fail but ended up doing well. It's just hard to remember those moments when I'm so focused on the risks.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It sounds like you have experienced successes that contradict your fears. How might you reframe these anxious thoughts to reflect that you can also succeed? For example, instead of thinking, "What if I get rejected?" you could say, "I have strengths that will make me a worthy candidate."

User: That makes sense. I suppose I could focus on what I can offer rather than just the fear of rejection. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to your strengths can help build your confidence. Now, let’s consider some practical steps. What small actions could you take to gradually prepare for applications and reduce your anxiety?

User: Maybe I could start by creating a timeline for the applications and doing some research on programs that interest me. That seems less overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful first step, Liu! A timeline can provide structure and help you feel more in control. Is there a specific action you could commit to this week regarding your timeline or research?

User: I could spend an hour this week looking at programs and writing down what I find. 

Consultant: Great commitment! Taking that hour can help break down the larger task into something manageable. As you do this, how do you think you’ll feel after completing that task?

User: I think I’ll feel a bit more accomplished and maybe a little less anxious about the whole process.

Consultant: Exactly! Accomplishing even small tasks can gradually ease your anxiety. Before we wrap up, let’s talk about how you can remind yourself of the successes you've had in the past when doubts arise. How can you incorporate those reminders into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could write a list of my past successes and keep it somewhere I can see it often, like on my desk.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful strategy! Keeping a visible reminder of your strengths can support you during moments of self-doubt. As we conclude today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I feel like I've realized that my fears aren't always based on evidence, and I actually have achievements I can focus on. It's comforting to think that I can take small steps forward.

Consultant: That’s a huge insight, Liu! Recognizing that your fears can be challenged and that you have the ability to take small steps is invaluable. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. If you feel overwhelmed again, just revisit those strategies or come back here for support. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and feel a bit lighter after talking today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of what you’re working on and how you’re approaching your anxiety. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been a bit better in some ways, but I still feel really pressured when it comes to making decisions about my future career. I thought attending those job lectures would help, but I'm still stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of clarity and pressure. You mentioned the job lectures gave you some insights. Can you tell me a bit more about what you learned that was helpful?

User: They explained the different roles and what skills are needed, which was useful. But now I feel overwhelmed because I don't know which direction to take, and I'm scared of making the wrong choice.

Consultant: I can see how getting more information could be both enlightening and overwhelming at the same time. Let’s dive deeper into this fear of making the wrong choice. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about making a decision?

User: I keep thinking that if I choose the wrong job, I will regret it forever. It feels like I have to make the perfect choice right now.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy—a lot of pressure to find the 'perfect' choice immediately. Can we explore that thought together? What supports that belief that there is only one perfect option?

User: I guess I’ve always heard that making a career choice is really important, and I don’t want to let my family down or waste my education.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when your family's expectations are involved. However, have you considered that many people change careers multiple times throughout their lives? One decision doesn’t have to define your entire future.

User: I haven’t really thought about it that way. It feels like a big deal to me now, but maybe I could adapt later.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing it as a step rather than an endpoint can be freeing. Would you say that this change in perspective lessens some of your pressure?

User: A bit, yes. But I still feel anxious about making any decision at all.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal! Anxiety can often accompany decision-making. Let’s try to address that together. When you begin to feel anxious about making a choice, what are some coping strategies you've tried?

User: I usually just avoid thinking about it or try to distract myself with other things.

Consultant: Avoidance can seem like a relief in the short term, but it often prolongs the anxiety. How about we brainstorm some healthier coping strategies that could help reduce your anxiety while enabling you to face decisions?

User: That sounds like a good idea. What do you suggest?

Consultant: One approach is to break down your decision-making process into smaller steps. For instance, you could list out your options and the pros and cons of each. How does that sound to you?

User: That could work. I like lists, so maybe that would help organize my thoughts.

Consultant: Great! Organizing your thoughts can often clarify your feelings. Would you be willing to try this method for your career choices before our next session?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ll try to list out some career options and their pros and cons.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to focus on what excites you about each option, not just the negative aspects. Can I ask how you feel about taking this approach?

User: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, but I still worry I won't figure it out.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel a bit anxious—that’s part of the process. Just remember, the goal is to gather information and not make the decision alone in one go. You’re building your decision-making skills.

User: That makes sense. I hope I can handle this pressure.

Consultant: You’ve already shown resilience by seeking help and being open to exploring your thoughts. How can you remind yourself of your capabilities when feeling the pressure?

User: Maybe I could write it down somewhere. Remind myself I've handled challenges in the past.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Reflecting on past successes can reinforce your confidence. What are some accomplishments you’re proud of that you could note?

User: I did well in my coursework last semester and supported my brother with his studies. 

Consultant: Those are significant achievements! It's important to acknowledge your strengths as you navigate these career decisions. Would you be open to sharing that list with me in our next session?

User: Yes, I can do that.

Consultant: Perfect! As we wrap up today, remember that it's about progress, not perfection. Allow yourself to explore without harsh judgments. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel relieved that I have steps to take. It's nice to see this pressure as something I can manage rather than something I have to face alone.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You have the resources within yourself to handle this. Please take care of yourself until we meet again, and remember, you're not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you, I appreciate your help. Looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Likewise! See you next time, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about your career choices?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more relaxed, especially after participating in the growth workshops. However, I still feel a lot of pressure concerning my career decisions.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve gained some valuable insights from the workshops, which is wonderful. Can you share what new perspectives you have about your career choices?

User: Yes, I realized that there are more options available to me than I initially thought. I used to feel stuck, but now I see potential paths I hadn’t considered before.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your thinking! It’s natural to feel pressure when making choices, especially with new options to consider. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel pressured?

User: I think it’s the fear of making the wrong choice. With my family’s financial situation, I don’t want to waste resources on something that might not work out.

Consultant: I can understand that concern. Wanting to make the right decision for both yourself and your family is completely valid. Have you had the chance to discuss these feelings with anyone, perhaps friends or peers?

User: Not really. I feel like they might not understand the pressure I’m under since they seem confident about their choices.

Consultant: It can be tough when we feel isolated in our experiences. Remember, it’s okay to seek support. Would you be open to discussing ways to connect with others who might share similar feelings or experiences?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. I just worry they might not have any solutions.

Consultant: It’s about sharing experiences, not just finding solutions. Talking about feelings can often alleviate some of the pressure. What do you think about trying to open up to a supportive friend or classmate?

User: I guess I could try that. I just never know how to start such conversations.

Consultant: Starting a conversation can feel daunting. How about reaching out with something simple, like sharing your recent feelings about career choices? You could say something like, “I’ve been thinking a lot about my future career, and it’s making me a bit anxious.” 

User: That sounds doable. I could just share my feelings without expecting a specific solution from them.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating a safe space for yourself. How are you feeling about reaching out after hearing that suggestion?

User: A bit more hopeful, I think. It feels good to think about talking to someone.

Consultant: That’s great progress! Now that you're feeling more hopeful, let’s spend some time discussing how to apply the insights you gained in the workshops to your career choices. What are some of those new perspectives that you find most helpful?

User: One important insight was that it’s okay to take time to explore my options rather than rushing into a decision.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization. Taking the time to explore can really help reduce pressure. What steps could you take to allow yourself that exploration time?

User: Maybe I could set aside specific days to research different career paths or talk to professionals in those fields.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Researching and connecting with professionals can provide you with more clarity and confidence in your choices. What careers interest you the most at this moment?

User: I’m really interested in teaching, but I’m also considering roles in language translation and editing.

Consultant: Those are both excellent paths! Have you had a chance to look into what those roles entail or speak to anyone currently working in those areas?

User: I haven't yet, but I would like to ask my professors and see if they can connect me with professionals.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Professors can often provide valuable insights and connections. How do you feel about taking that step to reach out to them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It’s a step towards pursuing what I might want to do.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it's an exploration, not a commitment. How can I support you in this next step?

User: Maybe we could come up with some questions I could ask them during the conversation. That might make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Here are a few questions you could ask: “What do you enjoy most about your work?” “What challenges do you face?” and “What advice would you give someone considering this career?” How do those questions feel to you?

User: They seem good! They’ll help me get a better understanding of what to expect.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Preparing those questions can boost your confidence as well. Reflecting on our session today, how has your viewpoint on your career decisions shifted?

User: I feel lighter. Talking about my feelings and making a plan to reach out makes me feel less anxious. 

Consultant: That’s an encouraging shift! Feeling lighter is a beautiful sign of progress. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one takeaway you’ll carry forward with you?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to take my time and that I have support available. 

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone in it. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, just revisit the strategies we discussed. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, Liu! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and support. I'm looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling after our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel a bit more optimistic. Sharing my decision-making difficulties during the group activity helped me realize I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you found some comfort and support from your peers. Can you share more about how that experience helped you?

User: Well, it felt good to express my challenges openly. Others shared their struggles too, which made me feel like we’re all in this together. I think it boosted my confidence a bit.

Consultant: It’s great that the group environment allowed you to cultivate confidence and connection. What specific thoughts or feelings did you have during that activity?

User: I was initially very nervous about sharing, but once I started, I felt lighter. Hearing others’ experiences made me think maybe my choices aren't as dire as I worried they were.

Consultant: It sounds like that group helped you put things in perspective. Can you identify any particular moment during the discussion that had a significant impact on you?

User: Yes! One person talked about their own indecision, and it made me realize that it’s completely normal. Hearing their insights gave me some new ideas about my situation.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization! It shows that sharing and hearing different perspectives can really help us navigate our own choices. Looking ahead, how do you feel about using that support network again?

User: I think I would definitely like to participate more in those discussions. It’s reassuring, and I feel more capable of tackling my decision-making issues.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Engaging with your support network can enhance your confidence not just in decision-making, but in other areas too. What decision do you feel you need support with right now?

User: Right now, I'm trying to decide what field I want to specialize in after graduation. It’s a bit overwhelming since there are so many options.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with such an important decision. Let's explore that together. What aspects of each option are you considering? 

User: I’m looking at what I enjoy doing and also how practical each field is for my future career. I’m worried about making the wrong choice.

Consultant: Those are crucial factors to consider. It might help to write down the pros and cons of each option. Have you had a chance to do something like that?

User: I haven’t yet. I think it might help clarify things for me, but I also worry I’ll just get stuck again.

Consultant: That's a common concern, but it's important to remember that any choice can lead to new experiences. Would you be willing to set aside some time this week to start that list?

User: I could try that. If I break it down into small steps, it might be less intimidating.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can make a big difference. After you create your list, we can review it together. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think having a plan will help me feel more in control.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about giving yourself permission to explore without the pressure of having to make a perfect choice right away. How do you feel about sharing your list with the group after you finish?

User: I’d actually like that! It might spark more ideas and discussions with them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Liu! Opening up about your process can foster even more support and insight from others. As you engage, how do you think this might change your view on your choices?

User: I think it will help me feel less isolated in my fears. Knowing others are going through similar things can really ease my mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely. Learning from one another can significantly lighten the emotional load we carry. What’s the biggest takeaway for you in this experience so far?

User: I’ve learned that I’m not alone and that sharing my thoughts can help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: That's a powerful lesson, Liu! Recognizing the value of support and open communication is crucial for your journey ahead. As we wrap up our session today, how are you feeling about your ability to tackle these decisions moving forward? 

User: Honestly, I feel much more confident! I’m looking forward to working on my list and sharing it with the group.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Would you like to schedule a follow-up session to discuss your progress and any further concerns?

User: Yes, please! I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Perfect! I will set that up for us. Thank you for being open today, Liu. I believe you are making solid progress towards feeling more confident about your future decisions. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here whenever you need support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. The uncertainty about my future choices has lessened a lot, and I feel more confident about my internship and job applications.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you tell me more about how this newfound confidence is helping you in your daily life and your internship preparations?

User: Well, I approached my internship with a much more positive attitude. I’m more willing to engage with my colleagues and take on new tasks, and I feel like I can handle whatever comes my way.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re embracing new challenges! What specific experiences during your internship have stood out for you as moments of growth or confidence?

User: I had to give a small presentation last week, and I was nervous at first. But I actually managed it fairly well and received positive feedback, which boosted my self-esteem even more.

Consultant: That’s an excellent achievement, Liu! Getting positive feedback can really reinforce your confidence. How did you feel right before and after the presentation?

User: Before, I was extremely anxious and questioning my abilities. But afterward, I felt proud and relieved, like I could take on anything!

Consultant: It’s amazing to see how overcoming those fears has impacted your confidence. Moving forward, how do you think you can continue to build on this positive momentum?

User: I think I’ll set small goals for myself during the internship, like speaking up in meetings or asking more questions. It seems like a good way to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: Setting smaller, achievable goals is a great strategy! It keeps you motivated without feeling overwhelmed. How do you plan to track your progress with these goals?

User: I might keep a journal to write down my experiences and reflections. This way, I can see how far I've come over time.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Writing can help solidify your thoughts and experiences. How do you feel about sharing your reflections with someone, perhaps a mentor or a friend, for additional support?

User: That sounds helpful. I think sharing my experiences with a trusted friend could provide me with more perspective and encouragement.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing can enrich your experience and offer new insights. Is there anything specific you would like to focus on today regarding your internship or future plans?

User: I guess I'm also a bit worried about balancing my studies with the internship. I want to do well in both, but it feels a bit overwhelming at times.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Balancing multiple responsibilities can be challenging. What strategies have you considered so far to manage your time effectively?

User: I’ve tried making schedules, but I often struggle to stick to them. Sometimes, I end up working late into the night, which isn’t ideal.

Consultant: It sounds like your current schedule might need some adjustment to make it more realistic for your lifestyle. What are some ways you could make your schedules more manageable or flexible?

User: Maybe I could block out specific times for studying and for the internship, and be more disciplined about sticking to those times. Also, scheduling in breaks could help balance my time better.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Implementing breaks can significantly enhance productivity and reduce burnout. Have you thought about what activities you might include during your breaks to reset?

User: I could go for short walks or do some light exercises. I think stepping away for a bit would help me recharge and shift my focus.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Engaging in physical activities can really clear your mind. How does it feel for you to consider these changes for balancing work and study?

User: It actually makes me feel more at ease thinking about it. I like having a plan and knowing I can take care of myself while pursuing my goals.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Creating a plan can definitely give you a sense of control and direction. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it’s about recognizing my achievements, setting practical goals, and balancing my responsibilities. I feel a lot more prepared for both my internship and my studies now.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Liu. You’ve shown incredible growth and foresight. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you envision maintaining this progress in the future?

User: I’ll keep journaling, sharing with friends, and staying open to feedback. I really want to keep moving forward.

Consultant: Those are great ways to maintain your growth! Just remember, it’s perfectly okay to ask for help when you need it. As we conclude our sessions, I'm confident in your ability to manage both your internship and studies successfully. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to seek support. 

User: Thank you so much for all your guidance! I truly appreciate it, and I feel ready to embrace my future.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember that you have the tools to continue on this path. Take care, and good luck with everything ahead!
