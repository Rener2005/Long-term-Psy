Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I noticed from our last session that you've been feeling quite anxious about social situations, especially in the classroom. Can you share more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, it's been really tough. After that time in class when I felt like everyone was laughing at me, I just can't stop thinking about it. Now I feel even more scared to speak up. It makes me feel really lonely, you know?

Consultant: I can see how that experience would leave you feeling anxious and isolated. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you to perform well in those social environments. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about speaking up in class?

User: I just keep thinking that I'll mess up again or that everyone will judge me. It's like a loop of negative thoughts that I can't escape from.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. These automatic thoughts can be so powerful. It's important to recognize how these thoughts affect your feelings and behaviors. When you think about messing up, how does that make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: I feel my heart racing, and I just freeze up. I get this tightness in my chest, and then I just want to disappear.

Consultant: That physical response makes sense, given your anxious thoughts. It sounds very uncomfortable. What do you usually do when you start feeling those physical symptoms in class? 

User: I usually just try to avoid participation as much as possible. I’ll just sit quietly and not draw attention to myself.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common response in these situations, but it tends to reinforce the fear over time. What if we explored some ways to gradually face these fears instead? 

User: I guess I’ve thought about it, but it seems really hard. What if I try and fail again?

Consultant: It's completely natural to be concerned about failing. But let's consider this: what evidence do you have that trying to participate again will lead to failure? Are there any positive experiences you could recall that might counter that fear?

User: I mean, there were times when I answered questions correctly before. But it feels like that was ages ago.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Those positive experiences are important, even if they feel distant. What if we focused on those moments and tried to build on them? We could think of small steps you could take to re-engage in those situations.

User: Small steps? Like what?

Consultant: We could start with something manageable, like practicing answering a question in class when it's a low-pressure situation. For example, maybe you could share your thoughts in a small group instead of the whole class first. How does that sound?

User: That sounds a bit less scary, I suppose. But I'm still worried about what others will think.

Consultant: It's absolutely understandable to worry about others' opinions. But remember, you can’t control how others react—only how you choose to respond. What if we work together to change the way you view those reactions?

User: I’d like to change my perspective. I don't want to be so afraid all the time.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Let’s practice some positive self-talk that you can use when you start feeling anxious again. How about saying something like, "I’m capable, and it's okay to make mistakes"?

User: I think I can try that. It might help to remind myself it’s okay to mess up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Mistakes are a part of learning. Each time you remind yourself of that, it can help shift your mindset. Would you like to create a plan for how you can gradually incorporate this positive self-talk in your daily routine?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I think having a plan might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline a few situations where you can practice this self-talk. For example, after each class, you can reflect on a point you contributed to and remind yourself of your strengths.

User: That sounds doable. I can definitely try to acknowledge one thing I did well each time.

Consultant: Excellent! It’s all about progress. As we move forward, let’s also think about how you can reinforce these moments. Perhaps setting a small reward for yourself?

User: I might treat myself to a nice snack or something after class.

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Positive reinforcement can be very encouraging. Let’s also discuss how you'll handle it if you experience that fear again. Having a backup plan can be helpful.

User: Maybe if I freeze up, I can remind myself to take a deep breath and recite my positive phrase.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy. Deep breathing can help calm your nervous system, and repeating that positive phrase can guide your thoughts back to a reassuring place. How confident do you feel about implementing this plan?

User: I feel a bit more confident now, actually. Writing it down feels like a step in the right direction.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things one step at a time. As we wrap up today, what would you say is the most valuable takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s the idea that it’s okay to mess up and to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. I feel hopeful about trying out my new plan.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Carry that hope with you as you implement these strategies. Remember, I’m here to support you through this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need help along the way.

User: Thank you so much. I feel a bit lighter after today’s session.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I'm proud of you for being so open and willing to work on this. Let’s continue to build on this progress next time we meet. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. Before we start, how have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and disappointed with myself lately. I tried to join a gathering in my dorm, but I couldn't talk to anyone. It just made me feel even worse.

Consultant: I can sense that this experience has been quite difficult for you. It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anxiety and disappointment. Can you tell me more about what you were hoping to achieve by attending the gathering?

User: I wanted to connect with my new classmates and maybe make some friends. But instead, I just ended up feeling more isolated and insecure.

Consultant: It sounds like making those social connections is very important to you. Let's explore this together. When you think about that gathering, what specific thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me for not being able to talk. I felt like I didn't belong there at all.

Consultant: Those thoughts are really impactful, and it’s understandable that they would make you feel anxious. Do you think there might be any evidence for those thoughts? For instance, did anyone actually say or do anything that suggested they were judging you?

User: No, nobody actually said anything. I think it was just in my head, but it felt so real at the time.

Consultant: That’s a really valuable observation. It's common for our minds to create intense feelings based on assumptions. How might you reframe those thoughts to be less negative? For example, could you consider that others might be feeling just as awkward?

User: I guess that could be true. Maybe they were as nervous as I was, but I just didn’t think of it that way.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a great start to shift that perspective. If you were to view yourself from a friend’s perspective in that gathering, what advice might you give them if they felt anxious like you did?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel nervous and that they could take their time to warm up to others.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach! Now, let’s think about some small, achievable steps you could take in future social situations to help build your confidence. Could you think of a small goal you might set for yourself next time?

User: Maybe I could practice starting a simple conversation with just one person instead of feeling overwhelmed by the whole group.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! A simpler, focused approach can really help. How do you think you would feel after setting that goal and accomplishing it?

User: I think I would feel a bit more confident and less scared about socializing. 

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small victories is so important. As you try out these steps, how can you remind yourself to be patient with your progress?

User: I guess I can try to keep in mind that everyone has their own pace in social situations and that it's okay to take one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s a helpful reminder! It sounds like you're starting to shift your mindset. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. What do you feel is the most valuable takeaway for you?

User: I think the idea of setting small, achievable goals and being kind to myself during this process really stands out to me.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, and it's an important step forward. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but with practice and patience, you can become more comfortable in those situations. How do you feel about coming back next week to share your experiences and progress?

User: I would like that. I want to keep working on this.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it! Remember, you're doing really well in recognizing these feelings and starting to change your approach. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Gao! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we get started, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I keep thinking about my recent exam failure, and it just makes me feel more anxious about showing up for group activities. 

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like those feelings of failure and anxiety are weighing heavily on you. Let’s explore that. How do you sense these feelings affecting your daily life and interactions with others?

User: I tend to avoid participating in group discussions. I feel so out of place compared to my peers. I get really nervous just thinking about speaking up.

Consultant: That makes sense, feeling out of place can be incredibly challenging. It's important to know that many students experience similar feelings. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you think about speaking in those situations?

User: I think I would embarrass myself or that everyone would judge me. Sometimes, I even convince myself that my opinions don’t matter.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt. Let’s take a moment to unpack those thoughts. How credible do you think those judgments about yourself really are? 

User: I suppose I don’t have any solid evidence that would prove I'm not capable. It’s just how I feel.

Consultant: That's a very important insight! Feelings can be powerful but they aren’t always aligned with reality. If a friend had similar fears, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to share opinions, even if they're not perfect.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate and supportive perspective. Now, let’s see if we can apply that same kindness to yourself. What might it look like to challenge those negative thoughts you have about sharing your opinions?

User: I could try to remind myself that it’s normal to be nervous but that I still have valuable things to say.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your value is key. What small steps could you take to begin practicing sharing your thoughts in a low-pressure setting?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my ideas with just one or two classmates that I feel comfortable with.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can help build your confidence. How do you feel about trying that in the coming week?

User: I think I could manage that. It feels less daunting to start with just a couple of people.

Consultant: Great! As we wrap up today, let’s include some relaxation techniques to help manage that anxiety when it arises. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises together?

User: Yes, I think that would really help. I often forget to breathe when I’m anxious.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's take a moment to practice deep breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth. Just focus on the rhythm of your breath. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels calming. I didn’t realize how much I needed that right now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear it. Breathing can be a powerful tool. Before our next session, I encourage you to incorporate that breathing exercise whenever you feel anxiety creeping in. 

User: I will definitely do that. Thank you for the suggestion!

Consultant: Remember to reflect on any small successes you experience, even just sharing with classmates. We’ll discuss how that goes when we meet next time. 

User: Sure, I’ll keep track of it. It encourages me to think about doing it.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! As you navigate those interactions, keep reminding yourself of your worth. You're making progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that, Gao! Your openness and willingness to tackle these challenges are commendable. Just remember, it's a process and every small step counts. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care and practice those techniques until we meet again.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling positive about your recent social experiences. Can we start by discussing how those interactions made you feel? 

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really happy after helping my classmates in the lab. They appreciated my input, and it made me realize I could contribute. But sometimes, I still feel anxious about joining in, especially when everyone seems more confident.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight, and it's great to hear that you received positive feedback. It's normal to feel a bit anxious in social situations, especially when comparing ourselves to others. What specific thoughts cross your mind when you feel that anxiety coming on?

User: I often think things like "What if I say something silly?" or "They won't want to hear what I have to say." It makes me hesitate to join conversations.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. They create a barrier to expressing yourself, even when you want to join in. Can you tell me how those thoughts make you feel emotionally when they come up?

User: When I think that way, I feel really nervous and a bit embarrassed. Sometimes I even feel like I want to just leave the room and avoid interactions altogether.

Consultant: I can understand how overwhelming that might feel. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts together. One question to consider is, how likely is it that people would actually think poorly of you for speaking up?  

User: I guess I can't know for sure. They might actually appreciate my input, like they did before. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s possible that they could value your contributions. Let's discuss how we can create some small, manageable social challenges for you to practice expressing yourself. What would you think about trying to share at least one comment or question in your next class?

User: That sounds a bit scary, but I think I could try it. Maybe I could prepare something to say beforehand to make it easier.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Preparing something in advance could help ease your nerves. What kind of topic or question might you want to share with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could ask about a project they mentioned in class. It’s something I wanted to know more about anyway.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opener! By showing interest in what they enjoy discussing, you can create a more comfortable space for interaction. After you try this, let’s reflect on how it felt for you. Are you comfortable with setting that goal for our next session?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’m feeling a little more confident just thinking about it!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Building that confidence is key. Let’s also keep track of the positive moments. When you have these experiences, perhaps you can jot them down. Does that sound feasible for you?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. I like the idea of documenting my progress.

Consultant: Great! Tracking those positive interactions and feelings can strengthen your confidence. It's like building a bank of good experiences to draw from. Remember, it’s a step-by-step process, and it’s okay to feel a bit anxious along the way.

User: Thanks! That makes it feel more manageable. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Just think of each interaction as a chance to grow. I'm really looking forward to hearing about your experience in our next session. Shall we set a time for that now?

User: Yes, let’s do that. I’m committed!

Consultant: Fantastic! I’ll see you then to talk about how things went. In the meantime, be kind to yourself and remember that it’s okay to take these steps at your own pace.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: Absolutely! I'm here for you. Take care, and I'll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! I'm really looking forward to hearing about your recent experiences. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. I've been participating more in club activities and it feels nice to connect with others while helping them.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're finding joy in helping others and building connections. Can you tell me more about how engaging in these activities has impacted your feelings about yourself?

User: It’s made me feel more confident, actually. I never thought I could contribute so much. Interacting with others in a group has been less intimidating than I expected.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! It sounds like you're starting to recognize the positive impact you can have in social settings, which is a significant step. What specific activities or interactions have stood out to you in the club?

User: We recently organized a small event where I helped plan everything. I felt really useful and people appreciated my input, which felt great!

Consultant: Wow, that’s impressive! Having your ideas acknowledged must have been really validating for you. How did it feel to take on that planning role?

User: It felt empowering. I realized that my suggestions can actually make a difference. I want to keep doing this!

Consultant: That's a brilliant realization! It’s clear that you have a lot to offer. How can we build on this positive experience to further enhance your social skills and confidence in these settings?

User: I think setting some specific social targets could help. Maybe like initiating conversations with new people at the next club meeting?

Consultant: Setting specific goals is an excellent strategy! Initiating conversations can be a bit daunting, but it’s a great way to expand your social circle. How do you envision approaching someone new at the meeting?

User: I might start by asking them about their role in the club or what they enjoyed most about our activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a friendly and open way to start a conversation! Asking about others’ experiences usually encourages them to open up. How do you feel about initiating that conversation?

User: I’m a bit anxious, but I think I can do it. If I prepare a little beforehand, I might feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Preparation is a great approach! Maybe we can brainstorm some key phrases or questions you can use. Would you like to practice one now?

User: Sure! I’d like to know how to ask someone what they like most about the club.

Consultant: A simple way can be, “Hey, I’m curious, what do you enjoy most about being in this club?” It’s open-ended and invites a detailed response. How does that sound to you?

User: That’s good! It doesn’t sound too intimidating when I say it like that.

Consultant: Exactly! The more you practice, the easier it will feel. How do you feel about setting a goal to speak to at least two new members during your next meeting?

User: I like that idea! It seems manageable, and it gives me a clear target.

Consultant: That’s a healthy goal! Focusing on connection rather than any pressure to impress can make it more enjoyable. How do you think achieving this goal will impact your confidence?

User: I believe it would boost my confidence even more. If I can successfully talk to new people, it will show me that I am capable of socializing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each successful interaction will reinforce that belief. After the meeting, we can review how it went, what worked well, and any areas for further growth. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, I’d love to reflect on it later. I’m excited to give it a try!

Consultant: I'm excited for you too! You're taking such proactive steps toward your personal growth. Remember, it’s about building connections and enjoying the experience, not just the outcome. How do you feel about that approach?

User: It feels better to think that way. I’ll focus more on the interaction than the results.

Consultant: That’s a perfect mindset! Embracing the experience will help you find joy in socializing. As we move forward, are there any other areas you'd like to explore or any challenges that come to mind?

User: I guess sometimes I worry about being judged, but I want to overcome that.

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries. However, focusing on your contributions and the enjoyment of connecting with others can help lessen those concerns. Would you like to develop strategies to cope with those feelings of being judged?

User: Yes, I'd like that! Maybe talking about it will help.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can work through those worries together. Remember, everyone has their insecurities, and understanding that can make social situations less daunting. 

User: That’s comforting to hear. I often feel like I’m the only one who struggles with these feelings.

Consultant: You're definitely not alone in feeling that way. Many people face similar challenges. As you continue to engage with others, remind yourself that vulnerability can lead to deeper connections. What are your thoughts on that?

User: I suppose if I’m more open, others might feel comfortable sharing too.

Consultant: Exactly! Authenticity often encourages openness in others. It’s a wonderful way to build trust and connection. Let's keep reinforcing these positive thoughts as you move forward.

User: I'm really looking forward to the next meeting now. I feel more empowered.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Just remember to be kind to yourself along the way. We can continue fostering your growth in our future sessions. Any final thoughts today?

User: Just that I'm excited to try out these strategies. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you, and I can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time. Keep building those connections!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling after our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much more confident about expressing myself in social situations. I even managed to share my thoughts during a group presentation, and my teammates appreciated it!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress and that your confidence is growing. How do you feel about that experience of sharing your thoughts in the group?

User: It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but once I started talking, it felt liberating. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did!

Consultant: It's great that you found joy in expressing yourself! Let’s explore that further. What do you think contributed to your feeling of liberation during the presentation?

User: I think it was the support from my group members. They seemed to listen and engage with my ideas, which made me feel valued.

Consultant: That support can make a significant difference. It sounds like you’ve begun to see that your voice matters. How does that realization impact your thoughts about future social interactions?

User: I feel more hopeful and less intimidated. I'm thinking that I might even participate more in class discussions!

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift in perspective! It sounds like you’re looking forward to engaging with your classmates. What concerns, if any, do you still have about participating in those discussions?

User: I still worry a bit about how I will be perceived by others, especially when I stumble over my words or if my ideas are dismissed.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries. Let’s unpack that a bit. When you think about stumbling over your words, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I start thinking that people will judge me or think I’m not smart enough.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're dealing with some self-critical thoughts in those moments. How might you challenge those thoughts when they arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect?

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Recognizing that imperfection is part of being human can really help ease the pressure. Could you also think about how you would support a friend if they were in your situation?

User: I would tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and focus on their strengths instead!

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same kindness to yourself. How would you feel about practicing these supportive thoughts before engaging in future discussions?

User: I think that could be helpful! I’ll try to remind myself of my strengths and to let go of the pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s explore some situations where you can practice engaging more actively. What opportunities do you see coming up soon?

User: There’s a group project starting next week, and I’m also considering joining a student club.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent opportunities to connect with others! How can you prepare yourself to take the initiative in those situations?

User: I could set small goals, like sharing at least one idea in the group project meetings. For the club, maybe I could introduce myself to a few members.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! They feel manageable and will allow you to build on your skills gradually. How do you feel about these upcoming opportunities?

User: I feel excited but a little nervous too. I hope I can stick to my plan.

Consultant: Feeling excited and nervous is completely normal, especially when stepping outside your comfort zone. How can you remind yourself of your past successes when those nerves creep in?

User: I can think about how I felt after the last presentation—validated and proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s a great memory to draw upon. Keeping that feeling in mind can boost your confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is the biggest takeaway for you?

User: I think it’s about being kind to myself and recognizing that growth happens step by step. I shouldn’t let fear hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, and I’m proud of how far you’ve come. Let’s continue to set goals and work on these strategies together. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel really good! I’m looking forward to applying what we talked about.

Consultant: Me too! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I’m here to support you. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I'm excited for our next session.
