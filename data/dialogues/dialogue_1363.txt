Consultant: Hello, Zhao. I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling quite conflicted about a complex relationship. Can you share a bit more about what's been going on?

User: Hello. Yes, I’ve been feeling really confused and guilty lately. I realized I have feelings for a married colleague, and while he has expressed some interest in me, he has no plans to leave his wife. This situation has been really troubling for me.

Consultant: That does sound like a challenging situation. It's understandable to feel conflicted when emotions and moral values are in turmoil. What do you find is the most difficult part of this experience for you?

User: I often feel guilty because I don't want to be someone who disrupts a family. At the same time, I can't ignore my feelings. It’s like I’m torn between what I want and what I believe is right.

Consultant: It sounds like you're wrestling with conflicting values—your own desires versus your moral beliefs. How does that internal conflict affect your daily life and your emotional state?

User: It’s exhausting. I find it hard to concentrate at work or even enjoy my time with friends. I feel this heavy weight of anxiety and confusion, and I constantly worry about what others might think of me.

Consultant: Feeling anxious and preoccupied can certainly take a toll on your overall wellbeing. Can you think of specific thoughts that arise when you're feeling this way? What do you tell yourself about this situation?

User: I often think things like, "I’m a bad person for having these feelings," or "I should know better." Those thoughts just amplify my guilt and make it harder to figure out what I really want.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh, and it's common to have negative self-talk in such situations. Let's explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these thoughts? For instance, is it true that having feelings makes you a bad person?

User: I suppose having feelings isn’t inherently bad. Many people have complicated emotions, right? But I just can’t shake that feeling of shame when I think about it.

Consultant: Absolutely, many people find themselves in complicated emotional situations. It’s important to recognize that emotions are natural and don’t define your character. Would it help to consider how you might perceive a friend in your position? What advice would you give them?

User: I think I’d tell them that it’s okay to feel what they feel, but they also need to consider the consequences of their actions. I guess I’m just really afraid of those consequences.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Acknowledging your feelings without judgment can lead to better clarity. Let's think about what those potential consequences look like for you. What do you fear most about acting on this attraction?

User: I'm scared that if I pursue anything, it’ll end in heartbreak for me, or worse, cause problems for his family. I don’t want to be the reason for someone else’s pain.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those concerns. You’re showing a lot of empathy for the situation. However, let's reflect on your own needs and desires, Zhao. What would it look like for you to take care of your emotional health while navigating this situation?

User: I suppose I need to set some boundaries for myself. Maybe I need to reassess whether I should maintain a close relationship with him or distance myself for my own peace of mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive step. Setting boundaries can help you maintain your emotional health. What kind of boundaries would you feel comfortable establishing?

User: I think limiting our interactions outside of work could be a good start. It might help me distance myself from my feelings while still being professional.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable approach. Limiting interaction could reduce the intensity of your feelings while allowing you to maintain professionalism. How do you think you might feel once you implement that boundary?

User: I hope it will relieve some of the pressure I feel right now. I think it’s essential for me to focus on my needs, and maybe it will help me feel less guilty.

Consultant: Focusing on your needs is essential for your emotional well-being. Remember, taking care of yourself is not selfish. You deserve to be happy and at peace. As you move forward, what strategies do you think could help you manage the guilt and anxiety that may arise?

User: I might need to remind myself that it’s okay to feel conflicted and talk it out with friends who support me. Reflecting on my values seems crucial too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Reflecting on your values can guide you in making decisions that align with who you are. How do you feel about these approaches moving forward into the next few weeks?

User: I feel a bit more empowered. It’s nice to acknowledge that I have control over my emotions and decisions. I’ll give these strategies a try and see how I feel.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Empowerment is key in addressing emotional challenges. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about yourself and the next steps you're planning to take.

User: I’ve realized I need to be kinder to myself, recognize my emotions without judgment, and set boundaries that prioritize my well-being. I’m going to work on limiting my interactions with him and reflect more on my values.

Consultant: You’ve articulated your insights beautifully, Zhao. Remember that it's okay to navigate these feelings and that seeking a balance is a healthy approach. As you implement these changes, how do you plan to check in with yourself?

User: I can keep a journal to document my feelings and reflections, which might help me track my progress and stay mindful of my emotions.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Journaling can be a very effective tool for self-discovery and emotional regulation. Remember, you’re doing your best, and it’s okay to ask for help when needed. If ever you feel overwhelmed, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you, that makes me feel supported. I appreciate our conversation today; it’s helped me clarify a lot.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhao! Feel free to reach out anytime if you need support or want to discuss your progress. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how things evolve for you!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep in touch.
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhao, I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my interactions with my male colleague. I feel confused and anxious about where our relationship is heading. Sometimes I wish things could be clearer.

Consultant: It sounds like this relationship is weighing heavily on your mind. You desire clarity and perhaps a sense of control over the situation. Can you tell me more about the specific feelings you have when you're with him?

User: I feel drawn to him, but at the same time, there's this underlying anxiety. I'm not sure if I want to keep things as they are or set some boundaries. It's like a constant tug-of-war inside me.

Consultant: That tug-of-war sounds very challenging. On one hand, you want to keep the connection, but on the other hand, it brings anxiety. What do you think might happen if you were to set those boundaries?

User: I'm worried that if I set boundaries, he might pull away or be upset. But I also think that if I don’t, I’ll continue feeling anxious and uncertain.

Consultant: It's understandable that you're concerned about his reaction, but it's also important to consider your own emotional well-being. Can you identify what exactly you want from this relationship?

User: I want to feel secure and less anxious. I think I need to communicate more openly about what I want, but I’m terrified of ruining things.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Wanting security is a valid need. Let’s explore together how to express your feelings and needs without feeling overwhelmed. What would be a first step you could take?

User: Maybe I could start by expressing that I appreciate our time together, but also mention that I need to understand where we both stand. 

Consultant: That's a great starting point! By expressing appreciation, you keep the tone positive. How do you think he might respond to you sharing your need for clarity?

User: I honestly don’t know. He seems confused about his own feelings too, so it could go either way.

Consultant: It's okay not to know how he might react. Focus on what you can control—your own feelings and your own message. What do you think are some thoughts that could help reduce your anxiety before this conversation?

User: I guess thinking that it's okay to express my needs and that his reaction doesn’t reflect my worth might help. 

Consultant: Yes, reframing your thoughts like that is very powerful. Remember, your feelings and needs are important. What are some other steps you can take to prepare yourself for the conversation?

User: I could practice what I want to say, maybe even write it down. That would make me feel a bit more confident.

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts can be a great way to clarify them and prepare emotionally. As you think about this, how does it feel to know you're taking proactive steps?

User: It helps a little. I feel like I'm at least trying to take control of the situation instead of just letting it happen.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! Taking control is a sign of growth. Have you thought about what boundaries you would like to establish if you both agree to continue the relationship?

User: I think I’d want to set limits on how often we meet outside of work. I need to keep some space to assess my feelings.

Consultant: Establishing limits is a healthy approach. It allows you to evaluate your feelings while maintaining a connection. How do you feel about having this conversation in the coming days?

User: I’m still a bit nervous, but I feel more prepared now. I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Embracing your feelings of nerves while still moving forward shows courage. Is there anything else you want to discuss or tackle before our session ends?

User: I just want to make sure I manage my feelings no matter how he responds. I don’t want to feel like I'm losing myself again.

Consultant: That's an important consideration. Remember, regardless of his response, your self-worth is not determined by this relationship. We can work on strategies to help you maintain that sense of self. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I would like that support in dealing with whatever happens next.

Consultant: Great! We’ll continue to explore those strategies in future sessions. It sounds like you’re making significant progress in understanding your feelings and establishing boundaries. Keep reminding yourself of the strength you possess. How do you feel about what we've accomplished today?

User: I feel hopeful. I have a plan now, and I think I can approach this with more confidence.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! As we wrap up today, what’s the one takeaway you want to hold onto from our session?

User: I want to remember that expressing my needs is okay, and that it's important to keep focusing on my own well-being.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Zhao. Emphasizing your needs and well-being will guide you in not only this situation but also in future relationships. If you need support, I’m here for you anytime. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on my feelings, especially about my expectations from myself and others. It's been a bit overwhelming at times.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when navigating emotional expectations. Can you share more about what specific feelings or situations have been challenging for you recently?

User: Well, I attended a psychology workshop, and it opened my eyes to some things about emotions and relationships. But now I feel this pressure to implement everything I've learned, which is stressing me out even more.

Consultant: It sounds like the workshop provided you with valuable insights, but the pressure to change quickly can be quite heavy. What changes do you feel you need to make, and what are your thoughts on this pressure?

User: I want to express my feelings better in my friendships, but I worry people will judge me or not understand. The fear of rejection is still very much there.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can be really tough to handle. Let's talk about your expectations when you express your feelings. What do you hope to achieve when you open up to your friends?

User: I guess I hope for deeper connections and understanding, but I'm scared they might not respond well. It makes me hesitant.

Consultant: Seeking deeper connections is a beautiful goal. When you think about opening up, what specific thoughts come to your mind about how your friends might react?

User: I often think they'll find me too emotional or that they won't care about what I have to say. That leads me to keep my thoughts to myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel quite isolating. Let's challenge those a bit—what evidence do you have that your friends would react negatively? Have there been times they've been supportive in the past?

User: Yes, there have been moments when they listened and offered help. I guess I just focus on the negative possibilities.

Consultant: That's a common tendency, Zhao. It's important to notice when our thoughts lean towards the negative. What if we looked at those past supportive moments as evidence that opening up can lead to positive experiences?

User: I can see that! It's just hard to shift my mindset in the moment.

Consultant: It takes practice, for sure. Perhaps we can come up with some strategies for when you start to feel that fear of judgment creeping in. What do you think could help you remind yourself of the positives?

User: Maybe I could write down those supportive moments and read them when I feel anxious about sharing my feelings. Would that work?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Creating a list of positive experiences can reinforce your confidence. How about also thinking of a small situation where you could test expressing a feeling with a friend? 

User: I think I could try mentioning something light, like how I felt after the workshop, and see how they respond.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s a gradual way to practice sharing. After you do this, we can discuss how it felt and what you learned from that interaction. How does that sound?

User: I feel more encouraged about trying that! I think starting small might really help.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to take small steps. In addition to sharing your feelings, how do you plan to handle any anxieties that pop up before or during sharing?

User: I think acknowledging my anxiety and reminding myself to breathe could help. Visualization of a positive reaction might work too!

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Visualization can really help in easing anxiety. What do you think could be a reassuring phrase to tell yourself when you're feeling anxious about sharing?

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay to be vulnerable, and my feelings are valid," would help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation. Keep that close. Let's also talk about how to manage your expectations with your friends. What do you hope they take away from your sharing?

User: I want them to understand me better, but I also know they might not have all the answers. It’s tough to balance that.

Consultant: It is tough, and it's fantastic that you recognize that. Remember, your aim is connection, not necessarily resolving every issue. How might that shift your approach in conversations?

User: I guess I would feel less pressure to perform perfectly and just focus on being genuine.

Consultant: Definitely! Prioritizing authenticity over perfection can relieve a lot of that pressure. As you prepare to express yourself, reflect on how you want to feel rather than focusing solely on how your friends might respond.

User: I like that perspective. It feels lighter to think about how I want to express rather than the outcome.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. Let's keep using this perspective as we move forward. When it's time to share, remember to focus on your feelings, and take it step by step.

User: I appreciate this guidance. I feel more optimistic about opening up now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Zhao! You've already taken significant steps by being willing to express your feelings. Let’s revisit this in our next session and reflect on the experiences you’ve had.

User: Sounds good! Thank you for all the support. I'm looking forward to trying this out.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited to hear how it goes. Remember, feel free to reach out if you need any support before our next meeting. 

User: I will! Thank you again for everything. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been making some positive changes lately. How are you feeling about your recent experiences with social activities?

User: Hi! It's been quite uplifting. Participating in the team collaboration at the company event made me feel more engaged. I even joined a book club, which is something I hadn't done in a long time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re embracing new experiences and connecting with others, which can truly enhance your emotional well-being. How did you feel when you participated in those activities?

User: I felt excited. For a while, I was hesitant about socializing, but now I enjoy expressing myself and sharing my thoughts with others.

Consultant: That's a significant shift from your previous feelings. What do you think has contributed to this change in your attitude toward social interactions?

User: I believe it’s partly because I’ve realized the joy that comes from sharing experiences with others. Being able to express my thoughts makes me feel valued, and I enjoy the connection it creates.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to recognize the importance of expressing your thoughts and feelings. What are some specific moments or interactions that made you feel particularly valued in these recent activities?

User: At the book club, there were moments when people genuinely listened to my opinions, and they expressed their appreciation for my insights. It felt nice to be included in the discussions.

Consultant: Being heard and appreciated can be incredibly affirming. Have you noticed any changes in how you view your own self-worth as a result of these interactions?

User: Yes, definitely. I used to doubt my contributions, but now I feel more confident that what I say matters. It seems like I have something valuable to offer to conversations.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Confidence in your contributions can greatly enhance your sense of self-worth. Are there any challenges you still face when it comes to expressing yourself or engaging with others?

User: Sometimes I still feel a little anxious before meetings or social gatherings. I worry about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about social situations. Let’s explore that anxiety together. Can you share what thoughts typically go through your mind right before these events?

User: I usually think, “What if nobody wants to hear what I have to say?” or “What if I embarrass myself?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally when you think them?

User: They make me feel nervous and sometimes even a bit discouraged. I want to push through it, but it’s tough.

Consultant: I understand. It can be hard to combat those negative thoughts. What if we challenge those beliefs? How much evidence do you have that supports the idea that people wouldn’t want to hear what you have to say?

User: Well, I guess there have been times when people have listened and engaged with me. It’s just my worries cloud my judgment.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. So, there are positive experiences that contradict those anxious thoughts. How would you feel if you were to replace those negative thoughts with more supportive ones?

User: I think that would help. Maybe thinking, “My thoughts are valid and worth sharing” could make a difference.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive mindset shift! Let’s practice that. Next time you’re preparing for a social event, try reminding yourself that your insights are valuable. What do you think you could say to yourself to reinforce that belief?

User: I could say, “I have important thoughts to share, and I’ll be open to hearing others too.”

Consultant: Exactly! That kind of self-affirmation can be powerful. Additionally, have you considered any small steps to further engage with others, perhaps by initiating conversations or sharing your opinions more frequently?

User: Yes, I want to start being more proactive. Maybe I can ask open-ended questions to others at the book club to keep the conversation flowing.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Asking questions can not only show your interest in others but also alleviate some pressure off yourself. How does the idea of initiating conversations make you feel?

User: It feels a bit daunting, but I think it could also be exciting. I like the idea of being more involved.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit anxious about stepping out of your comfort zone. Just remember, each small interaction is a step towards building those connections. How do you plan to approach your next social gathering?

User: I’m going to remind myself to enjoy the moment and focus on the conversations instead of worrying about how I come across.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Focusing on the experience rather than self-judgment can really enhance your enjoyment. As we wrap up today's session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about yourself. What do you feel has been your biggest insight today?

User: I’ve realized that my thoughts do not always reflect reality, and I have the ability to shape my self-perception. I’m feeling more optimistic about socializing now.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! Keeping that positive perspective can help you fully enjoy your interactions. Would you like to set any specific goals or strategies to continue practicing these ideas?

User: Yes, I want to keep reminding myself to enjoy speaking up and to ask more questions. I’ll also try to recall the positive feedback I’ve received.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Remember, every conversation is an opportunity for growth. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Always feel welcome to return if you want to discuss further or share your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’m looking forward to what comes next!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you today. I’d like to hear more about your recent experiences, especially after attending that outdoor activity. How did it feel to connect with new people?

User: Hi! It was actually really wonderful. I felt a sense of joy that I haven’t experienced in a long time. I made some new friends, and we shared quite a few laughs. It was refreshing to be around others.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It’s wonderful to hear you felt joy and laughter in a social setting. What do you think contributed most to those feelings?

User: I think just being outside and engaging with people who were also looking to have fun made a big difference. I realized that my fears of social interactions had diminished.

Consultant: It seems like the environment and the company helped you feel at ease. How do you feel about exploring more of these social interactions in your life moving forward?

User: I would love that! I want to find more opportunities where I can meet people and maybe join some groups or activities. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Engaging in activities with others can be very fulfilling. Can you think of any particular groups or events you might be interested in?

User: I used to enjoy book clubs and going to art exhibitions. Maybe I could look into local groups for those interests.

Consultant: Those sound like great options! Not only do they align with your interests, but they also provide an opportunity for meaningful connections. How would attending such events make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel excited and also a bit nervous, but mostly excited. I miss having those enriching experiences.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Could we work on a small plan for you to gradually incorporate these activities into your life?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I’d appreciate having some direction on how to approach this.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by identifying one activity you can commit to in the coming week. How about finding a local book club to attend? 

User: That sounds doable. I could search online for a couple of options right after this session.

Consultant: Excellent! Once you find a couple of options, think about which one seems more appealing to you. Connecting with the right group can enhance your experience. How are you feeling about taking this next step?

User: I feel optimistic about it. It's nice to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re already benefiting from envisioning these interactions. As you prepare to reach out to these groups, let’s explore any concerns or doubts you might have.

User: Well, I guess my biggest concern is if I won't fit in or if things get awkward. 

Consultant: That's a common concern in social situations. Often, people worry about fitting in, but remember, everyone is there to connect and enjoy the experience. What alternative thought could you have instead of focusing on fitting in?

User: I suppose I could think that I might make new friends, and it’s okay not to connect with everyone. It’s just about enjoying the moment.

Consultant: I love that perspective! Focusing on the joy of the moment rather than the outcome can be liberating. Can you think of a situation in the past where you surprised yourself by connecting with someone unexpectedly?

User: Yes, during the outdoor event, I connected with a few people when I least expected it. I thought it wouldn’t happen, but it did!

Consultant: That’s a perfect example. It demonstrates your ability to connect when you’re open to the experience. How can we remind you of this success as you venture into new social settings?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my experiences to reflect on afterwards. I could write about the positive interactions I have.

Consultant: An excellent idea! Journaling can help you focus on the positives and reinforce your progress. Would you consider setting aside time for that after each interaction?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. It sounds like a great way to keep track of my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! As our time is coming to an end today, let’s summarize your goals. You aim to find a book club, engage in new social activities, and maintain a journal of your experiences, right?

User: Exactly! I feel clear about those goals now.

Consultant: Wonderful! Before we wrap up, I want to commend you on your willingness to embrace these activities. It shows growth and courage. How confident do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel quite confident! It feels good to have a plan in place.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, it's okay to feel both excitement and some nerves as you step into these new interactions. You’re capable of managing these feelings. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to sharing my progress.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I can sense some positive changes in myself and in my interactions with others. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've been making significant progress. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in your social interactions?

User: I've taken more initiative in organizing gatherings with my new friends. I feel supported by them and it really boosts my confidence.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’ve taken on a leadership role in your social circle. How does this make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel proud and more open. It’s nice to see that I can connect with people and build meaningful relationships.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement! It seems you’re developing a sense of belonging. Have you found any strategies that help maintain this positive feeling?

User: Yes, I’ve been trying to stay in touch regularly with my friends. Also, I consciously remind myself of the good moments we share together.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Reflecting on positive experiences can really strengthen your sense of confidence. How do you think you can build on this moving forward?

User: I think I could plan more activities, maybe even some volunteer work. It's a good way to meet new people and contribute to the community.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in volunteer work can provide a sense of purpose and further enhance your social connections. What kind of activities are you interested in?

User: I’ve always had an interest in helping animals, so maybe I can find a local shelter to volunteer at.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful choice, Zhao! Helping animals can be very fulfilling. How do you think this might affect your emotional well-being?

User: I believe it will make me feel happier and more connected. It’s rewarding to help those in need.

Consultant: Absolutely! And it sounds like it aligns well with your goals of maintaining a positive emotional state. How do you plan to incorporate this into your schedule?

User: I’ll try to dedicate a couple of weekends each month for volunteering. That way, it won’t feel overwhelming.

Consultant: Setting a manageable schedule is key. It shows you’re taking a sustainable approach to your personal growth. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far in our sessions together?

User: I feel really good about it! I’ve learned a lot about myself and what I need to feel fulfilled. It’s empowering.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Let’s take a moment to reflect on some strategies that have worked for you. Which techniques have you found most helpful in maintaining your emotional health?

User: I think the practice of journaling my feelings has been very helpful. It helps me process experiences and recognize patterns.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. How do you envision continuing this practice in the future?

User: I plan to keep writing, especially after social events. It helps me appreciate the good times and learn from the challenges.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Reflecting on your experiences can enhance your resilience. As we wrap up, let’s think about potential challenges you might face. What could help you stay on track when times get tough?

User: I suppose reminding myself of my growth and the support I have now will help. Also, I could keep close contact with my friends.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Having a strong support network and a self-reminder system will certainly help sustain your emotional health. Have you thought about any other resources you might explore?

User: Not at the moment, but I’m open to suggestions.

Consultant: Perhaps reading books or joining workshops related to personal development could be beneficial. They can introduce you to new ideas and further support your growth.

User: That sounds good! I’ll look into that.

Consultant: Fantastic! As we conclude our session today, I’d like to remind you of how far you’ve come. Your ability to reach out and form connections is a significant milestone.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance throughout this journey.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure supporting you, Zhao. Remember, the tools you've learned are always with you. You’ve got the skills to continue thriving, and I believe you’ll do great. 

User: Thank you! I feel ready to take on the future.

Consultant: I'm confident you are. If you ever feel you need to come back for support, know that you’re always welcome. Today’s session concludes our work together, and I wish you all the best on your journey ahead!

User: Thank you so much! I will keep that in mind.
