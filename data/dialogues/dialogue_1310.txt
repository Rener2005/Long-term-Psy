Consultant: Hello! It's good to see you today. I understand you've been going through a tough time recently. Could you share with me how you've been feeling?

User: Hello. I've been feeling really down lately. The pain from my shingles is really bothering me, and it seems to be affecting my mood and how I deal with daily life. I just feel so helpless.

Consultant: I hear you. That sensation of helplessness can be very overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with physical pain. Let’s talk about the emotions you're experiencing. What specific feelings come up for you when the pain intensifies?

User: I feel anxious and frustrated. Sometimes I just wish the pain would go away so I could enjoy the little things in life, like reading or chatting with others.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Pain can certainly take away joy from activities we once enjoyed. When you think about those moments when you're in pain, what thoughts seem to run through your mind?

User: I often think that I will never get better and that I'll always be in this state. It makes me feel more trapped in this situation.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. It seems like there’s a strong sense of hopelessness tied to your experience. Let's explore this a bit—do you think there are moments or situations where you might feel a little more hopeful or engaged, even despite the pain?

User: I suppose there are rare moments when I don't feel the pain as strongly, like when someone visits me and we talk. But those moments seem so fleeting.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It sounds like social connections can bring some relief, even if it’s temporary. Let’s think about your thoughts—what evidence do you have that you will never get better? Are there any small signs of improvement that you might have noticed?

User: I guess I can move around a bit more than when I first got the shingles. But the pain still lingers, so it’s hard to hold onto that thought.

Consultant: That’s a good observation! While the pain may still be present, recognizing even small improvements can be beneficial. It’s about adjusting how you perceive your progress. Do you think there might be ways to remind yourself of those little victories?

User: I could keep a journal or something to note the days when I feel a bit better. But sometimes I worry that it might just remind me of how often I feel pain.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It's important to find a balance. How about we consider using the journal to highlight not only the pain but also the moments of relief, however small they may be? It might allow you to see a fuller picture over time.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I want to find ways to cope better and not be overwhelmed by the pain.

Consultant: Absolutely! Coping is key. Along with journaling, we can also explore some relaxation techniques together that may help reduce your anxiety and improve your emotional state. Would you be interested in trying some simple methods?

User: Yes, I would like that. It sounds helpful to have some strategies.

Consultant: Great! One technique that many find useful is deep breathing. It can help activate your body’s relaxation response. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise together?

User: Sure, I can give that a go.

Consultant: Alright, let's start by finding a comfortable position. Close your eyes gently if it feels right. Take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a moment. Now slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times. Inhale… and exhale… 

User: That actually feels nice. It calms me down a bit.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a wonderful tool to help manage anxiety. As you continue to practice, you might find it easier to use during moments of heightened pain or distress. How do you feel about incorporating this practice into your daily routine?

User: I can see that being helpful. I could try doing it every morning.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely plan! Establishing a routine can create a sense of stability. Remember, it's also about being gentle with yourself during this process. If some days are tougher than others, that’s okay. How do you feel about exploring more techniques in our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I feel a bit more hopeful about finding ways to manage my feelings.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a positive step forward. Today, we’ve started identifying how your emotions connect with your physical experience. As we move forward, we can continue to challenge those overwhelming thoughts and introduce more coping strategies. You’re doing wonderfully by participating in this process.

User: Thank you, that really means a lot. I want to keep working on this.

Consultant: That determination is what can make a difference. As we wrap up today, remember to keep track of those moments of relief, and don't hesitate to return if you need more support. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you so much for your help. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care, and I look forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today’s session. I want to start by checking in with you—how have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hello. I'm still coping with the pain from the shingles. It's been quite tough, and I feel quite frustrated. The pain and itchiness are always there, making it hard for me to eat or sleep properly.

Consultant: I can see how challenging that must be for you. It's understandable to feel frustrated when dealing with ongoing discomfort. What kind of thoughts are coming to your mind about your situation?

User: I keep thinking that the pain will never go away and that this is going to ruin my life. I feel so helpless and anxious about what this means for my health and my future.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts are really overwhelming for you right now. Let’s explore that a bit—what evidence do you have that this pain will last indefinitely? Have there been times when you’ve experienced relief?

User: I suppose there have been moments when the pain wasn’t as severe, but those moments feel so rare. Often, it just seems to stay there, nagging at me.

Consultant: It’s good to acknowledge those moments of relief, even if they feel brief. What if we tried to focus more on those times when you felt less pain? How might thinking of that affect how you feel now?

User: I don’t know... maybe it would help to remind myself that there are brief moments of relief. I just feel so consumed by the discomfort.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Pain can be quite consuming. Can we try to identify how you might challenge those negative thoughts? If a friend were going through a similar experience, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to feel frustrated but that it’s also important to hold onto hope and remember that pain sometimes goes away. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a compassionate view. It’s essential to allow yourself to feel those emotions but also to recognize the potential for better days. What are some small steps you could take to cultivate that mindset in your day-to-day life?

User: Maybe I could start by tracking my pain levels and noting any good moments? That could help me see that it's not constant.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal to note your experiences can help you have a clearer picture of those fluctuations. How do you think you might feel if you start doing that?

User: I think it could help me feel more in control, like I'm acknowledging both the bad and the good. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Feeling more in control can make a significant difference in your emotional well-being. Additionally, would you be open to practicing some relaxation techniques together that can help when the pain feels overwhelming?

User: I would like that. I’ve heard about deep breathing and muscle relaxation, but I'm not sure how to do them correctly.

Consultant: Let’s try a simple deep breathing exercise right now. Take a deep breath in through your nose, expanding your belly, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together. 

User: Okay, I’m trying... Inhale... and exhale... It feels nice to focus on my breath for a moment.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Focusing on your breath can be very grounding. How did that make you feel just now?

User: It took my mind off the pain for a little bit, which is refreshing. I guess I can see how deep breathing could help when I’m feeling anxious or uncomfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a useful tool to have in your toolbox. As you practice it more, it can help you manage those feelings of discomfort. Are there other specific situations where you think this might be helpful?

User: Yes, like when I feel the pain escalating or I can’t fall asleep. 

Consultant: Those are excellent moments to integrate deep breathing. Besides the breathing exercises, would you be interested in learning about progressive muscle relaxation as well?

User: Yes, I’d like to know more about it. 

Consultant: Great! Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. It can help reduce tension throughout your body. Would you like to try a brief session together?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Let’s start with your feet. Tense the muscles in your feet for a count of five, and then release. Notice the difference in tension. Can you do that?

User: I’m doing it... and now I feel the difference. It’s nice to let go of that tension.

Consultant: Excellent! Now let’s move up to your legs and repeat the process. This practice can help you become more aware of bodily sensations and redirect your focus when you feel discomfort.

User: I think I could manage that. It sounds like it could be helpful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about building a repertoire of techniques you can use. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. How do you feel about the strategies we talked about today?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I like the idea of tracking my pain, and I’m excited to try the breathing and muscle relaxation exercises.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It’s all about taking small steps. Remember, you have the strength within you to navigate this challenge. We’ll check in on your progress next time. Keep practicing, and I look forward to our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hello. I've been feeling quite low. The pain from the shingles hasn't improved, and it really worries me. I’m not sure if I'll recover, and it's just hard to feel hopeful.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It must be really challenging to deal with the pain and the uncertainty about your recovery. Can you tell me more about the pain and how it’s affecting your daily life?

User: The pain is like sharp needles, mostly on the left side of my neck. It's painful enough to make me not want to do anything. I also feel less interested in eating, and I’m struggling to sleep at night.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially with everything you're going through. It's understandable that pain can take a toll on your mood and even your appetite. What do you think you can do to feel a little more at ease during this time?

User: I don't know... It just feels overwhelming. Sometimes I think it might never get better, and that thought makes everything worse.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those feelings, especially when you're in pain. However, let’s take a moment to explore that thought—what evidence do you have to support the idea that it will never get better?

User: I guess there's no real proof. It just feels like it’s been so long, and the treatment hasn’t worked.

Consultant: I understand. The duration of your pain and the lack of visible improvement can make you feel stuck. However, let's think of past experiences—have there been times when you faced health challenges and eventually felt better?

User: Yes, I had some other issues before that eventually improved, but this feels different. I guess I just don’t see a way forward.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way, but let's try to remember those moments of recovery. They show us that healing is possible, even if it seems distant now. What positive steps do you think you could take to help yourself in this situation?

User: Maybe I could try to spend some time with others more often or engage in some activities I used to enjoy, even if it's just a little.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging with others can significantly help lift your mood. What activities do you think you might enjoy returning to, even in a small way?

User: I used to love talking with friends and playing games. I miss that, but I worry about the pain.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about pain, but maybe we could create a plan where you can engage in those activities in a way that's gentle and manageable for you. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, that sounds okay. I think having a plan might help me feel a bit more in control.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s outline some small steps you can take when you feel able. Perhaps starting with a short phone call to a friend or playing a simple game could be a good first step. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds doable. I can try that.

Consultant: Great! As you try these things, remember to acknowledge the effort you're making. It's all part of your healing journey. How do you feel about the idea of reaching out to friends?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. Maybe talking to them could help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a valid feeling. It’s a positive step toward connection, which can help reduce feelings of isolation. What reassurance could you give yourself if you start feeling anxious about reaching out?

User: I guess I could remind myself that they care about me and would want to see me feel better.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of that support can be comforting. Would you like to set a goal for when you might reach out to that friend?

User: Maybe I could aim to do it this week. That sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan! It’s important to give yourself achievable goals. What else can we discuss today that might help improve your mood?

User: Well, sometimes I think about how I can cope with the pain better. Any suggestions?

Consultant: Definitely! Finding ways to cope with pain can be beneficial. We can explore relaxation techniques or gentle physical activities that might help ease the discomfort. Have you tried anything like that before?

User: I haven't really tried much. I feel too tired.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Starting small can help. How about a short daily practice of deep breathing or listening to soothing music? It could be a gentle way to help with relaxation and distraction.

User: That sounds nice. I could probably manage a few minutes of that each day.

Consultant: Perfect! Just a few minutes can make a difference. As you begin this practice, how do you think it may impact your feelings towards the pain?

User: If I can relax a little, maybe I won’t feel the pain as intensely.

Consultant: That’s a strong insight. Finding moments of calm can certainly help shift your focus. As we wrap up today, can you share what you’ve found to be the most useful from our conversation?

User: I think planning small activities and using relaxation might help. I feel a bit more hopeful about coping with this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. I’m here to support you in this journey. How do you feel about our next session? 

User: I’m looking forward to it. I feel like I have some tools to work with until then.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I believe you’ll do great with these steps. Take care, and we’ll talk again soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our conversation. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better actually. I've opened up more during my conversations with the caregivers. But I still struggle with this pain, and sometimes it feels quite overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better and are more open to discussing your feelings. Pain can indeed be challenging, especially when it affects your daily life. Can you tell me more about how the pain affects your emotions and interactions with others?

User: Well, when the pain strikes, I often feel like isolating myself. It just makes me feel drained and low. But when I'm with the other residents in group activities, I manage to forget about it for a little while.

Consultant: It sounds like being in group activities helps you distract from the pain, which is wonderful. It’s important to have those moments of connection. Could you share what specific aspects of being with others bring you some relief?

User: I enjoy the laughter and just chatting with them. Even though the pain is still there, being around others makes me forget about it, at least for a bit.

Consultant: That’s such a positive realization—you’re finding joy and connection in social interactions. Let’s explore this further. How does participating in these activities influence your feelings about the pain afterward?

User: After activities, I feel lighter somehow, like I can deal with the pain better. But when I’m alone, it’s tougher to cope.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve experienced this lighter feeling. It seems that social engagement really supports you emotionally. What might help you to seek out and engage in more of these activities?

User: I think I need to remind myself how important it is to be around others. Sometimes I just feel so tired and want to rest instead.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Rest is crucial, but it’s also important to maintain those social connections. Can we consider some small steps you could take to balance rest and social interaction?

User: Maybe I can set a goal to join at least one group activity each week? That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Joining a group activity each week can help maintain that social connection and might alleviate some of your feelings of isolation. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it. It feels manageable, and I think it will motivate me to be more active.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you start this plan, let’s think about how you can remind yourself to follow through when you feel the urge to isolate. What methods do you think could work for you?

User: Maybe I could set reminders on my phone or ask one of the caregivers to help encourage me to go.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Setting reminders and having someone encourage you can provide that extra push. What kind of activities are you most looking forward to participating in?

User: I think I would enjoy arts and crafts again. I used to love that before the pain got worse.

Consultant: Arts and crafts sound wonderful! It’s a creative outlet and a way to connect with others. How do you think engaging in this activity might impact your mood?

User: I believe it would lift my spirits. It’s something I used to look forward to, and I think creating something would distract me from the pain.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Engaging in something you enjoy can be a great way to manage pain and enhance your mood. Let's plan to discuss how your next group activity goes during our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to sharing my experience.

Consultant: Excellent! Before we finish today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve identified the importance of social interactions in managing your pain, set a goal to participate in a group activity weekly, and found ways to remind yourself to follow through. Anything else you'd like to add?

User: No, that covers it all. I feel encouraged to start this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that you’re feeling encouraged. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. You’re doing wonderfully. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. You’ve made great progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Until next time, take care of yourself, and remember the importance of those social connections. I’ll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more stable emotionally since I started using the music therapy and meditation. The pain is still there, but I think the new techniques are helping me manage it a bit better.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're open to exploring these new methods. Can you share more about how music therapy and meditation have made a difference for you?

User: Well, I've noticed that when I listen to music, it distracts me from the pain. It lifts my mood a little, which is nice. Meditation has been challenging, but I can feel moments of calmness amid the discomfort.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've found some moments of calm through meditation. It can indeed be challenging. What do you think is making it harder to meditate consistently?

User: Sometimes my mind wanders a lot, and I struggle to focus. Plus, the pain can be distracting when I try to calm myself.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Pain can be a significant distraction. Would you like to explore some techniques that might help you stay focused during meditation?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that! I really want to make the most out of these practices.

Consultant: One technique we can try is focusing on your breath. When your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your breathing. Have you tried this approach before?

User: I’ve heard about it, but I haven’t really practiced it. I usually just sit quietly and try to empty my mind.

Consultant: Focusing on your breath can actually help ground you in the moment without the pressure to empty your mind completely. Would you be open to trying this during our session right now for a few minutes?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment together. Sit comfortably, and we'll breathe in slowly through your nose... and now out through your mouth. Let’s do this a couple more times, focusing on the sensation of your breath.

*...a few moments of guided breathing...*

Consultant: How did that feel for you just now?

User: It felt nice! I noticed some of the tension easing up, at least for a moment.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Focusing on the breath can be a powerful tool. How do you think you can incorporate this technique into your daily practice?

User: I think I could set aside a few minutes each day, especially when I feel that needle-like pain coming on.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating a dedicated time could make it easier to remember. Would you consider journaling about your experiences after each session?

User: Yes, I could write down how I feel before and after. It might help me see the progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of your feelings before and after your practice can provide insight into what works best for you. How do you feel about documenting your progress like this? 

User: I feel good about it. It gives me a way to be intentional about my practice.

Consultant: Excellent! It sounds like you’re taking proactive steps. Let's build on this. Besides music therapy and meditation, are there other activities you enjoy or find comforting?

User: I like to draw sometimes. It's something I can do that helps me escape a bit.

Consultant: Drawing can be a fantastic outlet for your emotions and can help distract from pain. Would you like to explore incorporating drawing into your routine alongside your other practices?

User: Definitely! I feel like it could be a nice balance with the meditation.

Consultant: I agree! Perhaps you could sketch or doodle after your meditation session. This way, you can express what you feel during and after your practice.

User: That sounds like a good idea. It would be interesting to see how my feelings translate onto paper.

Consultant: I'm glad you like it! Tracking your emotions through drawing could also be therapeutic. What else can we explore today to enhance your coping strategies?

User: I guess I want to talk more about the pain. Sometimes it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s important to address. Can you share what thoughts come to mind when the pain feels overwhelming?

User: I often think that I will never feel normal again. It's like a dark cloud over me.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts add to your pain. Let’s challenge that thought together. Is there evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you won’t feel normal again?

User: I guess there have been moments, even during the pain, when I felt okay. But the negative thoughts just come back.

Consultant: It’s common for negative thoughts to resurface, especially when you're dealing with pain. How about we work on reframing that thought? Instead of “I will never feel normal again,” could it be more like, “I’m experiencing pain now, but I can still have moments of feeling okay”?

User: Yes, I like that perspective! It feels more hopeful.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in thinking! Embracing moments of hope can help you navigate through tough times. Let’s keep building on those positive thoughts. 

User: I really appreciate that. It makes me feel less trapped by the pain.

Consultant: You’re doing an amazing job focusing on the positive. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress we've made?

User: I feel that I’m on a better path. The techniques and discussions have helped me feel more empowered to handle my feelings and the pain.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Let’s summarize what you plan to do moving forward. You'll continue with music therapy and meditation, incorporate focused breathing, journal your experiences, and explore drawing regularly. 

User: Yes, I think that will give me a well-rounded approach!

Consultant: Perfect! Keep practicing these strategies, and remember, it’s okay to seek support whenever you need. How do you feel about our next steps?

User: I feel excited! I have some hope now, and I actually want to share my experiences with others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Sharing can reinforce your positive experiences and inspire others. Remember, you’ve made significant strides. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always come back to discuss it.

User: Thank you for your support. I'm looking forward to next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm really interested to hear how you’ve been feeling since our last session. Can you share some updates with me? 

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit better, actually. The pain from the shingles seems to have eased up a little, and I've even started participating in some support groups with the other patients.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re managing the pain more effectively and finding a sense of community. How has participating in the support groups made you feel?

User: It’s been really uplifting. Talking to others who are going through similar experiences helps me feel less alone. I even shared some of my own experiences.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’ve taken that step to share your experiences. Connecting with others can be incredibly healing. What has been the most rewarding part of those interactions for you?

User: Listening to their stories makes me feel like I’m contributing something. It’s also nice to know I’m not the only one dealing with these issues.

Consultant: That sense of contribution and connection can be very powerful. It seems like you’re building a supportive network. Let’s reflect on your progress—what changes have you noticed in your feelings or outlook since we started working together?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I used to be really low, but now I have more positive thoughts about my situation. 

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Positive thinking can greatly impact your emotional well-being. Can you think of any specific strategies or practices that have helped you nurture that positivity?

User: I try to focus on small things that make me happy, like talking with the other patients and spending time outside when the weather is nice.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Emphasizing the small joys in life can create a ripple effect on your overall mood. Let’s discuss how you can maintain this positive outlook. Do you have any ideas on how to keep this going?

User: I think I want to set some small goals for myself, like attending the support group regularly and maybe getting involved in activities they do. 

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals can definitely help you stay engaged. It also reinforces your progress. What kind of activities do you think would interest you within those groups?

User: They sometimes have art sessions or light exercises. I enjoy being creative, so that sounds appealing.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in creative activities can be a great way to express yourself and manage emotions. How do you feel about incorporating art into your routine?

User: I feel excited about it! I haven’t tried drawing or painting in a long time, but I really used to enjoy it.

Consultant: It’s lovely that you remember enjoying it. Reconnecting with activities that bring you joy can be healing. Considering your progress, how do you see your emotional management evolving as you participate in these activities and groups?

User: I think I will feel more connected and focused. It also gives me a way to express my feelings instead of bottling them up. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Expression is key to processing emotions. Let’s also look at maintaining communication with the nursing staff—how do you feel about sharing your needs and feelings with them?

User: I’ve been a bit hesitant, but I realize it's important for my care. I think I can start by being more open about my pain and how I'm feeling emotionally.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Open communication with your caregivers can ensure you receive the support you need. What steps can you take to begin that conversation?

User: Maybe I can start with some small check-ins. Just telling them how I'm doing day-to-day.

Consultant: Small steps are totally effective! Keeping them informed can greatly enhance your care experience. As we wrap up our session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your greatest achievement during our time together?

User: I think it’s learning to communicate better and finding ways to cope with my feelings. I feel more empowered.

Consultant: That’s an incredible achievement! You’ve worked hard to develop these skills. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If challenges arise, you have the tools to manage them. How confident are you in applying what you’ve learned moving forward?

User: I feel very confident! I’m actually looking forward to continuing on this path.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! As we conclude today’s session, I encourage you to keep practicing these strategies and engaging with your support system. Always know you can reach out if you need additional guidance or support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I feel so much better equipped now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress, and I believe in your ability to navigate your feelings and experiences. Take care, and don’t hesitate to come back if you need to talk again in the future!
