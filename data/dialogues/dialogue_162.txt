Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I want to create a safe space for you. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the graduation events coming up?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really nervous. I keep thinking about the graduation party and how I might have to speak in front of everyone. It scares me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like the thought of speaking in front of others is causing you a lot of anxiety. That's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel scared about that situation?

User: I just feel like everyone will be looking at me, and I won't know what to say. What if I forget my words or just can't speak at all? 

Consultant: That fear of forgetting your words in front of others can feel overwhelming. It’s important to recognize that many people share similar anxieties. Have you had any experiences in the past where you felt this way? 

User: Well, I remember during class presentations, I would freeze and only say a few things. My heart would race, and I wanted to disappear. 

Consultant: I can imagine how distressing that must have felt for you. It seems like those past experiences might be contributing to your fear now. What do you usually tell yourself in those moments when you feel anxious?

User: I usually think that I’m going to mess up or that everyone thinks I’m silly for being quiet. It makes it even harder to speak at all.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really add to your anxiety. It seems like you’re being quite hard on yourself. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that people think you’re silly for being quiet?

User: I don’t have any proof, but I just feel that way. It’s like I have a voice in my head telling me I’ll mess things up.

Consultant: That internal voice can be very powerful and often not based on reality. If a friend were to come to you with similar feelings, how would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to just try their best and not worry so much about what others think.

Consultant: That's a compassionate approach to take for a friend. Perhaps you can remind yourself of those kind words when you're in a similar situation. In preparing for the graduation party, what steps could you take to feel more comfortable? 

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand. It might help me feel less scared.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a great idea! It can build your confidence and make you feel more prepared. What if we set up some small practice goals for you leading up to the party?

User: That would help, I think. I could try talking in front of my family first, and then maybe a few friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Starting small with your family and friends will allow you to build confidence gradually. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel a little better, like maybe I can actually do it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about taking small steps. And I’m here to support you through this. What else would you like to share about your feelings regarding the upcoming changes?

User: I worry a lot about not fitting in at the new school. I’ve always been shy, and I don’t know how to make friends easily. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way when facing new environments. Building new friendships can be intimidating. What do you think has made it hard for you to connect with others in the past?

User: I guess I just don’t know how to start conversations. Sometimes I feel like my thoughts get stuck, and I can't get the words out.

Consultant: It sounds like the fear of not being able to express yourself is holding you back. Let’s explore some simple strategies to help you start conversations when you meet new people at school.

User: That could be helpful. I want to be able to talk to new friends.

Consultant: One approach could be to start with simple greetings or compliments. You might also consider asking a question about something you notice. This can help break the ice. Would you like to brainstorm some questions together?

User: Yes, I think that would be good.

Consultant: Great! How about starting with questions related to school, like asking about favorite subjects or activities? This could help you find common interests.

User: I like that idea! I can ask about subjects we both like.

Consultant: Perfect! This could also help you practice being more social. Remember, it’s okay if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly; the goal is just to connect. How do you feel about practicing this before you start school?

User: I feel more confident about trying it now. It seems easier when I have something to say.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Building on these strategies will make it easier for you to engage with new peers. As our session comes to an end, let’s highlight what you’ve learned today and how you'll prepare for the graduation party.

User: I learned that I can practice speaking out loud and start conversations with questions. I feel less scared about trying.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, you’re taking steps towards overcoming your fears, and you’re not alone in this process. I believe in you and your ability to succeed. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyu! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support before then. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling about the upcoming graduation party at school?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about it. I really want to participate, but I'm really nervous about speaking in front of everyone. What if I freeze up or can’t get the words out?

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling both excited and anxious about the event. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel nervous when you think about speaking in public?

User: I worry that people will judge me if I mess up. I always feel like everyone's watching and waiting for me to say something, and that just makes it worse.

Consultant: That’s a very understandable fear. When you think about people watching and judging, what kind of thoughts come to your mind? What do you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think, "What if I forget what to say?" or "What if I sound stupid?" It just makes me want to avoid talking altogether.

Consultant: It's common to have thoughts like that when feeling anxious. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally in those moments?

User: They make me feel anxious and overwhelmed, like I can't breathe. It makes me want to just stay silent instead.

Consultant: I can see how that would make it really difficult to express yourself. Let’s explore those thoughts together. Can we identify if there might be a different way to view those situations? What evidence do you have that supports those worries?

User: I don't really have any proof that people would judge me badly. Most of the time, I think it's just in my head, but it feels so real.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiaoyu. Sometimes our thoughts can trick us into thinking things are worse than they are. If we look at this from a different angle, what might you say to a friend who was in your position? 

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that people aren’t really paying that much attention. They would understand.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It seems like you have a compassionate side. How might you apply that advice to yourself when you start to feel anxious about speaking?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, and that everyone has been nervous before. I guess I could try talking to myself more kindly.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Now, let’s talk about the graduation party. What small, achievable goals do you think you could set for yourself to help ease you into speaking in front of others?

User: Maybe I could practice introducing myself to a small group of classmates first before the main event?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Practicing in a smaller, familiar setting can help build your confidence. Would you want to role-play how that introduction might go?

User: Yes, I think that would help! It feels less scary to practice it with you.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you. Let’s say you’re introducing yourself to a small group. How might you start that conversation?

User: I guess I could say, “Hi everyone, I’m Xiaoyu and I’m really excited about the graduation party!” 

Consultant: That’s a lovely opening! It’s positive and sets a friendly tone. How do you feel about saying that?

User: It feels a little scary but also exciting! 

Consultant: That’s a great response! Feeling scared but excited is totally normal. Would you like to create a plan for practicing this introduction a few times to feel more comfortable?

User: Yes, I would like that. Maybe I could practice with my grandma before the party.

Consultant: Practicing with someone you trust is a great idea! How about scheduling a few practice sessions this week? You can even include how you want to react if you feel anxious while speaking. 

User: That sounds helpful! I think I could practice at least twice this week.

Consultant: Perfect! By doing this, you’ll be gradually exposing yourself to the situation, which will likely help reduce your anxiety over time. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel like I have a plan. I think it’ll help me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’re taking steps to support yourself. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Just trust in your preparation. How about we check in next session about how the practices went?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to see if I can improve before the graduation day.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. You’re doing really well, Xiaoyu. Remember, each small step counts. You’re building a bridge to more confident communication!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Progress takes time, and you’re on the right track. Keep believing in yourself, and I’m excited for our next session. 

User: Thanks! I’ll see you then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better because I tried speaking during the group activity, and my classmates said nice things. But I still find it hard to talk freely sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a positive experience in the group! That's fantastic to hear. Can you tell me more about what you felt during that activity?

User: I felt happy when they appreciated my input. But right before speaking, I was really nervous and worried they wouldn’t understand me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when you're trying something new. It's great that you still spoke up. How do you think you can build on that experience for future activities?

User: I think I could try to prepare what I want to say beforehand, but I'm not sure if that will help in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Preparing can definitely help you feel more confident. Can we also explore together how you might handle those nervous feelings when they come up?

User: Yeah, I’d like that. Sometimes I just freeze and can’t think of anything to say.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments can be quite overwhelming. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that go through your mind when you start to feel frozen?

User: I often think that everyone is waiting for me to say something and that I might say something silly.

Consultant: That thought can definitely create a lot of pressure. Let’s reframe that a bit—what if we considered that your classmates are actually eager to hear what you have to say, rather than waiting to judge you?

User: I guess that makes sense. They really were encouraging.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of their support can help diminish that pressure. Let's talk about a small step you could take next time you're in a new environment. What do you think you could try?

User: Maybe I could start by saying just a few words or asking questions; that feels less scary.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with small contributions can definitely ease the tension. How about we brainstorm a few questions you could use to engage others?

User: Yeah, like asking them about their favorite topics or things we can do together!

Consultant: Perfect! Those kinds of questions are inviting and easy to start with. It encourages conversation naturally. How do you feel about trying this approach in your next group setting?

User: I feel a bit more excited now! It seems manageable when I think about it this way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about taking those small steps. If you ever feel nervous, just remind yourself of the positive feedback you've already received. It’s powerful!

User: That really helps. I’ll keep practicing those questions too!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also think about how you can continue to build that confidence. Maybe after each interaction, you can take a moment to reflect on what went well.

User: Good idea! I can write down the positive things I experience after talking.

Consultant: Excellent! Keeping a journal of your successes can be a great way to reinforce your progress. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I love it! It’ll help me see how far I’ve come.

Consultant: Exactly! Tracking your journey will remind you of your growth and potential. Is there anything else you’d like to share today about your experiences or feelings?

User: I think I've shared a lot already. I’m just really grateful for the support.

Consultant: I'm here to support you, and I'm proud of the steps you've already taken. Before we finish today, let's review what you’ll focus on until our next session.

User: I will try engaging with small talk, ask questions, and journal my experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to feel a little nervous—that’s part of the process. You've got this. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoyu! It’s amazing to see how far you've come. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Me too! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I’m really glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some exciting changes in your communication. Can you tell me more about your recent experience in the reading group?

User: Hi! Yes, I was really nervous at first, but I shared my thoughts on the book, and everyone listened to me. It felt nice to get positive feedback from my teacher and classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like sharing your thoughts was a really encouraging experience for you. How did it feel to express yourself in that group setting?

User: It felt good, but I still feel nervous when I think about talking in front of people. I worry they won’t understand me or that I’ll mess up.

Consultant: I can understand why you might feel that way. It’s common to feel nervous about speaking in front of others, especially after just starting to share your thoughts. Can you describe what goes through your mind when you start to feel nervous?

User: I usually think that everyone is judging me, or that I’ll forget what I wanted to say. Sometimes I wonder why I even tried to speak up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging. It seems like they hold you back from enjoying the communication experience. What if we could challenge those thoughts together? For instance, could there be other explanations for what your classmates think when you speak?

User: I guess I don’t really know what they think. They might actually enjoy hearing my ideas, but I just assume the worst.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoyu! It’s good that you can recognize that assumption. If a friend was feeling the way you do about speaking in front of people, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably encourage them and say that it’s okay to be nervous and that it’s brave to share their thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a lovely perspective! You’re showing kindness to your friend that you might not show yourself. How do you think you could apply that same support to yourself when you feel nervous?

User: I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous, and that sharing my thoughts is a good thing, even if I mess up.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a powerful shift to treat yourself with that same compassion. Now, let’s think about some strategies you might use in new situations. Are there any common scenarios coming up where you might need to communicate more?

User: I’ll be starting junior high soon, and I’m worried about group projects and speaking up in class.

Consultant: That’s a big transition! How about we role-play a situation where you share your ideas in a group project? This could be a great way to prepare you for that experience.

User: Sure! I think practicing could help me feel more ready.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re in a group discussing a project. You could start by introducing your ideas. How would you begin?

User: I guess I would say something like, “I think we could do our project on a topic that interests us all.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! You’re not only expressing your idea, but also inviting others to contribute. How might you feel after saying that?

User: I think I would feel relieved and a bit proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling to aspire to! Remember that sense of accomplishment as we move forward. Are there any specific thoughts that come to mind when you think about saying that in real life?

User: I am still afraid of how others will react, but I really want to feel that pride.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have those fears. Let’s focus on that pride! Whenever you start feeling anxious thoughts, try recalling that positive feeling of sharing your ideas. What other techniques do you think might help ease your nerves?

User: Maybe taking deep breaths before I speak? I’ve heard that can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be a great way to calm your nerves. Let’s practice that together now. Inhale deeply… and exhale slowly. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice! I think I could use that before I talk to others.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a powerful tool for grounding yourself. As we continue, let’s recap the progress you’ve made today. What are some key takeaways you want to remember going forward?

User: I want to remember to be kind to myself, practice deep breathing, and look at speaking as an opportunity, not something scary.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It’s all about building on the progress you’ve made. Before we wrap up, how confident do you feel about using your new communication skills in junior high?

User: I feel pretty confident! I know it won’t be easy all the time, but I’m excited to try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! I believe in your ability to communicate with confidence. Remember, you can always return here if you need more support. You’ve come a long way, and I’m so proud of your progress, Xiaoyu!

User: Thank you! It was really helpful talking to you today. I feel more prepared for junior high now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember to celebrate your achievements, and I look forward to hearing about your success in the future. Have a great day!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! It's great to see you again. I’m excited to hear about your recent experiences, especially since you've made such progress. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really proud of myself! I spoke in front of my classmates during the public speaking event, and they liked what I said. It was amazing!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you had a very successful experience. Can you share what that felt like for you during and after the speech?

Consultant: That's a great insight! Developing your communication skills is so important. Let’s explore some ways to continue building on this experience. What specific situations do you think you might encounter in middle school where you’d want to use your speaking skills?

User: I guess there will be more class discussions and presentations. I want to participate more in group work too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Participating in class discussions and group work is a fantastic way to use your voice. How can you prepare yourself for those situations? 

User: Maybe I can practice speaking in front of a mirror or with my grandma. That might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Practicing in front of a mirror or with someone you trust, like your grandma, is an excellent idea. It will help you build confidence. Have you thought about any specific topics or ideas you’d like to talk about during these discussions?

User: I really enjoy talking about animals and my school projects. I think I could share a lot about those.

Consultant: Those are great topics to share! When you talk about something you’re passionate about, it usually makes it easier. How about setting a goal to speak on one of those topics in your upcoming classes?

User: Yes! I’d love to do that. It would feel good to share something I love.

Consultant: I love your enthusiasm! Let’s also think about how to handle any anxiety that might come up before speaking. What can you do to calm yourself if you start feeling nervous?

User: Maybe I can take deep breaths and remind myself that I'm prepared and know my topic well.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a very effective technique! And reminding yourself of your preparation will definitely help. How do you feel about trying this practice next time you have an opportunity to speak?

User: I feel good about it! I think it will help. 

Consultant: That's a positive mindset, Xiaoyu! Let’s also reflect on your achievements. How has your confidence changed since our first sessions together?

User: I feel much more confident now! I used to be scared to talk, but now I know I can do it.

Consultant: It’s incredible to hear how far you’ve come! Celebrating your progress is essential. Are there any specific techniques or tools we've discussed that you find most helpful in boosting your confidence?

User: I really like the idea of practicing and visualizing myself doing well. That makes me feel stronger.

Consultant: Visualization can be a powerful tool. As you move forward, think about using that technique regularly. Let’s take a moment to summarize your progress and what you’ve learned.

User: I’ve learned that I can speak and share my thoughts. I can prepare and practice, and I should remember to breathe when I get nervous. 

Consultant: Exactly! Those are valuable skills, and it sounds like you're ready for the next steps. As we prepare to conclude our sessions, how do you feel about your journey and your communication growth?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited about speaking in middle school. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaoyu! Remember, if you ever feel unsure, you can always revisit the strategies we've discussed. Any final thoughts or questions you’d like to share before we finish?

User: I just want to thank you! I feel like I can do this now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for all your hard work. As you continue this journey, remember that you can always reach out for support if you need it. You've got this! 

User: Thank you!

Consultant: Take care, Xiaoyu! It's been a pleasure working with you. Goodbye for now, and good luck with all your future speaking endeavors!
