Consultant: Hello, Xinyi! I’m glad to see you today. I understand you've been experiencing some difficult emotions lately. Can you share more about how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi. Lately, I just feel really anxious and sad. I lost a close friend, and even though I've been accepted to university, I can’t seem to shake off this heavy feeling. It’s like I have a cloud over me all the time, and I’m scared of certain words or images reminding me of everything.

Consultant: I hear you, Xinyi. Losing someone close can create a profound sense of loss and sadness. It's understandable that even positive events, like being accepted to university, can feel overshadowed by grief. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling this way?

User: Sometimes I think I should be happier since I got into university, but instead, I just feel this emptiness. I think about my friend's absence all the time. It's like I'm letting everyone down by not being excited.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a real conflict between what you think you should feel and what you're actually feeling. That's tough. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come up when you feel this way, especially when you compare your happiness to what you think it should be?

User: I often think, "Why can’t you just be happy like everyone else?" I feel like I’m failing at moving on, and that makes me even more anxious.

Consultant: That's a heavy burden to carry, Xinyi. Those thoughts can be very harsh. Let's explore that a bit more. What evidence do you have that you're failing to move on? Are there any moments where you notice even small bits of joy or progress?

User: I guess I had a good moment last week when I was with some friends, but then I felt guilty for enjoying myself. My thoughts kept saying I shouldn’t be having fun when my friend isn’t here.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel guilty about enjoying life after such a loss. However, it's important to remember that you can honor your friend while still allowing yourself to experience happiness. If a good friend was in your situation, what would you tell them about enjoying moments of joy despite their grief?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to feel happy sometimes. I guess I wouldn’t want them to feel guilty about it.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about allowing space for both grief and joy in your life. What if we try to reframe that guilt into something more compassionate towards yourself? How might that change your perspective?

User: I can try to remind myself that feeling good doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten my friend. It just means I’m living my life.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight. Let's also talk about some practical steps. Have you considered any activities that might help you cope with both your grief and your stress, like journaling or talking to someone about your feelings?

User: I haven’t really thought about journaling or anything like that. I usually just keep everything bottled up.

Consultant: Bottling things up can be overwhelming. Journaling can be a safe way to express your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Would you be open to trying it as a way to process your emotions?

User: I can give it a try. I think writing it down might help me organize my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a great decision, Xinyi. Another idea is to set small, manageable goals for yourself each day, including things that you enjoy doing. What’s something small you can commit to this week that might bring you a bit of joy?

User: Maybe I could go for a walk in the park. I used to love that, and it might help clear my head.

Consultant: A walk in the park sounds wonderful! Nature can really help in calming the mind and lifting the spirits. Let’s aim for that. Also, while we’re at it, have you talked to someone about your feelings, like family or friends?

User: I haven’t really talked to anyone. I don’t want to burden them with my problems.

Consultant: Sharing can relieve some of that burden, and friends or family often want to be there for you. They might surprise you with their support. How do you feel about potentially reaching out to someone you trust?

User: It seems scary, but maybe it would help. I’ll think about it.

Consultant: That’s a healthy first step, Xinyi. It’s perfectly okay to take your time. Also, I want to remind you that it’s okay to experience those feelings without rushing to fix them. Acknowledging them is the first part of the journey.

User: Yeah, I suppose just recognizing that I’m feeling this way is part of it?

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing your feelings is a powerful tool. Let’s also think about how to cope with the thoughts that arise when you feel overwhelmed. How would you respond the next time you feel that pressure to be happy?

User: I think I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel sad and that I’m human, which is a part of life.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate way to treat yourself. Holding space for your emotions is important, and all feelings are valid. As we wrap up today, let's revisit some of the things we’ve discussed. How do you feel about your progress and the steps we’ve set for you?

User: I feel a bit lighter. I like the idea of journaling and going for a walk. It feels good to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re taking significant steps in understanding your feelings and coping with your grief. Remember, it’s a process. When we meet next, we can check in on your journaling and how the walk went. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xinyi! Take care of yourself, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xinyi! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been a bit up and down, to be honest. The pressure from school and my classmates is really getting to me. I feel like I have to maintain this perfect image, and it's overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand that the expectations from school and peers can feel quite heavy. It sounds like you’re holding yourself to a very high standard. Can you tell me more about what specific situations have triggered those feelings recently?

User: Well, during our class gathering, I could really sense the weight of everyone’s expectations. It made me feel anxious, like everyone was watching me, and I had to perform perfectly.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful. Feeling like you’re under a spotlight can be incredibly daunting. What was going through your mind during the gathering?

User: I kept thinking that if I didn't look confident or if I didn't know all the answers, people would judge me. That made me anxious and I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: It seems like these thoughts are really impacting your ability to enjoy social situations. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. Can you identify what feelings emerged when you thought about being judged?

User: I felt a mix of fear and disappointment, mostly fear of not living up to others’ expectations. It’s like I’m afraid that if I mess up, it would confirm that I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It’s normal to fear judgment, but it can be quite heavy to carry those beliefs around. Let’s examine that fear a bit further. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you wouldn’t be good enough if you didn’t perform flawlessly?

User: I guess it’s just a feeling I have. I’ve always done well in school, and I feel like people expect me to keep that up. If I slip up, I might disappoint them.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re equating your worth with your performance. Let’s try to challenge that belief. If a friend of yours were in a similar position, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to not be perfect and that everyone has their off days. But I don’t seem to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It's harder to extend kindness to ourselves sometimes. Let’s think about some alternative thoughts you could replace that critical voice with. What could you tell yourself in that moment of pressure?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to be human and that my friends value me for who I am, not just my accomplishments.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a very compassionate way to view it. Now, let’s explore some practical steps you can take when you start feeling this way again. How about some relaxation techniques to manage your anxiety in social settings? 

User: That sounds good! What kind of techniques can I use?

Consultant: Well, one effective method is deep breathing. When you feel that anxiety building, taking deep, slow breaths can help calm your nervous system. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice together for a moment. Take a deep breath in for a count of four… hold it for a moment… and now breathe out slowly for a count of six. How does that feel?

User: It actually feels a bit calming. I think I could use that technique.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! With practice, it could become a helpful tool for you. One more thing—how do you feel about facing these social situations with this new mindset and relaxation technique?

User: I think it could make a difference. It feels good to have some strategies to cope.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you’re starting to see how to tackle these challenges more effectively. For our next session, it might be beneficial to discuss more about your experiences with social situations and how these techniques work for you. 

User: That sounds good. I want to focus on building more confidence in social settings.

Consultant: Wonderful! In our next session, we can dive deeper into those experiences and develop more strategies to boost your confidence. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: I appreciate that reminder. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xinyi! You’re taking important steps towards self-compassion and resilience. I look forward to our next conversation. Take care, and see you soon! 

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello, Yi, welcome to our session today! I’m glad you’re here. How have you been feeling lately about your upcoming transition to university?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. On one hand, I’m looking forward to university, but on the other hand, I worry I won’t be able to keep up with everyone’s expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot of anticipation but also some anxiety regarding these new responsibilities. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about meeting those expectations?

User: I’m afraid I won’t perform as well as I did in high school. My parents and teachers have always had high expectations for me, and I worry I might disappoint them.

Consultant: That’s understandable, especially since you have a history of excelling in school. It’s important to acknowledge those concerns. What does it feel like when you think about possibly not meeting those expectations?

User: I feel a tightness in my chest and it makes me want to avoid thinking about it altogether. Sometimes, I just can’t seem to sit down and focus on studying for my upcoming class.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling that tightness and wanting to avoid the situation. Let’s explore your thoughts a bit more. When you find it hard to focus, what thoughts cross your mind?

User: I start thinking that I’m not smart enough for university, or that everyone else will be better prepared than I am. 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem pretty heavy. It can be quite challenging when we think we might not be good enough. Can you notice how those thoughts make you feel? 

User: They make me feel even more anxious and sometimes a bit hopeless. I worry that if I feel this way now, I’ll definitely feel overwhelmed once I actually start.

Consultant: It makes sense that such thoughts would contribute to your anxiety. Let’s try to examine them more deeply. What evidence do you have that you won’t be able to cope or that you’re not smart enough?

User: I guess I don’t have real evidence; I’ve always done well in academics. It’s just this nagging feeling that I might fail.

Consultant: It's insightful that you pointed that out. Sometimes our thoughts misguide us even when we have evidence to the contrary. If a friend was in your position, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to believe in themselves and not focus too much on failures because everyone struggles at some point.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It might be helpful to start treating yourself with the same compassion you would show a friend. What would it mean for you to adopt that attitude towards your own situation?

User: I suppose it would be comforting to remind myself that it’s okay to face challenges and that I’m not alone. I think it would reduce some pressure I feel.

Consultant: Absolutely, recognizing that challenges are a normal part of any growth experience can lessen some pressure. Would it be helpful to think of specific times when you’ve faced challenges and successfully navigated them?

User: Yes! I was really nervous when I had to go back to school after my health issues, but I ended up doing fine. I guess I’ve managed before!

Consultant: That’s a powerful example! You showed resilience during a tough time. How might you use that experience to help you with your upcoming transition?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve faced difficulties before and I can do it again. Maybe I need to build my confidence with that in mind.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy. Building on your past experiences of resilience can reinforce your self-efficacy. Let's think about some new, realistic expectations you can set for yourself as you enter university.

User: Maybe I could set a goal to just take things one step at a time instead of trying to be perfect right from the beginning.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive approach. Breaking things down into manageable steps can help you feel less overwhelmed. What’s one small step you could take this week to prepare for university?

User: I could reach out to some current university students and ask them about what to expect. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Connecting with others can offer insights and alleviate some anxiety by knowing you’re not alone in this. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit excited! It’s nice to think I could gain some perspective from their experiences.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yi! It’s great to see you feeling a bit more optimistic. As we move toward concluding our session, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made today. What do you think are the most important takeaways?

User: I realize that my worries about expectations are mostly unfounded and that I’ve handled difficulty before. I can be kinder to myself about the transition.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights, and I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. As you continue on, what strategies do you think will help maintain this positive outlook?

User: I think reminding myself of my successes and reaching out for support when I need it will be helpful.

Consultant: Those are solid strategies. As our session comes to a close, remember, it’s okay to have doubts, but you also have strengths to draw upon. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to seek help. You’re doing great, and I believe in your ability to navigate this new chapter. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. It feels relieving to talk about all this. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yi! I’ve enjoyed our conversation today. Remember, I’m here whenever you need to talk or seek guidance. Good luck with taking those next steps forward!

Consultant: Hello, Xinyi! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a mix of things. I think I’m a bit more relaxed about my future, especially after discussing with my family. But sometimes I still doubt my abilities.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel a bit more relaxed about your future. Let’s explore that doubt a bit deeper. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you doubt your abilities?

User: I sometimes think that maybe I'm not as good as everyone thinks I am. Like, I struggle with some subjects, and I fear my parents will be disappointed if I don’t perform perfectly in university.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging to cope with. It’s understandable to feel pressure when others have high expectations. How does thinking that way affect your emotions and motivation in your studies?

User: I feel anxious and overwhelmed, which makes it even harder to study. When I think about disappointing my parents, I just want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a cycle there—doubt leading to anxiety, which in turn leads to avoidance. Let’s take a moment to reflect on this: when you think about disappointing your parents, is there any evidence that supports that worry, or could there be other explanations?

User: Well, I know my parents care about me and want what's best. They’ve told me they are proud of my achievements, but I still can’t shake off the worry.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that their pride in you exists alongside your worries. Let's think about how you might approach discussions with them about your wishes and fears. How do you think you could express your feelings to them?

User: Maybe I could just tell them that I feel pressured and that I'm afraid of failing. I think they would understand.

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! Sharing your feelings openly can be a powerful way to communicate. Let’s practice a bit together. Imagine sitting down with your parents. How would you start this conversation?

User: I guess I would say something like, "I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure lately." 

Consultant: That's a fantastic opening. It shows appreciation while also expressing your emotions. How do you think this conversation could change the way you feel about their expectations?

User: I think it could help! If they know how I feel, I hope they won’t be as harsh on me and might give me the space to breathe.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s try to shift focus to building your confidence. What strengths do you have that you can remind yourself of, especially when you feel pressured?

User: I believe I’m good at organizing my studies and I can manage my time well. I’ve also maintained good grades despite my health issues.

Consultant: Those are definitely strengths to recognize and celebrate! How can you use these strengths to foster a more positive view of yourself moving forward?

User: I can remind myself that I’ve overcome challenges before and that I have a good foundation. I think I need to focus more on my efforts rather than just the outcomes.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective, Xinyi. Emphasizing your efforts can help reduce the fear of disappointing others. How will you apply this mindset in your upcoming studies?

User: I’ll set realistic goals for each study session and celebrate when I complete them, regardless of how much I understood.

Consultant: Wonderful approach! Setting those tasks will keep you focused and will help reinforce your self-efficacy. Would you feel comfortable continuing to share these strategies with your family?

User: Yes, I think they would be supportive if they understand my new goals.

Consultant: That’s a great intention! You're on the path to clearer communication with them. As we wrap up, what have you learned about yourself today that you can take with you?

User: I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself and that it’s okay to have these feelings. Talking about them could really help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xinyi. Remember, it’s a process, and being kind to yourself is a vital part of that journey. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and empowered. I think I can approach my family about how I feel now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You're taking meaningful steps towards self-understanding and communication. Keep practicing those strategies, and remember that I'm here to support you anytime you need. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xinyi. I look forward to our next session, and take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hi, Xin Yi! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more positive about myself. The discussion I had with my classmates really made me reflect on my self-worth. But I still want to make sure I keep that positive mindset and stay mentally healthy.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re feeling more positive about yourself! It sounds like you're really embracing self-reflection. Let’s talk about what maintaining that positivity looks like for you. What specific thoughts or feelings do you want to hold onto?

User: I want to continue feeling self-acceptance and not be too hard on myself. Also, I want to be open to different ideas and opinions from others, rather than feeling pressured to conform.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! It’s important to cultivate self-acceptance and openness. Can you share an instance where you felt pressured to conform, and how it affected you?

User: Recently, I felt pressured during group projects where some classmates had strong opinions. I found myself going along with them rather than voicing my own thoughts. It made me feel a little frustrated and less confident.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Xin Yi. Finding your voice in such situations can be tough. How has this experience influenced your thoughts about your own opinions and values?

User: It made me realize that I often doubt my own thoughts because I fear rejection. I want to work on speaking up more, but I sometimes feel anxious about how others will react.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious, especially when you value others’ opinions. Let’s explore how thinking about your reactions might help you in these scenarios. Can we try identifying any negative thoughts that come up for you when you think about speaking up?

User: I often think, "What if they don't agree with me?" or "Maybe my ideas aren't good enough." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. Let’s challenge them together. What evidence do you have to support those thoughts? Or could there be alternative explanations?

User: I suppose there isn’t much evidence. Sometimes, my classmates actually say they appreciate different viewpoints, but I still worry.

Consultant: That’s a positive insight! It sounds like your classmates value diversity in opinions. If a friend was in your shoes, what encouragement would you give them to express their thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that their opinions are valid and that sharing different views can lead to better discussions. 

Consultant: That's a supportive perspective! Now, let's bring that same encouragement to yourself. What could be a small step you can take to practice sharing your thoughts in your next group discussion?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing one idea at first. Just to test the waters and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Starting small can help you build confidence. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for your next group project?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited to try it. I want to feel less tense about it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable! Let's also discuss some strategies to manage that nervousness. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises before anxious situations?

User: I haven’t really tried those, but I’ve read about deep breathing exercises that can help.

Consultant: Deep breathing can indeed be very helpful! Let’s practice a simple deep breathing exercise together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for four. How does that feel for you?

User: That was calming! I can see how that might help reduce my tension before speaking up.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It can be a useful tool when facing anxiety. Regular practice can really enhance your comfort level. How about you incorporate this breathing technique before your next group project meeting?

User: Yes, I will definitely try that! I like the idea of preparing myself mentally before speaking.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also take a moment to reflect on how far you've come. How do you feel about your progress in self-acceptance and openness since we started our sessions?

User: I think I’ve made significant progress. I feel more aware of my thoughts and have actively tried to accept different perspectives. 

Consultant: That’s amazing progress, Xin Yi! It’s great to see you recognize your growth. Looking ahead, how do you want to continue developing these skills in your daily life?

User: I want to keep practicing speaking up and using the breathing techniques whenever I feel anxious. Also, I want to continue reflecting on my thoughts in a positive way.

Consultant: Those are fantastic plans! Keeping a journal might help you in this self-reflection process as well. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think that could really help me process my thoughts better.

Consultant: Great! Let’s summarize your goals for our next session: to practice speaking up in group discussions, utilize deep breathing before feeling anxious, and start journaling your reflections. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel optimistic about these goals. 

Consultant: I’m glad you feel optimistic! Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. As we conclude our session today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I have the ability to change my mindset and that my thoughts are valid. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve shown a lot of insight today. I'm proud of how far you've come. If you ever need support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, Xin Yi!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiayi! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more stable emotionally, and I think I'm starting to accept myself better. It's a relief to see a clearer and more positive outlook on my future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Self-acceptance and a positive outlook are such important steps. I'd like to discuss your recent experiences in the psychological workshop. How did that impact your feelings and mindset?

User: The workshop was really helpful! I felt a sense of relaxation that I hadn't experienced in a while. It made me realize that I can manage my emotions better.

Consultant: It's great to know that the workshop had a positive effect on you. What specific techniques or insights did you find most beneficial during the workshop?

User: They taught us some breathing techniques and mindfulness exercises. I felt calmer when I practiced them, which helps when I get stressed about school.

Consultant: Those techniques can be very powerful. How have you been applying them in your daily life since then?

User: I've been trying to use the breathing exercises before I study or when I feel overwhelmed. It actually helps me get into a better mindset.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It sounds like you've found a useful strategy to manage stress. As we assess your psychological growth and changes, what other aspects of your mental health would you like to explore today?

User: I want to reflect on what I've learned and how I can continue developing my mental health. I want some guidance on maintaining this positive trajectory.

Consultant: Absolutely, reflecting on your progress and creating a plan for the future is essential. What do you think the biggest change you've experienced has been since our last meeting?

User: I think I've learned to recognize when I'm starting to feel anxious and to address it before it gets overwhelming. I feel more empowered to take control of my feelings.

Consultant: That's a significant accomplishment! Empowerment is crucial in managing emotions. What specific strategies do you think you could incorporate into your routine to support this newfound empowerment?

User: I think I could set aside time each week to practice mindfulness and reflect on my emotions. Also, I could talk more openly with my parents about how I feel.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Setting aside dedicated time for mindfulness can strengthen your emotional awareness, and open communication with your parents can provide additional support. How do you feel about initiating these conversations with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it would be good for both me and them. They do care, even if sometimes their expectations feel overwhelming.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about such conversations. It shows that you care about the relationship. Perhaps we can brainstorm a few points you could mention when talking to them. What do you think might be important to share?

User: I want them to understand that while I appreciate their support, I also feel pressure from their expectations. I hope to express my need for open communication.

Consultant: That sounds like a very honest and constructive approach. By expressing your feelings and needs, you're setting the groundwork for a healthier dialogue. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go?

User: Yes, that could help! I want to feel more prepared and confident when I speak to them.

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s start the role-play. Imagine you’re sitting down with your parents. How would you start the conversation?

User: I think I might say something like, “I really value your support, but I've been feeling a lot of pressure lately...”

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It opens the door for a dialogue. How do you feel about their potential responses? 

User: I guess I worry that they might not understand or feel defensive. That makes me hesitant.

Consultant: Those concerns are valid. It might help to remind yourself that it’s a discussion, not an accusation. If they do respond defensively, how might you steer the conversation back to your feelings?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I understand that you want what’s best for me, and I appreciate that. I just want to share what I'm feeling too.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to pivot back to your experience. It reinforces that you’re on the same team. How confident do you feel about having this conversation now?

User: I feel a lot better about it! Practicing this helps me see that it’s possible to have a healthy discussion.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's summarize what we've discussed today to reinforce your progress. You’ve become more empowered in managing your anxiety, practiced mindfulness techniques, and are preparing to have an important conversation with your parents. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good! I appreciate the clarity on my progress and the steps I can take moving forward.

Consultant: You’re doing incredibly well, Xiayi. As we prepare to conclude our session, what do you believe would be the most helpful strategy for you to maintain this momentum?

User: I think it’s important for me to keep practicing mindfulness and to make time for those conversations with my parents regularly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan. Routine practice will solidify those techniques and enhance your emotional growth. As our sessions come to a close, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our time together?

User: I’ve learned that I can take charge of my mental health and that having support from my parents can really help me, as long as I communicate openly.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. Remember, you’ve made great strides in your mental health journey. As you move forward, keep using the tools you’ve developed. If you ever feel the need for support again, don't hesitate to reach out. You've got this!

User: Thank you so much! I feel ready to take on these challenges, and I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xiayi. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your journey ahead!
