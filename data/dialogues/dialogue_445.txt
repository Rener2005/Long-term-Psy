Consultant: Hi Li Ming! It's great to see you again. I want to talk about how you've been feeling since our last session. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Well, things have been really tough. My mom and I had another big fight. I'm scared I might have to leave home. I just feel so alone and panicked.

Consultant: That sounds really distressing, Li Ming. Feeling alone in such a critical situation can be overwhelming. Can you tell me what happened during that argument with your mom?

User: We were discussing my grades, and she just exploded. She said I wasn't taking school seriously. But I am trying! It’s like she doesn’t see my effort at all.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel misunderstood, and that must be really frustrating. When you say she doesn’t see your effort, what thoughts go through your mind about yourself in those moments?

User: I think maybe I’m just not good enough. Like, no matter what I do, it’s never enough for her. I feel like I disappoint her all the time.

Consultant: That’s really tough to carry, feeling like you’re disappointing someone you care about. What kind of emotions does that bring up for you?

User: A lot of sadness and anxiety. I worry about what that means for our relationship and whether she'll throw me out if things get worse.

Consultant: That's a heavy burden to bear. It’s understandable to feel anxious given the conflicts at home. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit more. Can you identify what specific thoughts make you feel most anxious about potentially being thrown out?

User: I think it’s the fear of being alone. Without my mom, I really don’t know what I would do. No one knows how I feel.

Consultant: Being afraid of loneliness is a common feeling, especially in a time of conflict. It’s important to acknowledge that fear. How do you typically cope with those feelings when they arise?

User: I usually just try to ignore them or distract myself with my phone or games, but it doesn't really help in the long run.

Consultant: Distraction can be a temporary relief, but it sounds like the anxiety still lingers. What if we tried to confront those feelings more directly? What thoughts come to mind when you think about how to have a conversation with your mom about your feelings?

User: I don’t know… I’m just really scared she’ll get angry again. I feel like I can’t communicate with her without it ending in a fight.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel apprehensive about communication, especially after a confrontation. What if we imagined a different approach—how might a calm conversation look like between you and your mom?

User: I guess I could try to explain how her anger makes me feel, but I'm not sure she would listen. 

Consultant: That's a brave step to consider! Expressing how her actions impact you could open the door to understanding. Let’s work on some phrases you could use. Would you like to role-play this conversation together?

User: Sure, I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Imagine I am your mom. You can start whenever you’re ready.

User: Mom, I wanted to talk about our last argument. I just feel really anxious when you get angry, and it makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: I see—it sounds like you’re feeling vulnerable. How can I support you better during those times?

User: Maybe if you could try to understand where I'm coming from instead of just reacting. I really want to do well, but I feel like I'm not enough sometimes.

Consultant: That’s very well put. By sharing your perspective with her, you create space for potential connection. Reflecting on this role-play, how does it feel to voice those thoughts?

User: It feels a little better to say it out loud. But I still worry about how she’ll react in reality.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It’s a process. It might help to remind yourself that you’re expressing needs, which is important for both of you. What if you practiced this more before a real conversation? 

User: Yeah, practicing might help. I’ve never thought of it that way.

Consultant: Exactly! This could build your confidence. Additionally, let’s work on identifying those negative thoughts about your self-worth. Can you recall any specific moments when you felt like you weren’t good enough?

User: Sometimes, when I don’t do well on tests, I feel like I’ve let everyone down.

Consultant: It’s common to tie your worth to your performance, but it’s crucial to recognize that your value is inherent. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the belief of not being good enough when you face challenges?

User: Well, I have done well in some subjects, and my friends say I’m a good person. 

Consultant: That’s excellent proof! You’ve shown resilience and qualities that matter. Let’s focus on reinforcing those positive thoughts. What affirmations could you use to remind yourself of your value?

User: I guess I can tell myself that I’m trying my best and that I’m worthy of love regardless of my grades.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Consistently affirming such beliefs can help reshape your mindset over time. It might also ease some of the anxiety around your relationship with your mom.

User: I hope so. I want to feel more confident in our relationship and with my friends too.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Li Ming. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it's recognizing that I can express my feelings without fear. And maybe it’s okay to seek understanding rather than just trying to avoid conflict.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, communication is a two-way street, and seeking understanding is a brave step. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. If you continue to practice these skills, I believe you’ll find more confidence in your relationships.

User: Thank you! It’s really helpful to talk this out and have someone listen.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Keep practicing those affirmations and communication techniques, and we can build on this in our next session. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Li Ming! 

User: Thanks! I appreciate it!
###################
Consultant: Hi Li Ming! I'm glad you're back for today's session. I remember we discussed your feelings about your mother's recent talks about moving. How have you been since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious. Even though the move hasn't happened, I can't shake the worry. I keep thinking about what it might mean for our family and for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of uncertainty surrounding your family's situation, which is understandable. Could you share more about what specific thoughts are causing you to feel anxious about the potential move?

User: I keep thinking about how it might change my routine and if I'll have to leave my friends behind. I also worry about whether my mother is okay with everything and if she sees me differently now.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns. You seem to be worried about changes and how they'll affect your relationships and routine. Have you been able to talk to your mother about how you feel regarding all this?

User: Not really. I’ve been too anxious to bring it up. I just keep wondering if I should even ask her. What if it makes things worse?

Consultant: It's natural to feel hesitant about starting that conversation. However, opening up about your feelings could help you understand your mother's intentions better. What do you think might happen if you were to share your concerns with her?

User: I guess I could find out what she really thinks and whether she feels the same way I do. But I also fear that the more I talk about it, the more stressed we both might become.

Consultant: That makes sense. The fear of increasing stress can be daunting. However, communication might also lead to reassurance. Is there a way you could approach the conversation gently, maybe by expressing your worries first?

User: Maybe I could start by telling her that I’m worried about how a move might affect us. I think I just need to find the right moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Finding a calm moment to express your feelings could open the door to understanding. What feelings come up for you when you think about having that conversation?

User: I feel a mix of relief and fear. Relief because I might finally know her thoughts, but fear because I can’t predict how she will react.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have mixed feelings. Relieving some of that anxiety might help. How do you usually cope with feelings of fear or uncertainty?

User: I often just avoid thinking about it or distract myself with games. But it doesn’t really help in the long run.

Consultant: Avoidance can sometimes feel easier, but it often leaves the underlying worries unaddressed. What if we explored some strategies to face those fears instead? 

User: I’m open to that. What do you suggest?

Consultant: We could try breaking down your fears into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, what specifically worries you about your mother's reaction? 

User: I worry she might feel pressured or upset. I don’t want her to think I’m blaming her for any decisions.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. You could express it by reassuring her that your intention is to understand her perspective rather than to blame her. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. Maybe explaining my feelings first can make it feel less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re already thinking critically about how to approach this situation, which shows growth. Have you thought about what you would like to say in that conversation?

User: I think I could say, "I want to talk about what I’ve been feeling about the move." But I’m still uncertain about how to start.

Consultant: Starting with "I" statements, like sharing your feelings about the move, helps set a personal tone. Remember that you're sharing your experiences rather than making demands. Would you like to practice how you might start that conversation?

User: Sure! I could say something like, "Mom, I’ve been feeling anxious about the idea of moving, and I’d like to share my thoughts." 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s open and honest. Practicing this can build your confidence. How do you feel about trying this in the coming days?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it. I’ll have to remind myself that it’s okay to express my feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Every step you take towards communication with your mother is a step towards clarity. How do you think you might cope with any unsettling feelings that arise after your talk?

User: I guess talking to friends could help. I’ve been avoiding them because I’ve been so focused on this worry.

Consultant: Connecting with friends can definitely provide support. You can share with them what you're going through, which may help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I think I’ll try to talk to one of them this weekend. I miss hanging out.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Balancing your feelings with social support could positively impact your mood. How do you think you might feel after reaching out to your friend?

User: I hope it’ll lift my spirits. Just sharing might take off some weight from my shoulders.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, sharing your experience can help lighten the emotional load. As we wrap up today, what do you see as your next steps following our discussion?

User: I’ll try to talk to my mother about my feelings regarding the move and reach out to my friends for support.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps forward, Li Ming! I believe you are capable of navigating these conversations. When we meet next, we can discuss how it went and any feelings that arose. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more prepared than before.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since I started to talk things through with my friends. But I still have this lingering feeling of insecurity. It’s like I’m afraid of being ignored again.

Consultant: It's good to hear that your communication with your friends has improved, but I can understand that lingering insecurity can be tough to deal with. What do you think contributes to that feeling of being ignored?

User: I think it has to do with some past experiences. Whenever there was a misunderstanding, I felt really left out. It's hard to shake off that feeling.

Consultant: That makes sense, Li Ming. Those past experiences can be hard to forget. Let's explore this together. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt ignored, and what thoughts went through your mind during that time?

User: Yeah, I remember one time when I was left out of a group chat. It made me think that maybe my friends don’t really care about me, and I felt really Sad.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel sad in that situation. It sounds like you connected your friends' actions with your self-worth. What kind of evidence do you have that suggests your friends don't care about you?

User: Well, they didn’t invite me to a few outings, that’s what I saw. But maybe I’m just overthinking it? 

Consultant: That could be a possibility. Our minds can sometimes jump to conclusions. If a friend of yours experienced similar situations, what advice would you give them about how to interpret their friends' actions?

User: I guess I would tell them not to take it personally and maybe ask their friends what’s going on.

Consultant: That's great advice! It shows that you recognize the importance of communication. How might that approach apply to your situation? 

User: I think I should talk to my friends and express how I feel. It might help clear up some misunderstandings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Clear communication can strengthen your relationships. Could you brainstorm some positive outcomes that might come from such conversations?

User: If I talk to them, I might feel more connected, and it could really help me feel less insecure. Maybe I’d realize that it wasn’t really about me.

Consultant: That sounds very promising! Taking that step could bring you valuable insights about your friendships. What specific actions can you take to initiate that conversation?

User: Maybe I could send a message to one of them and just be honest about how I've been feeling.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. What emotions do you anticipate experiencing when you take that step? 

User: I think I might feel nervous at first, but I also feel like it could be relieving in the end.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous, especially when discussing feelings. Are there any techniques you could use to manage that nervousness when reaching out to your friends?

User: I could try taking deep breaths before I send the message, or remind myself that it’s okay to be open.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a helpful strategy. I’m proud of you for considering ways to manage your emotions. Now, when you think about how you wish to feel in your friendships, what does that look like for you?

User: I want to feel valued and appreciated. Like I matter to them.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful goal, Li Ming. Feeling valued is important in any relationship. How might reaching out to your friends help you feel that way?

User: If they respond positively, it would definitely help boost my confidence, and I’d feel like I contribute to the friendship.

Consultant: Exactly! By engaging in open dialogue, you not only clarify misunderstandings but also show your friends that you value the relationship. As you work on this, how can you also remind yourself of your own worth? 

User: I could think of my strengths and what I bring to the friendship. I could make a list!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A list of your strengths can be a great reminder of your value. What’s one strength you would include right now?

User: I think I’m a good listener. I really care about what my friends have to say.

Consultant: Being a good listener is an invaluable strength in friendships. How do you think showing this quality can help enhance your relationships?

User: I think it helps my friends feel heard and valued, which in turn could strengthen our bond.

Consultant: Absolutely! Showing that you care can foster trust and openness. Now, reflecting on today’s discussion, what are your thoughts about your progress in building self-confidence?

User: I feel more positive about my ability to connect with my friends. I see that I have strengths I can leverage.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li Ming! Moving forward, how can you apply what we've talked about to continue boosting your self-confidence?

User: I’ll start by reaching out to my friends this week and remind myself of my worth. I also want to keep building on my strengths.

Consultant: Those are excellent action steps! Just remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. As we approach our closing for today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I’ve learned that I should communicate better and remind myself of my strengths. It feels good to talk about this!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li Ming! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. Remember, you already have the tools to strengthen your self-worth and relationships. I'm here for you whenever you need to talk again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about the new activities I joined at school. They made me feel like I have something to offer, but I still wonder if I'm really worth something.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been reflecting on these new activities and how they relate to your sense of self-worth. Can you share more about what these activities have brought to your life?

User: Well, I joined a club, and it feels nice to work with other people. I even got some compliments, which I didn’t expect. But sometimes I just doubt if I truly deserve them.

Consultant: It sounds like the club experience has opened up new opportunities for you, and those compliments are affirming. Let’s explore those doubts a bit. What thoughts come to your mind when you question your worth?

User: I usually think something like, "They are just being nice," or "They don't really mean it." It makes me feel like I’m pretending to fit in.

Consultant: I understand. It’s normal to question compliments, especially if you’re used to feeling uncertain about yourself. Have you considered what evidence supports or contradicts those thoughts of "not being deserving"?

User: Not really. I just dismiss the compliments because I feel like they don't know the real me.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern, Li Ming. It’s called cognitive distortion—when we see things in a way that isn’t quite accurate. Could we try listing some evidence that supports the idea that you do deserve those compliments?

User: I suppose I did work hard on our project, and my peers seemed to appreciate my contributions. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a significant achievement, and it shows that your efforts are recognized. How does acknowledging those contributions change how you feel about yourself?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident, but I still struggle to fully believe it.

Consultant: That’s a normal feeling. Building self-confidence takes time and practice. What if we think of ways to remind yourself of your accomplishments daily, to reinforce that belief?

User: I could write down some compliments or good things that happen each day. That might help me see it more clearly.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal of positive feedback can serve as a great reminder of your value. How do you think starting this journal would make you feel initially?

User: I think it might feel weird at first, but maybe it could help me.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Sometimes new practices can feel awkward at first. What if you set a small goal, like writing one positive thing each day? 

User: That sounds manageable. Just one thing each day feels doable.

Consultant: Perfect! Starting small is often the key to consistency. What’s another area in your life where you feel a need for more positive recognition or support?

User: I guess my relationship with my mom. We don't talk much about how we feel, and I wish we could connect better.

Consultant: It’s insightful of you to recognize that desire for connection. Improving communication with her could enhance your overall sense of support. Have you thought of ways to initiate deeper conversations with her?

User: I haven't really tried. I’m not sure how to bring it up without making her uncomfortable.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Maybe starting with how much you appreciate her support could be a gentle approach. You might express how you've been feeling more confident and want to share that with her. How does that sound?

User: I could try that. It might help her understand me better too.

Consultant: Yes! And encouraging open dialogue can create a positive space for both of you. What do you think would be the best time to have that conversation with her?

User: Maybe during dinner when we are more relaxed. It’s usually quieter then.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Setting a comfortable atmosphere can make it easier for both of you. How do you feel about approaching this conversation?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s a natural reaction, Li Ming. Feeling nervous is part of stepping into new territory. Remind yourself of your aims for connection and understanding when you approach her. 

User: I will. I think it can help our relationship if it goes well.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each step you take can strengthen that connection. Remember, open communication is a journey. How would you like to evaluate your progress on both your journal and the conversation with your mom in the coming sessions?

User: I’d like to share what I wrote in my journal and how the conversation went. I think that could help keep me accountable.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan, Li Ming. Accountability can be a powerful motivator. Let's aim to discuss your experiences with both pieces next time. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel like I have a clearer direction. Thanks for helping me think through these things!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, it’s all about the little steps forward. Keep being open to exploring your feelings. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts next time.

User: Me too! Thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hi Li Ming! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit better after the family event with my mom. It was nice to spend some time together, and I think our relationship is on the right track.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience helped you see things more positively. Can you share what specifically contributed to this change in your perspective?

User: Well, I guess we talked more openly than usual. It felt less tense, and I realized I miss having more of those moments with her.

Consultant: It sounds like open communication has had a positive impact on your relationship. How do you think you can continue to foster that openness moving forward?

User: I think I need to initiate conversations more often. Sometimes I hold back because I'm worried about how she might react.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's understandable to feel hesitant. Perhaps we can explore ways for you to feel more comfortable initiating those conversations. What would make you feel safer doing so?

User: I guess if I focus on expressing my feelings rather than avoiding tough topics, it might help. I just... sometimes I fear she won’t understand.

Consultant: It's great that you're considering expressing your feelings. When those fears pop up, how do they make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me anxious, and I often just shut down instead of speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction. It sounds like there’s a pattern of anxiety that holds you back from sharing. What do you think might help you to overcome that anxiety when it arises?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that it’s okay to express how I feel, and that it could actually strengthen our bond, I could push through that anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Reminding yourself of the potential positive outcomes can be powerful. Would you like to role-play a situation where you might express something important to your mom?

User: Sure! I think practicing might really help me to feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say you want to tell her about a recent experience at school that was bothering you. How would you start the conversation?

User: I could say something like, "Mom, there's something on my mind I’d like to share with you. It’s been weighing me down a bit."

Consultant: That’s a good opening. It’s clear and sets a respectful tone. How do you think she would respond to that?

User: I hope she would be open to listening, but I still worry she might feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that. How about adding a reassuring phrase to let her know you're seeking her support rather than just dropping heavy news on her?

User: Like, "I just need to talk through this with you, and I’d appreciate your support"?

Consultant: Exactly! That adds clarity to your intentions and might help her feel more comfortable. What do you think about that approach?

User: I think it makes me feel more confident. It gives me a clearer purpose for the conversation.

Consultant: Excellent! Confidence is key in communication. Let’s also discuss what you’d like to convey during the conversation. What’s the main point you’d want her to understand?

User: I want her to understand that school has been stressful for me and that I’m doing my best to manage everything.

Consultant: That’s an important point to make. Framing it as you adopting responsibility might alleviate her worry as well. How would you express that?

User: Maybe I could say, “I know I’ve been quieter lately because I've been trying to handle my studies better, and it’s been a bit overwhelming.”

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful way to express your feelings! It shows that you’re working on the challenges while also inviting her to understand more about what you’re going through. 

User: Thanks! I feel like I have a clearer idea of how to approach it now.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel more prepared! As we wrap up, how do you feel about keeping track of these conversations with your mom? It could be a way to notice patterns and progress.

User: That sounds helpful! I could write down when I talk with her and how it goes.

Consultant: Great idea! Keeping a journal can help you reflect and refine your communication strategies. Let's plan to discuss your next interactions next time. How do you feel about that plan?

User: That sounds good to me! I’m feeling more optimistic about things.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that, Li Ming. Remember, it's all about taking small steps towards improving your connection with your mom. You are doing great work here. 

User: Thank you for your support! I’ll try to put these ideas into practice.

Consultant: Of course! I believe in your ability to strengthen that relationship. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you for this session. How are you feeling today regarding your self-understanding and relationships since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I've had some insights from the mental health seminar at school, and it's helped me understand myself and my relationships better.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It's great to hear that you've gained some valuable insights. Can you share a little more about what you learned and how it has impacted your relationships?

User: Sure! I learned about the importance of self-identity and how it affects my interactions with others. I feel like I'm more aware of my needs and can express them better, which has improved my communication with my mom and friends.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more aware and able to express your needs. How has this newfound awareness changed your interactions with your mom and friends?

User: I think I've become more assertive, and I'm not as afraid to discuss my feelings. It's led to more open conversations with my mom, and I feel like our relationship is stronger now.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Building that openness can really strengthen your relationships. What specific changes have you noticed in those conversations with your mom?

User: I've noticed that we can talk about things that used to make me anxious, like school stress. Instead of just bottling it up, I share it with her, and she seems more understanding now.

Consultant: That's a significant step! Opening up about school stress can really lighten the emotional load. Have you found any particular strategies that help you when discussing your feelings with her?

User: I’ve started by stating what I feel first before jumping into details about what's bothering me. It helps set a more positive tone for the conversation.

Consultant: That's a great approach—starting with your feelings can create a more supportive environment. Do you feel that your understanding of your own feelings has also improved your friendships?

User: Yes! I feel I can connect with my friends on a deeper level. If someone seems upset, I’m more inclined to ask them about it and actually listen.

Consultant: That’s so important! Being able to listen and connect deeply can truly enhance your friendships. Have there been any challenges in your relationships since making these changes?

User: A few times, I think I over-explain my feelings, and it seems to confuse my friends. I'm still trying to find that balance in sharing without overwhelming them.

Consultant: Finding the right balance can be tricky. It's completely normal to navigate that. How do your friends usually respond when you share your feelings, even if you feel it might be overwhelming?

User: They usually appreciate my honesty, but I can tell sometimes they're not sure how to respond. I don’t want to make them feel awkward.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about that. Perhaps you could ask your friends how they feel about the way you share your thoughts. It could open up a conversation about what feels comfortable for both of you.

User: That's a great idea! I think I would feel more reassured knowing their perspective on our conversations.

Consultant: Exactly! Communication is a two-way street. As you reflect on your progress, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway from this experience about yourself?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that being open about my feelings doesn't just help me; it also helps others feel safe to share too. It’s a mutual growth process.

Consultant: That's a profound realization, Li Ming. Mutual growth in relationships is so valuable. As we think about moving forward, what specific growth goals would you like to aim for in your relationships or self-development?

User: I want to continue improving my communication skills, maybe even explore ways to help my friends open up more when they're struggling.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! Helping others while developing your communication is a win-win situation. How do you envision starting this journey?

User: I could check in with my friends more often, maybe create a space where we can share our thoughts without judgment. 

Consultant: Creating a judgment-free space is an excellent idea! Would you like to brainstorm ways to initiate these check-ins or how to create that safe space?

User: Yes! I think I could start a small group chat where we can share little updates or feelings. That feels less intimidating than one-on-one conversations at first.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! A group chat can provide an easy platform for everyone to share and feel connected. How do you think you'll encourage others to participate actively in that space?

User: I think I’ll lead by example, sharing my thoughts first. I believe that could encourage them to open up.

Consultant: Leading by example is a powerful way to initiate dialogue. I’m excited to hear how this develops for you! As we wrap up today, what have you noticed about your progress overall?

User: I feel like I've grown a lot in understanding myself and expressing my feelings, which makes me more confident. I really appreciate this journey.

Consultant: You’ve made incredible progress, Li Ming, and it’s been a pleasure to support you through this process. As you continue to build these skills, remember that it’s okay to seek support when needed. If challenges arise or you need guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped now, and I’ll definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Today’s session has been very impactful. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you work towards your goals. 

User: Thank you! I feel hopeful about the future.
