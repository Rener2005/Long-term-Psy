Consultant: Hello Rosie! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I'm really overwhelmed. With finding out I'm pregnant again, I feel so much anxiety about how I will manage everything, especially financially and with the kids. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure right now, especially with your recent pregnancy and caring for your children. Can you share more about what specific worries you have regarding your financial and parenting situation?

User: I worry that I won't be able to provide for my kids. My income is unstable, and sometimes I feel like a failure as a mother. My little ones are already struggling with going to school, and I'm just scared things will get worse.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially in such a challenging situation. What do you think has been the hardest part for you in managing both your work and your children's needs?

User: I think balancing everything is tough. When the kids don’t want to go to school, it stresses me out even more, and that adds to my anxiety. I feel like I’m constantly in survival mode.

Consultant: Yes, it's a lot for anyone to handle, especially trying to support your children's schooling while managing your own stress. What would you say is the thought that comes to your mind most often during those stressful moments?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough and that my kids deserve better than what I can give them. It’s like a loop in my mind telling me I’m failing.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy, Rosie. Can we take a moment to explore that thought of "not being good enough"? What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: Well, I guess I keep trying my best for them. I take care of them every day, and I love them. But then I think about my situation and everything I can't provide. 

Consultant: It seems like you really care and are doing your best for your kids, which is an important aspect. How do you feel when you remind yourself of your efforts and love for them?

User: It does make me feel a little better, but it quickly gets overshadowed by the other thoughts. I can’t help but feel stuck in this rut.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Challenging those negative thoughts can be tough. Could we try to think of alternative ways to view your situation? If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give her?

User: I would probably say that she’s doing the best she can and that she’s not alone. But when it’s me, I feel like that doesn't apply. 

Consultant: That's an interesting insight, Rosie. Many people are often much kinder to others than they are to themselves. Remembering to treat your own situation with the same compassion is important. What small steps do you think you could take to be kinder to yourself during this time?

User: Maybe I could try to focus on the positives and not dwell so much on what I can’t do. 

Consultant: That's a great start! Focusing on the positives can build resilience. Are there specific actions or activities that you’ve found helpful in reducing your anxiety in the past?

User: Sometimes getting outside for a bit with the kids helps, or even just talking to a friend. I think I should do more of that.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Rosie! Spending time outdoors and connecting with supportive friends can definitely help improve your mood and reduce anxiety. How about we explore some resources or groups that could help you access more support?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I think it would help to connect with others who understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: Absolutely, connecting with others can provide a sense of community and understanding. Have you looked into local parenting support groups or resources yet?

User: I haven’t really had the time to research. But I think joining something like that could really help me.

Consultant: It could be a positive step forward. Would you like me to help you find some local resources or groups where you can find that support?

User: Yes, I would really appreciate that. 

Consultant: Great! We can look up some options together. Also, remember to share your feelings with your friend or loved ones as you go along; support is crucial. What do you think would be a reasonable first step for you to take in finding this support?

User: I think I can set aside some time this week to look for local groups and maybe reach out to a friend to talk about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable. Setting aside time to seek support and connecting with others can make a significant difference. How are you feeling about taking that step?

User: A bit relieved actually. I feel like maybe I’m starting to regain control somehow.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Taking those initial steps can really empower you. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we talked about. What do you feel your biggest takeaway is from our session?

User: I think I realized how important it is to be kinder to myself and to actively seek out help and support, rather than just trying to manage everything alone.

Consultant: That’s a very valuable insight, Rosie! Remember, it's okay to lean on others, and recognizing your own efforts is vital. As you go forward, what strategies do you think you’ll use to foster that kindness toward yourself?

User: I’ll focus on my positive actions and plan to engage with the support around me more. It helps to talk about it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Always remember that you’re not alone in this journey. Keep in touch with those resources, and don’t hesitate to connect with me again if you need to. I'll be here for you! 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate everything.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Rosie! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello Rosie! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately, especially given the recent challenges with your children's schooling?

User: Hi. I've been really stressed out. My kids are having a hard time with school, and I feel like I'm running out of options. It's overwhelming to think about how to get them the support they need, especially with the baby on the way.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, and the pressure is building. Let’s talk about what’s been challenging specifically regarding your children's education. Can you share more about that?

User: Yeah, two of my kids just refuse to go to school. I don't know if it's because they're scared or what. I've tried talking to them, but it just feels like we're stuck. 

Consultant: That must be really frustrating for you. When they refuse to go, what thoughts come to your mind? How does that affect your day-to-day life?

User: I think I'm failing as a parent. I worry that if they fall behind, it will be harder for them later. It just feels like no matter what I do, I'm not making progress.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially since you care so much about their education. Would you say that these feelings contribute to your overall stress right now?

User: Definitely. And with everything else going on, like the financial problems, it makes it even worse. I really want to find a way to help them, but I feel so stuck.

Consultant: The pressure from financial issues can compound everything else. Let's focus on how we can use the support resources available to you effectively. What resources do you currently have, or have you tried reaching out to for help?

User: I know about some local programs that assist with school issues, but I haven't reached out yet. I just don’t know how to find the time or energy to do it.

Consultant: It can be hard to take those steps when you're feeling overwhelmed. How about we look at creating a specific plan together? What if we broke down the actions you need to take into smaller, more manageable steps?

User: That sounds helpful! I think if I had a clear plan, I could approach it one step at a time.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by identifying the first step. What do you think would be a simple action you could take to begin reaching out for support regarding your children's education?

User: Maybe I could call one of those local programs and just ask a few questions? It doesn't sound too hard.

Consultant: That’s an excellent first step! Do you have a specific program in mind that you’d want to reach out to, or would you like help finding one?

User: I've heard about a community center that offers tutoring and educational support. I think I’ll call them.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid idea. How do you feel about setting a time this week to make that call? 

User: I can try to do it tomorrow when the kids are napping. I think that would be a good time.

Consultant: Perfect! Having a scheduled time can help create a sense of accountability. How do you feel about the prospect of making that call now?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. I think it could lead to something positive for the kids.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude to have, Rosie! Nervousness is normal, but remember this can be a step toward finding the support they need. After you make the call, how do you think that will impact your feelings about their education?

User: I think it will help me feel like I'm doing something proactive, which might ease some of this tension I feel. Just the idea of having support feels good.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that proactive step can really shift your perspective. As you work through this process, I encourage you to keep track of your feelings and thoughts. It can be helpful to see how your perceptions change as you seek support.

User: That makes sense. I can keep a little journal and write down what I'm feeling before and after the call.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! It will help you reflect on your progress and feelings. As you continue to find resources and implement support for your family, what else do you think you might need to feel more empowered in this situation?

User: I think I also want to find ways to help my kids feel comfortable going to school. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal to have! Let’s brainstorm some strategies for building their confidence about school as well. What have you observed that might be contributing to their reluctance to go?

User: They seem anxious about meeting new people and being in a big classroom. 

Consultant: Acknowledging their anxiety is a key step. Would engaging them in smaller social interactions outside of school be something you might consider?

User: Yeah, small playdates might help. They’re better when it’s one-on-one.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Facilitating those smaller connections can help them gradually build their comfort level. How might you organize a playdate in the near future?

User: I can reach out to a neighbor with kids and see if they want to come over. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It sounds like you’re already taking strides to create a supportive environment for your kids. By trying these approaches, how do you envision your family dynamics changing?

User: I hope it’ll be less tense and that we can communicate better. If they see me trying, maybe they’ll want to try as well.

Consultant: Absolutely, demonstrating your commitment could inspire them! As we wrap up today’s session, what feelings do you have about the plans we’ve discussed for addressing both support and your children's schooling?

User: I feel more hopeful and a bit lighter. Just having a plan makes things seem less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Rosie! You’ve made some wonderful commitments today. As you start implementing these steps, remember that this is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Would you like to summarize the key points we discussed before we close?

User: Sure! I’ll call the community center tomorrow, try to set up a playdate, and keep a journal of my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Remember, each step you take is an accomplishment. If you need anything before our next meeting, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Rosie. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I’m really glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to put some of the plans we discussed into practice, but it's still really overwhelming. With the kids and now being pregnant, I just feel a lot of pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing quite a challenge right now, managing the kids, your pregnancy, and everything else on your plate. What specific situations have been feeling the most overwhelming for you recently?

User: Well, my girls are very young and sometimes they refuse to go to school. That adds to my stress, especially since I don’t want to let down the school or the social services.

Consultant: That does sound stressful, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you share more about how you feel when your girls refuse to go to school? What thoughts come to mind in those moments?

User: I often think I'm failing as a mother. I worry that I won't be able to provide them with a stable environment, which is what they need to succeed.

Consultant: Feeling like you might be failing can really weigh heavily on your mind. It's important to recognize those feelings, but I wonder if there might be other perspectives we can consider. What if we explored some of those thoughts to see if they hold up against your experiences?

User: I guess I worry that if they miss too much school, it will affect their future. But maybe I could focus more on what they do learn when they are home.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Rosie! Focusing on the quality of time spent together and the learning that can happen at home is a valuable perspective. What specific activities or learning experiences have you enjoyed with them at home recently?

User: We’ve been doing some arts and crafts, which they love. We also read together sometimes, but I often feel guilty if we skip school for it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re creating some lovely learning moments through arts and crafts and reading! The guilt is understandable, but it’s also great that you’re engaging with them in such positive ways. How about thinking of these experiences as additional ways to support their learning, rather than replacing school?

User: I hadn’t thought of it like that. I see them enjoying our time together, and they seem to learn things from it. Maybe I should focus less on the guilt.

Consultant: Absolutely, shifting your focus from guilt to appreciating the time spent together can significantly change your perspective. What strategies can we put in place to balance their schooling with your engaging activities at home?

User: I could perhaps set a schedule that allows for structured play and learning. Maybe that way, we can use days when they don't want to go to school to still have productive learning.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive plan! A balanced schedule could help you feel more in control while offering them a supportive learning environment. How confident do you feel about implementing this schedule?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it. What if they still refuse school or don’t engage with the learning at home like I hope?

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous, especially with the unpredictability of young children. It might help to have some flexibility built into your schedule. What could you do if they resist the plan? 

User: I could try to understand what they want to do instead, or maybe incorporate some of their interests into the learning schedule.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Being open to their interests can foster a positive learning environment. What interests or activities do your kids particularly enjoy that we could integrate?

User: They love playing with dolls and pretend play. If I could tie in some storytelling with their dolls, that might keep them engaged.

Consultant: That sounds like a delightful way to blend their interests with learning! Storytelling can enhance creativity and cognition. Let’s reflect on how you can create those storytelling sessions. How frequently do you think you could offer that as an option?

User: I might be able to do it a few times a week, especially if I connect it with lessons from school. 

Consultant: That sounds very feasible! By connecting it back to school lessons, you’re reinforcing their learning. What's one small step you can take this week to initiate that storytelling session?

User: I could prepare a little story with their dolls for tomorrow. I think they'd really enjoy that.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging them with a story using their toys can be a fun way to interact and learn together. How are you feeling about trying this new approach?

User: I'm feeling a bit more excited now! It should be fun, and I really hope it works.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about experimenting and seeing what works best for you and the kids. As we work forward, how can we maintain this positivity and adaptability in your approach?

User: I guess I need to remind myself to stay flexible and not get too upset if things don’t go exactly as planned.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! Flexibility is key, and it helps reduce pressure on both you and the kids. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed? 

User: I feel like I have some practical ideas to try now, plus a little more confidence. It feels good to focus on what I can do rather than just worrying.

Consultant: That’s amazing progress, Rosie! I believe in your ability to implement these strategies. Next time, we can evaluate how they’ve worked for you and explore any new challenges or successes. You’re doing great work here, and I'm excited for you.

User: Thank you! It feels good to have a plan and know that I can reach out if I need to talk more.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can always come back whenever you need support. Until then, take care and enjoy your time with the kids!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I'm glad you're back for another session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay. I've started to feel more comfortable with the community support programs. It's nice to have people to talk to about parenting.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re building some positive relationships. Can you share what specific ideas or strategies from the community programs you've found helpful so far?

User: Well, I learned a few techniques for encouraging my kids to go to school without too much fuss. It’s been hard, especially with my younger girls sometimes resisting.

Consultant: It’s understandable that getting your kids to school can be challenging. What strategies have you tried that seem to help, even a little?

User: I’ve tried offering them a small reward for going to school, like extra playtime afterward. It sometimes works, but not always. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good tactic! Rewards can be motivating for kids. What feelings arise when your efforts don’t lead to the desired outcome?

User: I feel a bit defeated and worried that I’m not doing enough for them. It’s hard not to compare myself to other parents I see.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially when you care so much. Can you think of any specific negative thoughts that arise when you compare yourself to other parents?

User: I often think I should be able to manage better since they seem to have everything under control. I feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Rosie. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you are failing as a parent? 

User: I don’t know… maybe I just see my kids struggling and wish I could do more for them.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It might help to remember that parenting is challenging for everyone, and not every parent has it easy, even if it looks that way. Would it be helpful to look for positive moments or successes you’ve had in your parenting?

User: Yes, I do have some good moments, like when I manage to get them to help with chores or when they seem happy and engaged at home.

Consultant: Those are important achievements! Recognizing those moments can help build your confidence. What if we try to focus on one specific strategy you can consistently use to encourage your kids and celebrate those successes together?

User: That could work. Maybe if I can keep track of their progress, it will help me feel more positive about it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a simple chart or journal could help you visualize their achievements and your efforts. How would you feel about implementing that?

User: I think it could really help. I could track their school attendance and anything else I encourage them to do.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Additionally, how about setting small, achievable goals for the week that you can celebrate together? 

User: I’d love that! It might make them feel proud of their progress too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating little victories can foster a sense of accomplishment for both you and your children. What would be the first goal you’d want to set for this week?

User: I’d like to focus on getting my boys to school on time every day. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! What kind of reward would you consider for them if they achieve it?

User: Maybe I could let them choose a fun family activity for the weekend if they do it all week.

Consultant: That sounds like an enjoyable reward that could really motivate them! How do you feel about this new approach you're planning on taking?

User: I feel optimistic! It seems manageable, and I think they’d be excited about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also make sure you’re feeling good about your own progress. How would you like to manage any feelings of doubt when they come up this week?

User: I guess I can remind myself of the positive moments and stay focused on the goals rather than comparing myself to others.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Keeping a positive perspective will be important. We can also go over any challenges you face next time we meet. How does that sound?

User: Yes! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Wonderful, Rosie! It sounds like you're on a good path. Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs, and I’m here to support you. In our next session, we'll take time to reflect on your progress and any new strategies you've tried. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support.

Consultant: Of course! You’re doing important work, and I believe in your ability to navigate this journey. Take care until we meet again!

User: Bye! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Rosie! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit more stable, actually. I’m starting to feel hopeful about the future, especially with some support from the community programs. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the community support has made a positive impact on your emotions. Can you tell me more about the emotional management course you attended? 

User: Yes! The course was really helpful. It taught me techniques to manage my emotions better, and I feel like I can handle my responsibilities as a mom a bit more effectively now.

Consultant: I'm glad you found it helpful! It's important to feel equipped to manage those emotions. How have you been applying what you learned in your daily life? 

User: I’ve been trying to take a step back when I feel overwhelmed. Instead of reacting impulsively, I pause and breathe, which helps me think more clearly. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Rosie! Taking a pause can really help in those intense moments. Can you think of a recent situation where you used this technique?

User: Just yesterday, my youngest kids were acting up and I was about to lose my temper. I remembered to breathe and count to ten before responding. It really helped me stay calm and address their needs rather than just reacting. 

Consultant: That’s excellent progress! It sounds like you’re learning to manage those stressful situations better. How did your kids respond to your calm approach? 

User: They seemed to respond better, actually. I explained why they needed to listen instead of just yelling at them. It felt more effective, and I think it helped them understand. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’ve taken a positive step in your parenting by using your new skills. It seems like you're happy with that approach. How did that make you feel? 

User: I felt proud of myself. It was nice to see that my actions could positively affect my children. I wasn't sure if I could change things, but I feel hopeful.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re starting to see the fruits of your efforts. Feeling proud is so important in this journey. Let’s build on that. Are there any situations in your daily life that still feel challenging to you? 

User: Sometimes I struggle when the kids refuse to go to school. It’s frustrating, and I don’t know how to motivate them without forcing them. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can be tough to encourage kids to go to school when they resist. What thoughts do you have when they refuse? 

User: I often think that I'm failing as a parent. It makes me feel helpless, and I worry about their future.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, but remember that you're doing your best. Sometimes our thoughts can be extreme. Can we explore how realistic those thoughts are? 

User: I guess I feel that way because I want them to have the best opportunities, and I fear they won’t if they don’t go to school.

Consultant: Those concerns show how much you care about their future. What evidence do you have that skipping school would lead to negative outcomes? 

User: I don't really have clear evidence. It’s mostly my fears talking. I just want them to succeed.

Consultant: Recognizing that is a big step, Rosie. Let’s reframe that thought. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that kids go through phases and that it doesn’t mean they won't succeed in life. 

Consultant: Exactly! They are in a phase, and your support is crucial, even if it doesn’t feel perfect. What would it look like to approach the situation with that mindset? 

User: Maybe I could talk to them about their feelings about school instead of pushing them. That way, I could understand their perspective.

Consultant: That’s a terrific idea! Opening up a dialogue can help them feel supported rather than pressured. How do you feel about trying that approach? 

User: I feel relieved! It seems like a less intense way to handle it. I just want them to feel safe expressing themselves.

Consultant: You’re creating a nurturing environment, and that’s so important. Remember that it’s okay to adjust your approach as needed. How do you feel about implementing this new strategy this week? 

User: I’m excited to try it. I think it will help both me and the kids feel better about going to school.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Let’s check in next time about how it went. Also, in terms of your overall emotional management, do you feel like you have techniques you can rely on when stress arises? 

User: Yes, I do now! I’ve learned a lot about breathing and taking breaks. I also talk to friends or family when I need to vent.

Consultant: Those are powerful tools to have. It’s wonderful to hear you’ve built such a supportive network. How might you ensure that these techniques remain a part of your routine moving forward? 

User: I think I need to set reminders for myself to use these techniques regularly. Maybe even write down my feelings like I did in the course.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Writing can be a great way to process your feelings. As we wrap up today, what is your biggest takeaway from our session? 

User: I feel more empowered. I realize I can approach situations differently and that my emotions don’t define my abilities as a parent.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Rosie! It showcases your growth. Remember that you have the skills to manage both your feelings and those challenging parenting moments. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate our conversations. I feel more hopeful about the future. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made remarkable progress. I look forward to hearing more about your experiences next time. Take care, Rosie! 

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like things have improved a bit. I've been trying to stay positive and focus on my kids' education. But I'm still uncertain about how to keep this momentum going, especially with everything changing again since I found out I'm pregnant.

Consultant: That's understandable. You’ve taken some positive steps regarding your children's education, and it’s normal to feel uncertain with another pregnancy. Can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed has improved in your family environment?

User: Well, for starters, my children seem a bit happier and more engaged. We’ve been spending more time reading together and talking about school. I feel like I’m more present for them.

Consultant: It sounds like you've created a more nurturing environment, which is wonderful to hear! How does it feel to be more involved in their education?

User: It feels good, actually. I feel like I’m doing something right for them. But then I worry about how I can keep up this involvement while also managing everything else, especially now with the new baby coming.

Consultant: It’s great that you feel positive about your involvement. Balancing everything can certainly be challenging. What are some specific concerns you have about managing your time and energy?

User: I'm worried that I won't have enough time for my older kids once the baby arrives, or that I'll feel overwhelmed with everything. My two youngest can be a handful, too.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed, especially with four kids and a new baby on the way. Have you thought about any strategies that could help you manage your time and energy as you navigate these changes?

User: I've tried to think of ways to organize our days better, maybe create a schedule. But I'm not sure how realistic that is with my current situation.

Consultant: A schedule can be a helpful tool to manage your time. Let’s explore this idea a bit more. What activities or routines do you think are most important to include in your schedule?

User: I think it's important to have time for homework and play for the older boys, and also some personal time for my younger girls, plus time to rest myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach. Including personal time is essential for your well-being, too. What could be a starting point for creating this schedule, perhaps beginning with just a few key activities?

User: Maybe I could set specific times for homework and reading, and then plan some playtime afterward. That way, the boys can focus, and then we can have fun together too.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Structuring a routine with dedicated time for both responsibilities and fun can help everyone feel more settled. How do you feel about starting with this routine?

User: I feel hopeful about it. I think it would give us all something to look forward to and help me feel more in control. 

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective! In addition to a schedule, how do you think community support could play a role in helping you manage your responsibilities?

User: I think it would be really helpful if I could connect with other parents, maybe even find someone to help with the kids once in a while. I could use that break.

Consultant: Connecting with others can provide valuable support. Do you have any specific support groups in mind, or would you need help finding them?

User: I haven’t really looked into it yet, but I think a support group for single parents could be beneficial. I’ll need to research it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Community can be a great source of strength. How do you feel about taking this next step to seek out support?

User: I feel encouraged. I realize I don’t have to do this alone, and that feels really nice. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, seeking support is a strength. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to summarize what you’ve identified as your next steps.

User: Right! I will work on creating a schedule that includes time for homework and play, and I’ll look into finding a support group for single parents. 

Consultant: Those are excellent steps, Rosie! You’re making a lot of progress. How do you feel about the strategies we’ve discussed during our session today?

User: I feel optimistic. I think I can manage this better than I thought, and having a plan really helps.
