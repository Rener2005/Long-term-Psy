Consultant: Hello Li Yu, I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really lost. My classes have started, but I find myself dozing off during lectures again. It makes me worried about my grades and my ability to keep up.

Consultant: It sounds really tough for you. Feeling confused about your sleep in class and worrying about your academic performance can be quite heavy. Can you tell me a bit more about what goes through your mind when you're dozing off? 

User: I just feel so overwhelmed. Sometimes I think, “What’s the point? I can’t even stay awake.” It just makes me feel worse about myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with the pressure of your classes. When you think, “What’s the point?” it seems to add more weight to your situation. How does that thought affect your emotions and motivation?

User: It makes me feel really useless. I already don’t have great grades, and when I sleep in class, I feel like I’m just confirming that I’ll never do well.

Consultant: That must feel really discouraging. It seems like there’s a cycle where your thoughts about your performance lead to feelings of worthlessness, which then affects your focus in class. Let's explore those thoughts. When you think about your performance, are there any specific beliefs that stand out to you?

User: I guess I often think that I'm just not smart enough. I've struggled so much before, especially when I failed my exams and had to redo my year. It still haunts me.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has created a deeply rooted belief about yourself—that you’re not smart enough. That belief likely influences how you view your current academic challenges. How might you respond to a friend who was feeling this way about themselves?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone struggles at times and that it doesn't define who they are. But I don’t apply that same kindness to myself.

Consultant: That's a very empathetic perspective to offer to a friend. It’s important to remember that we can often be our own harshest critics. What if we tried to reframe that belief? Instead of “I'm not smart enough,” can we think of another way to view your academic journey?

User: Maybe I could say, “I am learning, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” 

Consultant: That’s a great alternative! Saying “I am learning” shifts your perspective from a fixed mindset to one that acknowledges growth. How do you feel saying that to yourself might change how you approach your studies?

User: I think it might make me feel less pressured. If I see it as a learning process rather than just failing or succeeding, it seems less daunting.

Consultant: Exactly, it reduces that immediate pressure to perform perfectly. Now, let’s talk about some strategies that can help with your focus during class. Have you tried any techniques to stay awake or engaged in lectures?

User: Not really. I just usually try to fight it, but that doesn’t really work. 

Consultant: Understandable. Sometimes fighting against sleepiness can make it worse. What if we brainstormed some proactive strategies, like small breaks during class or even engaging in note-taking techniques? How does that sound?

User: That sounds reasonable. I guess I could try to take notes more actively, maybe it would keep me awake better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Active note-taking can help you engage more with the material. Also, have you thought about what you could do on days when you feel particularly tired? Any habits that might support better alertness?

User: I guess I could try to get more sleep at night. I often stay up late playing games.

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Improving your sleep hygiene can make a significant difference in your alertness during class. How about we set a small goal for adjusting your sleep schedule this week?

User: Sure, maybe I can try going to bed an hour earlier. 

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable plan. Let’s also think about how you can reward yourself for sticking to that goal—what would help motivate you?

User: Hmm, maybe I could play games for a bit longer on the weekends if I manage to sleep earlier?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic incentive! Balancing your activities can help keep you motivated. As we conclude today’s session, what do you feel are the most important takeaways from our conversation?

User: I think reframing my thoughts is really helpful, and trying to get more sleep could improve my focus in class.

Consultant: Those are very important insights! You’re already on the path to seeing things in a different light. Remember, it’s okay to seek support and take things one step at a time. If you find yourself struggling, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate all your help today. I’ll try these strategies.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li Yu! I’m here whenever you need support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how you're doing next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li Yu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really low. After the conversation with my counselor about my grades, I can't help but doubt my academic abilities even more.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like that conversation really affected your self-esteem and made you question your capabilities. Can you tell me more about what you felt during and after that discussion?

User: I felt embarrassed and ashamed. It’s like I’m stuck in a cycle where I just can't seem to do well in my studies, and every time I think about it, I just feel worse about myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when external pressures build up. Can we explore some of the specific thoughts you have when you consider your academic performance? What ideas come to mind?

User: I keep thinking that I am just not smart enough for university. I also feel like my past failures define me, like when I didn’t make it into college the first time.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging. Let’s take a closer look at them. You mentioned feeling that past failures define your present. What kind of evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: Well, my grades aren't great. And I just can't shake the feeling that I was stupid for failing last year.

Consultant: I can see how those past experiences weigh heavily on you. However, it might be helpful to look at your current situation more objectively. Have you considered any evidence that might contradict that view of yourself as "not smart enough"?

User: I guess I worked hard to get into university after my resit. But it just feels like my effort is not enough...

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Li Yu. It shows your persistence and ability to overcome challenges. Let's try to reframe your current situation—what if we focus on your efforts instead of just the outcomes? How might that change your perspective?

User: It might help to think that I’m trying hard, but still struggling. I feel like I should be better, though.

Consultant: It's completely valid to feel that pressure. We can aim for small, realistic goals instead. What if we identified specific steps you could take that would allow you to feel a sense of progress in your studies?

User: Maybe I could set aside certain times each week to study specific subjects? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Setting a study schedule can help create structure and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. What subjects do you think you want to focus on first?

User: I suppose I should start with the subjects I find challenging, like math and science.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Let's break it down further. How about setting a specific time each week for those subjects? 

User: I think I could manage two hours on Sundays for math and one hour after my classes on Tuesdays for science.

Consultant: That’s a positive plan! Consistency will help reinforce those study habits. As you start this routine, what do you think will help you remain motivated?

User: I think rewarding myself with a small treat afterward might keep me motivated. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Small rewards can reinforce positive behavior and make studying feel more rewarding. How do you feel about sharing your goals with someone, perhaps your brother or a friend?

User: I'm not sure. I don’t want them to think badly of me if I don’t meet those goals.

Consultant: It's natural to fear judgment, but sharing your goals can offer support and accountability. Perhaps you can frame it as seeking encouragement rather than scrutiny. How might you feel about that?

User: I guess I could try that. It wouldn’t hurt to have someone else to talk to about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! A support system can be really valuable. Let's shift gears—how do you feel about engaging more in class discussions? 

User: I feel anxious even thinking about it. I often just want to avoid talking in front of others.

Consultant: It is normal to feel anxious about speaking up in class. Let's consider setting a small goal there too. Perhaps you could aim to speak up once in your next class. How does that sound?

User: It sounds scary! But I think I could try to ask a question even if it’s just once.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Li Yu! Remember, every little effort counts, and I believe you can do it. How might you prepare for that moment before you speak up?

User: I could write down what I want to say in advance. That might make me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Having your thoughts organized can definitely ease your anxiety. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on your progress. What do you feel you've gained from our session?

User: I feel like I have a clearer plan now. I at least know that I can take small steps toward improving how I feel about my studies and maybe even my participation in class.

Consultant: That's a significant recognition, Li Yu! Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and it's all about taking those manageable steps. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Li Yu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit discouraged. I'm really struggling with participating in classroom discussions. It seems like I can’t express myself well, and I'm worried about how others perceive me.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Li Yu. It sounds like your feelings of self-doubt are affecting your ability to participate. Can you share a specific instance from a recent discussion that made you feel this way?

User: Well, during a group project last week, I wanted to share my ideas, but I just froze. I felt like my thoughts were getting stuck, and I was afraid of saying something stupid. So, I ended up not speaking at all.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Li Yu. It sounds like that was a frustrating experience for you. Can you recall what thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "What if they laugh at me?" and "I'm not as smart as they are." Those thoughts just made me feel more anxious.

Consultant: It seems like those negative thoughts really contributed to your anxiety. Let’s explore them a bit further. How realistic do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts those fears?

User: I guess I don’t have any real evidence that they'd laugh at me. Maybe it's just how I feel. But still, it feels very real when I'm there.

Consultant: It’s common for such thoughts to feel very real, even if they’re not based on facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to just share what they think, even if it’s not perfect.

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate perspective! Now, let’s try to apply that same understanding to yourself. What if you approached classroom discussions with a mindset similar to what you’d tell a friend?

User: I think I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that not every thought needs to be perfect before I share it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy. Let’s practice by role-playing a classroom discussion. I can be one of your classmates asking for your input, and you can respond as if we're in that setting. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds helpful. I can give it a try.

Consultant: Fantastic! So, imagine we're in a discussion about a recent book we read. I’ll ask you to share your thoughts: "Li Yu, what did you think about the main character's decision in the story?"

User: (pauses) I think... um, I believe the character was making a choice based on fear, but it also showed... how we sometimes don’t see all options.

Consultant: Excellent! You shared your thoughts, which is a great step. How did that feel for you?

User: It was a bit nerve-wracking, but I think it was okay.

Consultant: That’s important to recognize. It can feel uncomfortable at first, but with practice, it will become easier. What can you do to prepare yourself before such discussions in the future?

User: Maybe I could write down some points I’d like to share ahead of time, so I have a reference.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Preparing in advance can help ease your nerves. How about we set a small goal for your next class? What would you like to aim for?

User: I want to try to speak at least once in the next discussion, even if it’s just a small comment.

Consultant: That’s a realistic and achievable goal, Li Yu. I believe you can do it! After you try this, we can discuss how it went next time. How do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. It gives me something to work towards.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, but it's great to hear that you feel hopeful. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let's also think about what you’ll do if you start feeling anxious during the discussion.

User: I guess I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it's okay to speak, even if I mess up.

Consultant: Yes, deep breathing can help ground you. And remember, it’s okay to make mistakes. So, if you do feel anxious, using those reminders can really support you. How are you feeling about what we’ve worked on today?

User: I feel like I have some tools to help me, and that gives me hope. I liked the role-playing part too; it made it feel less scary.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li Yu! It’s been valuable to explore these strategies together. In our next session, we can review your experience in the classroom and continue building on these skills. Remember, every small step counts. 

User: Thanks, I really appreciate the support. I’ll try my best to speak up.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li Yu. I believe in you and your ability to grow. Let’s touch base next time and see how things went. Take care until then!

User: Will do! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Yu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat down, especially after that campus event. I tried to make new friends, but I couldn't manage it. It makes me feel like I’m just not good at socializing.

Consultant: I can sense the disappointment you’re feeling. It’s tough when things don’t go as we hope. Let's explore that experience a bit more. What specific thoughts were running through your mind during the event?

User: I kept thinking that everyone around me was more confident and that I would embarrass myself if I tried to talk to anyone. I just froze.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like those thoughts created a lot of pressure for you. How did those feelings affect your actions at the event?

User: I ended up not talking to anyone. I just stood there awkwardly, and I felt really out of place. It’s like this fear just took over.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Sometimes our fears can hold us back. Let’s examine those thoughts a bit closer. You mentioned feeling like you would embarrass yourself. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts that thought?

User: Well, I guess I can't really be sure I would have embarrassed myself. Maybe I just assumed people would judge me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Li Yu. It seems there’s a possibility that your mind was jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage him to view the situation?

User: I’d probably tell him that it’s okay to be nervous and that most people are probably focused on themselves, not judging others. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a great reminder that others are often more engaged in their own thoughts. Now, what if we tried to reframe your original thought about embarrassing yourself? What would a more balanced thought look like?

User: Hmm… maybe I could think something like, “It’s normal to feel nervous, and my efforts to talk will help me improve over time,” instead of focusing on possible failure.

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift! Focusing on progress rather than perfection can be a helpful approach. Looking ahead, what kind of small steps can you take to practice socializing more comfortably?

User: I was thinking I could start by talking to a classmate I see often, maybe about an assignment or something casual. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Small interactions can build your confidence over time. How about setting a goal for yourself? 

User: I could aim to initiate a conversation at least once this week. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Initiating conversation, even about small things, can indeed help ease anxiety. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a little nervous but also excited. It gives me hope that I can improve.

Consultant: And that’s a positive way to look at it! Remember that it’s completely normal to feel nervous, but each small step you take will bring you closer to your goal. Are there any concerns you have about this plan?

User: I’m worried I might just freeze up again, but I’ll try to remind myself of what we talked about.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Preparing some topics or questions in advance might help ease the pressure. Would you like to brainstorm a few of these now?

User: Yes! I think asking about class topics or school events would be good starters.

Consultant: Great ideas! Having a few questions prepared can reduce the burden when you initiate a conversation. Remember to celebrate your efforts, regardless of the outcome. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think I’ll keep in mind that it’s about practice, not perfection.

Consultant: Exactly, that’s the spirit! As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your ability to take these steps moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I’m looking forward to trying this out and seeing how it goes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, you can always reach out for support even as you take these steps. I believe in your ability to manage this.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Yu! Keep building on those small victories, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care until we meet again!

User: I will, thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Yu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with the book club you joined?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good. Being part of the book club has made me a bit more optimistic about my social skills. I didn't expect to enjoy it so much!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like joining the book club has had a positive impact on you. Can you share a bit more about what you enjoyed most about the experience?

User: I liked how everyone shared their ideas and opinions. It felt nice to be part of something where I could contribute without the pressure of talking in large groups.

Consultant: It sounds like you're finding comfort in smaller, supportive environments. That's a significant step forward. What do you think you learned about yourself through this experience?

User: I realized that I can actually talk to people about things I care about when I'm in a familiar setting. It gives me a sense of control.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Li Yu. Feeling in control in social situations can really help reduce anxiety. Have you thought about how you might apply this in other social settings or activities?

User: I think if I can find more groups that focus on things I like, it might be easier to interact. But I'm still worried about speaking up when there are more people.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous in larger groups, but your experiences in the book club can serve as practice. How do you think we could help you feel more comfortable when that happens?

User: Maybe we could role-play some conversations or scenarios? I think that might help me get used to it.

Consultant: Role-playing is a great idea! It can help you prepare for real-life interactions. What specific scenarios do you feel would be most helpful for you to practice?

User: I guess just introducing myself and sharing my thoughts on a book or something. Sometimes I just freeze up.

Consultant: Practicing introductions and sharing your thoughts can boost your confidence. Would you like to start with a brief introduction for our role-play now?

User: Sure! Okay, here goes. Hi, I'm Li Yu, and I recently joined this book club because I love reading. I read a lot of fantasy novels.

Consultant: Great start, Li Yu! You introduced yourself and shared your interest, which is fantastic. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit nerve-wracking, but not as bad as I expected. I think I could get used to it with more practice.

Consultant: Exactly! The more you practice, the easier it will become. How about we try introducing yourself in a larger group now? Imagine there are five people listening.

User: Okay, let me try again. Hi everyone, I'm Li Yu. I'm excited to be here and I love reading, especially fantasy. What about you guys?

Consultant: That was excellent! You not only introduced yourself but also invited others to engage. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel more comfortable now. It seems like a good way to connect with others and keep the conversation going.

Consultant: You've done a great job. This approach promotes interaction, which is crucial in a group setting. Do you think you could apply this when meeting new people in future activities?

User: Yes, I think I can. It's all about just taking that first step, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that first step is often the hardest part. Would you like to set some new goals for yourself based on these learnings?

User: Definitely! I want to aim to introduce myself in at least one new social situation each week. That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Setting a weekly goal will give you consistent opportunities to practice. What else do you want to focus on developing?

User: I’d like to work on discussing my favorite books more fluently. I often get stuck and it doesn't come out right.

Consultant: Perfect! Focusing on discussing your interests can keep the conversation engaging. How about we create a list of your favorite books and practice describing them in a few sentences?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! I can prepare some talking points.

Consultant: Great! Preparing talking points will build your confidence. You also mentioned wanting to consolidate your progress—how could we measure your success?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal about each interaction, noting how I felt and any feedback I got from others.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea, Li Yu! Writing about your experiences can help you reflect and notice your progress. How do you feel about starting that today?

User: I feel good about it! It’ll be a nice way to track my journey.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember to celebrate the little victories along the way. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway from our session that you'll carry forward?

User: I think the role-playing and the idea of introducing myself in different situations will be really helpful moving forward.

Consultant: That's a valuable takeaway! I believe in your ability to grow. So, let’s aim for these weekly introductions and journaling. If you find yourself needing support, remember I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I feel more optimistic about things now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Li Yu! It's been wonderful to see your progress and positivity today. Remember, you’ve got this, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

Consultant: Hi Li Yu! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear about your recent improvement in your academic performance. How are you feeling today, and what would you like to focus on during our session?

User: Hi! Thank you. I'm feeling a bit more confident about my abilities, but I still have some concerns regarding my studies and social interactions. I want to make sure I keep improving.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable goal. It's important to build on your confidence and progress. Can you share more about what aspects of your studies and social interactions you'd like to further develop?

User: Well, I really want to maintain this momentum in my studies. But I also struggle a lot when it comes to speaking up in class or making friends. I guess I want to find ways to be more engaged.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to balance your academic success with social engagement. You mentioned feeling uncertain about speaking in class. What thoughts or feelings come up for you when you're in those situations?

User: When I'm in class, I often feel nervous and think that my opinions won't matter or won't be good enough. This makes me hesitate to speak up. 

Consultant: That self-doubt can be quite challenging. It seems like those thoughts may be holding you back. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your willingness to contribute in class?

User: Yes, definitely. When I think like that, I usually just stay quiet and feel even more isolated. It’s frustrating because I want to participate but my mind just stops me.

Consultant: It’s a common struggle many people face. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts. What if your opinions are valuable and worthy of sharing? How do you think your experience might change if you believed that more?

User: I suppose I'd feel more motivated to speak up. Maybe if I prepared my thoughts beforehand, it could help build my confidence.

Consultant: Preparing your thoughts is a great strategy! It can give you a sense of readiness. Would you be open to trying that in your next class? Perhaps you could jot down a few points you'd like to share?

User: Yes, I think that might help. Having something to refer to could make it less intimidating.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Additionally, it might be helpful to set small goals for participating—like aiming to contribute at least once each class. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! Just one contribution feels like a manageable step. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking small steps can lead to significant progress over time. How about we also explore ways to expand your social connections outside of class?

User: That would be great! I want to feel more comfortable making friends, but it always feels awkward to initiate conversations.

Consultant: Starting conversations can feel daunting. One approach is to start by asking open-ended questions to others. What kind of things do you think may interest your peers?

User: I guess we might share interests in gaming or school projects. But I worry they won’t want to talk to me because I’m quiet.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, but often people appreciate someone showing interest in them. You could approach someone and mention a game or a project. How would that feel to you?

User: I think I could try that. It seems less intimidating if it’s about something they like too.

Consultant: Exactly! That common ground can facilitate conversation. Would you be willing to practice this kind of initiation outside of our sessions? It might help ease your anxiety.

User: Yes, I’d like to give it a shot! Practicing could help me become more comfortable.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like you have a solid action plan for both your academic contributions and social interactions. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today, shall we?

User: Sure. We talked about preparing my thoughts for class discussions and setting a goal to contribute at least once. And for socializing, I’ll try to start conversations based on shared interests like gaming.

Consultant: That’s right! You’re setting practical steps that are achievable. As you implement these strategies, notice how you feel during these experiences. How are you feeling about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! I think these are practical things I can do, and I’m eager to try them out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey—progress may come gradually. Keep being kind to yourself as you work through this. Do you have any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think I’m all set! Thank you for your support. I appreciate our conversations.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Yu! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until our next session!
