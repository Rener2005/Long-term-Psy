Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately, especially in relation to your classes?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious during classes, especially when I think the teacher is watching me. It makes me really tense, and I can't concentrate on what’s being taught.

Consultant: It sounds like the teacher's gaze brings on a lot of anxiety for you. I want to understand that better. Can you describe what you typically feel or think when you notice the teacher looking at you?

User: When I see the teacher looking at me, I immediately think that I must be doing something wrong or that I’m not performing well enough. It makes me feel like everyone will judge me.

Consultant: That’s a significant thought. It can be tough to feel judged or under pressure. Let’s explore that thought further. What specific emotions do you experience when you feel like the teacher is judging you?

User: I feel a rush of panic, my heart races, and sometimes I even get a little shaky. It’s like I want to disappear or just not be noticed at all.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way in a stressful situation. It seems like that gaze triggers a strong fight-or-flight response in you. Have you noticed if this happens more with certain teachers, or is it consistent across all your classes?

User: Mostly, it happens with my current professor who is pretty strict. With other teachers, it’s not as intense, but I still feel some anxiety.

Consultant: I see. So, your current professor's style affects you more significantly. What do you think is the main reason for that heightened anxiety with this particular teacher?

User: I think it’s because I don’t want to let my father down. He has high expectations for me, and I feel like if I mess up in class, it reflects badly on me and my family.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. Your father’s expectations are influencing how you perceive your performance in class. Let’s consider alternative thoughts you could have when you feel that gaze. What might you tell yourself to help manage your anxiety in those moments?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has mistakes, and it’s part of learning. But it’s hard to think that way when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! Acknowledging the learning process can help ease some of that pressure. How about we develop a little exercise for you to practice when you start feeling those anxious thoughts?

User: That sounds helpful. What should I do?

Consultant: One approach might be to take a deep breath and repeat to yourself, “I can learn from mistakes.” During moments of anxiety, focusing on your breath can also help ground you. Would you be willing to practice this in your next class?

User: Yes, I’ll try that. I just hope I can remember it in the moment!

Consultant: It’s natural to forget under pressure. You might consider writing that phrase down and keeping it in your notebook as a reminder. Would that work for you?

User: Definitely! That way, I can look at it before the class starts.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! How do you feel about the idea of gradually exposing yourself to situations where the teacher's gaze is on you, starting with less intimidating scenarios?

User: I think that could work. Maybe I could participate in small group discussions first before speaking in front of the whole class.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Gradually exposing yourself to these situations can help build your confidence. How about we outline a few steps you can take to achieve this?

User: Sure! I think I can start by answering questions in smaller groups first, and then work up to speaking in front of everyone.

Consultant: Excellent! That’s a progressive approach. What steps do you feel would be necessary before you engage in speaking up in larger settings?

User: I guess I could start by preparing what I want to say in advance, so I feel more confident when it's my turn.

Consultant: Preparation is key. It will not only help you feel more secure but will also reduce the anxiety of being put on the spot. How else can you get ready for those moments?

User: I could also practice with a friend before class to build my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Practicing with a friend could make you feel more at ease. How does this plan feel to you overall?

User: It feels good! I feel less overwhelmed thinking about it like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s a gradual process, and it’s okay to take small steps. What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you as you start this process?

User: I think just the initial fear of being judged will be tough. But I need to remind myself that I'm learning.

Consultant: That’s a valuable reminder. And it’s normal to feel that way. As we continue to work on this together, you might find those feelings start to lessen. Remember to practice self-compassion. 

User: I will! Thank you for helping me see things differently today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I think you’re making great progress. As a summary, do you have any final thoughts or goals you’d like to focus on before we conclude our session?

User: I want to focus on practicing my breathing and preparing what to say, so I can face my teacher with more confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, you’ve got this. Looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.  

Consultant: You're very welcome! Have a great week, and take care.

Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to manage my anxiety during classes, but I still feel really pressured, especially with some of my instructors.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been making an effort, but there are still moments of pressure. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel this way in class?

User: Well, when I am in certain classes, especially with the stricter teachers, I feel my heart racing and sometimes I freeze. It’s like I can’t focus on what they are saying.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging for you. Your body is responding to the situation with anxiety. Could you recall a specific instance recently where you felt this pressure? What thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: Yes, during my last art class, I was working on a project, and I could sense the teacher watching me closely. I thought, "What if I mess this up?" That made me even more nervous.

Consultant: It seems like your mind was filled with critical thoughts during that class. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you think about failing. How did that thought affect your feelings and behavior in that moment?

User: I felt overwhelmed and wanted to just get out of there. I couldn't concentrate on my work, and it really affected my performance.

Consultant: I see. It’s like that thought of messing up created a cycle of anxiety and avoidance. Let's explore it further. What evidence do you have that suggests that you will mess up in front of your teacher?

User: I guess I don't have any strong evidence. I mean, I've done okay in the past, but I just worry about being judged.

Consultant: It’s good that you recognize this. Sometimes, our mind exaggerates fears. If a friend were in your situation, what do you think you would advise them?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much and that they just need to do their best.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective. Let’s try to apply that same thought to your own situation. What would it feel like to remind yourself that doing your best is enough, even if it’s not perfect?

User: It might make me feel more relaxed, I guess. But it’s hard to override my automatic thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a common struggle, Wei. One effective way to gradually diffuse that anxiety is through exposure. How about we create a plan for you to engage in some small tasks in those classes that might feel more comfortable initially? 

User: You mean like starting simple projects first before tackling more challenging ones? 

Consultant: Exactly! By beginning with simpler tasks, you can gradually build your confidence. What type of smaller project do you think you could handle in class?

User: Maybe I could try asking a question during class. That feels manageable, and it might help me engage more.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Engaging by asking questions can help you feel more involved and less pressured. Let’s set a goal for you to ask at least one question in your next art class. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I think I can do that. It feels less daunting than just sitting there quietly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Engaging in that way can also help shift your focus from fear to curiosity, which might lessen the pressure you feel. How do you think you might feel after trying that?

User: I hope I would feel proud of myself, and maybe it’ll build confidence for the next class.

Consultant: I believe so! Progress is often made through small steps, and each success will help enhance your confidence. Let's talk about coping strategies you can use if you feel anxious during the class. What are some things that help you calm down?

User: I usually try to take deep breaths. It helps a little, but I still feel nervous.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good start! Along with that, you might consider visualizing a positive outcome prior to class. Imagine yourself asking that question and being met with encouragement. Would you be willing to try that before your next class?

User: Yes, I can absolutely visualize that positive moment. It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Wei! Visualizing success can reduce anticipatory anxiety. Let’s recap what we discussed today. You’ll aim to ask a question in class and practice visualizing a positive experience. 

User: Yes, I feel more motivated now! Thank you for these suggestions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time and patience. As you apply these techniques, check in with how you’re feeling afterward. In our next session, we can talk about how it went. 

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to sharing my experience with you.

Consultant: Excellent! You're doing great, Wei. Keep practicing these strategies, and I believe you'll see improvements. Take care, and see you next time!

User: Thank you! See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wei! It's great to see you again for our session. How have you been since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply what we talked about, but I still find myself feeling quite anxious, especially when it comes to my teachers' evaluations. It’s like I can care less about my own thoughts and focus only on what they might think.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you're navigating some challenging feelings regarding the evaluations from your teachers. Let’s explore that a bit more. When you're in those moments of evaluation, what kind of thoughts are running through your mind?

User: I often think that if my ideas aren’t perfect, they will judge me harshly. It makes me worry that I'll disappoint them.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very powerful. It seems like you feel the need to meet a high standard, which can create a lot of pressure. Can you remember a specific instance when you felt this way recently?

User: Yes, in my last class, I had to share my project, and I was really nervous. I felt that everyone was judging me, especially the teacher. I stumbled over my words and could hardly get my points across. 

Consultant: It sounds like that was a tough experience for you. Can we unpack what you were thinking just before you spoke? What thoughts crossed your mind when you were getting ready to present?

User: I remember thinking that I needed to impress everyone, that if I didn’t do well, it would be a disaster. It made it hard to focus on what I wanted to say. 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to create a lot of pressure for you. What emotions did you feel in that moment, aside from anxiety?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit defeated. I was so stressed that I couldn’t even enjoy sharing my work.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel embarrassed and defeated in that situation. It seems like the fear of judgment is quite intense for you. Let’s consider that thought: “If I don’t impress them, it’s a disaster.” How truthful do you think that thought is? Are there other perspectives we could consider?

User: I guess I can see that it might not really be a complete disaster. But it still feels very real to me when I'm under that kind of pressure.

Consultant: It's valid to feel that way, especially when you're striving for perfection. However, it can be helpful to challenge that belief. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you offer them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that nobody is perfect, and that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a supportive perspective for others. What if you tried to apply that advice to yourself? 

User: I suppose I should remind myself that making mistakes is part of learning. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! How about we practice some affirmations or positive self-talk you can use next time you’re facing these evaluations? 

User: I've never really thought of doing that. It sounds helpful!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s come up with a few affirmations together. How does this sound: “I am capable and learning, and it’s okay to make mistakes”? 

User: Yes, I like that. It feels comforting to say that.

Consultant: Great! You can practice saying that before class or whenever you anticipate sharing your ideas. It might help ease some of that pressure. How else can we work on building your confidence in these moments?

User: Maybe I could prepare what I want to say in advance? That might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Preparing in advance can boost your confidence significantly. How do you feel about doing practice sessions where you can rehearse your ideas aloud?

User: I think that would be useful. It would make me feel more ready.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Regular practice can really make a difference. How about setting a goal for yourself to share at least one thought in your next class? 

User: That sounds achievable. I want to try.

Consultant: Fantastic, Wei! Let's continue to build on that progress. Remember, it’s about small steps. After this, what will you take away from our session today? 

User: I feel like I have some strategies now, like positive affirmations and preparation that can help me. 

Consultant: That’s an important takeaway! You have tools to create a more supportive inner dialogue, and recognizing your progress is key. Is there anything else you’d like to address before we finish for today?

User: I just want to make sure I remember to focus on my growth instead of just worrying about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective to hold onto. Focusing on your growth will definitely help you manage the pressure better. We can continue to build on this next time we meet. Thank you for sharing today, and I believe in you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wei. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wei! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session regarding your classroom participation?

User: Hi. I've been trying to apply some of the strategies we discussed, but I still feel quite nervous when I want to express my opinions in class, especially when the teacher is watching.

Consultant: I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel that way, especially when you are attempting to speak up in front of others. Can you tell me about a specific instance where you felt that nervousness recently?

User: Sure! Last week, during a group project presentation, I wanted to share my thoughts on our project. But my heart started racing, and I ended up staying quiet even though I had ideas I wanted to share.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment was quite challenging for you. What thoughts were running through your mind at that time? 

User: I kept thinking that if I spoke up, I might say something wrong or that others might judge me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of pressure! It sounds like you're concerned about making mistakes and being evaluated by your peers. How did those feelings affect your emotions during the presentation?

User: I felt really anxious and a bit ashamed for not speaking up. It’s frustrating because I really wanted to contribute.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated, especially when you have the desire to share your ideas. Let’s explore this together. You mentioned feeling anxious about judgment. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts that fear of making a mistake?

User: I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. Most of my classmates are supportive, and even if I make a mistake, they probably wouldn’t be mean about it.

Consultant: That’s a helpful realization! Sometimes, our worries about what others think can be exaggerated. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about overcoming these fears?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone makes them sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. It’s important to extend that same kindness to yourself. Let's try to replace those anxiety-provoking thoughts with something more supportive. How about coming up with a few positive affirmations or statements you can tell yourself before speaking up in class?

User: Maybe I could say, "It's okay to share my thoughts; I have valuable ideas," or "Everyone is learning together."

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations, Wei! Let’s practice using one of those statements in a hypothetical classroom scenario. Imagine you are preparing to speak up. How would you feel using one of those affirmations beforehand?

User: I think it might help me feel more at ease since I’d remind myself that my input matters.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Practicing with these affirmations might help you build that confidence over time. Could we also discuss some small steps you can take next time you're in class to gradually expose yourself to the experience of speaking up?

User: Yes, I think just raising my hand to share one small idea could be a good start.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! Starting small can make it feel more manageable. You could even set a specific goal for your next class, like raising your hand at least once. How would that feel for you?

User: I think that’s doable! I’d feel proud of myself for trying, even if I still feel nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small successes is important. As you practice, those feelings of nervousness may start to lessen, and your confidence will grow. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel more optimistic about it! I’m glad we’re working on this together.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling optimistic! Remember, progress takes time, and each attempt you make is a step forward. How about we check in about your experience and feelings during our next session? 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely share how it goes. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wei! It's been a pleasure working with you today. Keep practicing those affirmations and remember that you are capable. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Wei! Take care.
###################
Consultant: Hello Wei! I'm glad you're here today. In our last session, we talked about your recent experience with the project presentation and how you felt anxious yet excited. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been thinking a lot about that presentation. It was nerve-wracking, but I realized that I could actually influence my performance through my efforts. I still feel anxious sometimes, though.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you recognized your efforts influencing your performance positively! Can you share more about what you felt during and after the presentation?

User: During the presentation, I felt my heart racing and my hands were shaking, but once I started speaking, there was a moment when I felt confident and engaged. Afterward, I was proud of myself for doing it.

Consultant: That’s a significant step, Wei! Feeling that moment of confidence amidst anxiety shows your potential. What do you think helped you feel proud after the presentation?

User: I think it was seeing my classmates' reactions and receiving positive feedback from my teacher. It made me feel like my hard work paid off.

Consultant: Positive feedback can be very affirming. It sounds like this experience has helped you recognize the value of your hard work. How do you think you can build on this positive experience in future activities or presentations?

User: I want to remind myself of this feeling when I'm preparing for future presentations. Perhaps practicing more and visualizing success could help.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Visualization can serve to enhance your confidence further. How do you feel about practicing in front of a friend or a small group before the actual presentation?

User: I think that might help ease my nerves. I usually practice alone and get really anxious just thinking about it.

Consultant: Practicing in front of others can provide a safe space for feedback and support. Can you brainstorm how to ask someone to help you with this?

User: I could ask a couple of friends who are supportive. I think they'd be happy to help me.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having supportive friends can really lessen anxiety. How do you imagine you might feel after practicing with them?

User: I think I would feel more prepared and less anxious. It would be nice to get their feedback and encouragement.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling prepared can significantly reduce anxiety. Let’s focus on how you can maintain this positive mindset. What would you say to yourself in the lead-up to a presentation to boost your confidence?

User: I could tell myself that I've done well in the past and that I am capable of handling this.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Reminding yourself of your past successes can reinforce your confidence. Have you ever kept a journal to jot down these success moments?

User: No, I haven’t tried that, but it sounds like a good idea. It could help me see my progress.

Consultant: Keeping a journal can not only capture those moments but also serve as a reminder during tougher times. Would you be willing to start one to document your feelings and successes?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. It might help me reflect on my journey and acknowledge my growth.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Wei! Recognizing your growth is essential. As you reflect on your journey so far, what are some changes you've noticed in your confidence and performance?

User: I feel like I've become more open to participating and trying new things, which is a big change for me. I used to hesitate a lot.

Consultant: That’s a significant transformation! Embracing participation is a big step. What do you think has contributed to this change in you?

User: I believe it's partly due to my experiences during presentations and the support I’ve received from classmates and teachers.

Consultant: The support of those around you can make a tremendous difference. Let’s consider future situations—what methods would you like to practice to maintain this positive mindset and confidence?

User: I’d like to continue visualizing success and perhaps keep reminding myself of my past accomplishments before I step into any new situations.

Consultant: Those are strong techniques! As we look towards the future together, let's reinforce how you've learned to embrace challenges and reflect on setbacks. What’s one challenge you’d like to approach next with this newfound confidence?

User: I think participating in more group discussions could be my next challenge. I often feel shy in those situations.

Consultant: Group discussions can be daunting, but they’re a great opportunity to express yourself. What steps could you take to prepare for a group discussion?

User: I could prepare some points to share in advance and practice speaking them aloud before the discussion starts.

Consultant: Preparation can definitely help alleviate anxiety. Let’s plan your next steps—how about identifying a specific group discussion you want to join and setting a date to prepare for it?

User: I like that idea! There’s a discussion coming up next week in one of my classes. I could start preparing tomorrow.

Consultant: That’s perfect! Starting tomorrow gives you ample time to prepare. What do you hope to feel during that discussion?

User: I hope to feel confident and engaged, like I can contribute without overthinking it.

Consultant: That’s a commendable goal, Wei! Having that mindset will certainly help. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress together. What do you believe has been your biggest growth throughout this process?

User: I think my biggest growth has been learning to appreciate my efforts and recognizing my ability to perform well, despite my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a monumental insight! Embracing both your efforts and achievements sets a solid foundation for your confidence moving forward. Do you have any final thoughts or concerns before we end our session today?

User: I'm feeling really optimistic now, and I look forward to putting these ideas into practice. Thank you so much for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wei! It's been wonderful to see your growth. Remember, you can always revisit these strategies when needed. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really positive lately. After the campus showcase, I received such great feedback on my work, and it made me realize that my efforts are paying off.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear you're feeling positive about your performance. Can you tell me more about how this recognition has affected your self-esteem and your views on your capabilities?

User: Definitely! I feel a lot more confident in my abilities now. I used to doubt myself a lot, but this experience has shown me that I can do well if I put in the effort.

Consultant: It's fantastic to see you acknowledging your effort and the positive outcomes. Reflecting on your experiences, how would you describe the changes you’ve noticed within yourself throughout this process?

User: I’ve become more self-aware and I’m starting to appreciate my achievements more. I used to focus on my mistakes, but now I try to celebrate my successes, no matter how small.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in thinking! Celebrating your successes can really boost your confidence. What strategies do you think helped you make this change in perspective?

User: I think talking with friends and getting their support really helped. They always remind me of the good things I do, even when I forget them myself.

Consultant: Friends can be such a great support system. It sounds like you’re surrounding yourself with people who uplift you. As we move forward, how do you plan to maintain this positive mindset in your studies and life?

User: I want to keep reminding myself to reflect on my achievements regularly. Maybe I’ll start a journal to note down my successful moments.

Consultant: A journal sounds like an excellent idea! It will give you a chance to reflect and reinforce those positive experiences. Do you have any specific goals for how you want to perform in your studies moving forward?

User: I hope to become more proactive in my projects and not be afraid to share my work. I want to feel that same confidence I felt at the showcase in my classroom and assignments.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Stepping out of your comfort zone in classrooms can be challenging, but it also offers opportunities for growth. What steps can you take to gradually become more comfortable sharing your work?

User: I think starting with small group discussions might help. I could also volunteer to present projects or ideas more frequently, to get used to it.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps to take! Starting with smaller groups can help build your confidence. How do you feel about seeking feedback in those situations?

User: I feel a little anxious about it, but I know it could be beneficial. Getting constructive feedback could help me improve, and I can learn to take it more positively.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feedback can be a useful tool for growth. It’s normal to feel anxious about it, but remember it’s about learning. How might you remind yourself to view feedback as an opportunity rather than criticism?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone is learning, and feedback is part of the process. I can also tell myself that it isn't a reflection of my worth.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Reminding yourself of the learning process can ease some of the pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made. What would you say has been your biggest achievement since we started this journey?

User: My biggest achievement is realizing that I am capable and that my work has value. Knowing I can trust myself has been a major breakthrough.

Consultant: That’s an impressive realization! It’s crucial to recognize your capabilities. Moving forward, what strategies will you implement to ensure you maintain this positive momentum?

User: I will keep journaling my successes, seek feedback more actively, and remind myself of my worth when I face challenges.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! I am confident you can keep up the positive momentum you've built. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support in the future. How are you feeling about wrapping up our sessions?

User: I feel good! I’ve learned a lot about myself, and I feel prepared to take on new challenges. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wei! It’s been a pleasure to support you in this process. I believe in your ability to navigate future challenges confidently. Best of luck, and remember, you can always come back if you need assistance.
