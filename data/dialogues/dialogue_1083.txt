Consultant: Hello, Qiu. I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling recently and what brought you in for this session.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. There’s so much pressure from my classmates and I feel completely isolated. I even thought about taking a break from school, but my parents and teachers disagreed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling with your relationships at school. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been happening with your classmates?

User: Well, ever since I had that argument with my roommates, everything has just felt tense. They don’t include me in anything, and I feel like I'm always on the outside. It makes me feel worthless.

Consultant: It must be really tough to feel excluded like that, Qiu. When you think about those moments with your roommates, what thoughts cross your mind?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just not likable enough or that there must be something wrong with me. I can’t shake off the feeling that I deserve to be treated this way.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts sound really painful. Let's explore those beliefs a little more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you aren’t likable or deserve this treatment?

User: I guess there's no real evidence since I haven't actually talked to them about how I feel. But seeing them laugh and hang out without me just solidifies my feelings of being an outcast.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s easy to jump to conclusions in those situations. If a friend were feeling like this, what would you say to them about their worth or how to approach their friends?

User: I'd probably tell them that everyone has value and that maybe their friends just don’t know how they feel. I wish I could think that way about myself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Let's try to incorporate that kind of thinking into your own situation. What if we approached your fear of being excluded from a different angle? 

User: I suppose if I did reach out to them, maybe I’d find out they didn’t mean to leave me out. Maybe it's just my perception.

Consultant: Exactly! Challenging your initial thoughts can open up new possibilities. What might be a small step you could take to reach out to them?

User: Maybe I could invite them to study together or just join them for lunch. But I’m so afraid they’ll reject me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that fear. Facing that fear might actually help reduce its power over you. Would you be willing to try inviting them, and we can talk about how it goes in our next session?

User: Yeah, I’d like that. I think trying is better than just feeling miserable. But I still worry it won't change anything.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about the outcome. Remember, this is just one step, and it doesn’t define your whole worth. Let’s also reflect on what you learned from our discussions today. How do you feel about the way you’ve been perceiving your situation?

User: I feel like I need to be kinder to myself and give myself a chance to be vulnerable. It just feels hard to change that mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely. Changing thoughts takes time and practice. What’s one thing you can remind yourself when negative thoughts creep in, especially regarding your relationships?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to feel how I feel, but I don’t have to accept those negative beliefs as my truth.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Qiu. Embracing that compassion for yourself can help you navigate your feelings better. As we prepare for our next session, let's talk about how you handle anxiety about your academic performance as well. 

User: I’ve been struggling there too. I’ve lost interest in my studies and I worry I’m falling behind.

Consultant: It sounds like the stress from your relationships is impacting your academics as well. How does thinking about your studies make you feel right now?

User: It makes me feel anxious. Sometimes I just avoid studying altogether because I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Avoidance can often provide temporary relief, but it often leads to more anxiety later on. How about we identify specific actions that might help re-engage you with your studies while managing that anxiety?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could break my study tasks into smaller parts so it feels less overwhelming?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Small, manageable tasks can make a big difference. Would you feel comfortable setting a goal for yourself this week to try this out?

User: Yes, I could set aside 30 minutes a day to focus on a subject instead of trying to study everything at once. 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a very achievable goal. Remember, every little step counts. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s recap your goals: reaching out to your classmates and breaking your studies into smaller tasks. How does this sit with you?

User: It feels more manageable. I think if I can take these steps, maybe I can start feeling better about everything.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember, progress takes time, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share your experiences in our next session. I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Qiu. I look forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I remember from our last session that you've been feeling quite anxious about your academic performance. Could you share how you've been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. My grades have been slipping, and my teacher's criticism hit me hard. I just feel so lost and think maybe taking a break from school would be the best thing for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure and uncertainty, especially with the recent criticism from your teacher. Can you tell me more about how those experiences have affected your feelings towards your studies and school environment?

User: I feel embarrassed and ashamed. It's like everyone is watching me fail. I start doubting my abilities, questioning if I really belong here. It's exhausting.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. It sounds like your self-esteem has taken a hit recently. What thoughts go through your mind when you start to doubt your abilities at school?

User: I often think things like, "I’m not smart enough" or "I'll never catch up." It's like I can't escape those thoughts, and they just spiral.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and overwhelming. It's important to recognize how they are impacting your emotions. Can you identify any situations where those thoughts become particularly strong?

User: It gets worse during exams or when I receive grades back. Just seeing my grades lowers my mood instantly, making me feel trapped.

Consultant: It's understandable that grades can provoke such a strong emotional reaction. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re “not smart enough”?

User: Well, my recent grades aren’t good, and I always struggle to grasp certain topics. It feels like proof that I’m just not cut out for this.

Consultant: I hear that you're linking your grades directly to your worth as a student. However, can we consider some alternative explanations for those grades? For instance, could there be factors outside of your abilities influencing your performance?

User: Maybe. I guess I've been really stressed, and I haven't been sleeping well. It definitely can affect my studying.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Lack of sleep and stress can significantly affect academic performance. What if we try to challenge that negative thought by thinking about times you succeeded or learned something new, despite difficulties?

User: I did manage to do well in a few subjects, like math, when I really focused. But those feel like flukes now.

Consultant: It’s great to hear about those successes! Remember that they demonstrate your capability. How do you feel when you recognize that you’ve been successful in some areas, even under pressure?

User: I feel a bit relieved, like maybe I can do this after all. But then I just think about all the times it didn’t go well.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to replay past failures in our minds. Let’s focus on how to build on those successes. Could we set some short-term goals that might help shift your mindset toward your studies?

User: I guess I could try to focus on one subject at a time rather than everything at once. Maybe that would help.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Breaking things down can make them feel more manageable. Besides setting goals, how do you feel about introducing a positive self-talk strategy? 

User: Not sure what you mean by that. What does it involve?

Consultant: Positive self-talk involves replacing those negative thoughts with encouraging ones. For example, instead of saying "I'm not smart enough," you could say "I’m capable of learning and improving." Does that sound doable?

User: I think I can try that. It seems like it might feel a little silly at first, though.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way at first! With practice, it can become more natural. Would you like to practice some affirmations together today?

User: Sure, I’d be open to that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s come up with a few affirmations together. How about starting with, “I am capable of overcoming challenges”? Do you resonate with that?

User: Yes, I like that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Another could be, “Each step I take brings me closer to my goals." What do you think about that one?

User: That sounds good too. It feels encouraging.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let's discuss your relationship with your dorm mates. How do you feel about your interactions with them while managing your stress?

User: Honestly, I feel quite lonely. It’s hard for me to connect with them, and sometimes I feel judged.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, especially when you're already feeling isolated. What are some small steps you think you could take to bridge that connection with them?

User: Maybe I could ask them to study together or just spend more time in common areas instead of isolating myself.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Engaging in shared activities can build connections and help relieve some of that pressure. How do you feel about trying that out this week?

User: I think I could manage that. It might help me feel less alone.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s an important step towards feeling more connected. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been the most significant takeaway from our session?

User: I think recognizing that I do have capabilities and setting small goals can really help. Also, working on self-talk feels like a good strategy.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, and I’m proud of you for taking those steps. It’s crucial to celebrate your progress! How do you feel now about managing both your studies and your relationships?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful than before. I know it won’t be easy, but I feel like I have tools to start changing things.

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. If things get tough, remind yourself of the skills we’ve discussed. Looking forward, how can you ensure that you're taking time for yourself in this process?

User: I can schedule some breaks during my study sessions. I need to take care of myself too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan. Balance is key! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you're not alone in this. See you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Thank you for coming today. I understand that you’ve been feeling quite pressured and isolated recently. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Well, I'm really struggling with my roommates. After a conflict we had, I feel completely alone in the dorm. Everything feels so hostile, and I just can't seem to shake off this feeling of being outcast.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way in your living situation. I want to understand better how this conflict has affected you. What exactly happened with your roommates?

User: There was an argument about cleanliness, and things just escalated. I ended up saying some things I didn't mean, and I think they took it really personally. Now I just get a cold shoulder from them, which makes me even more upset.

Consultant: I hear you. Conflicts can really impact relationships, especially when emotions run high. How do you feel when you see them ignoring you?

User: I feel frustrated and lonely. It’s like being in a place where I’m not wanted, and that really hurts. Sometimes I think maybe I should just keep to myself and not try to engage, but then that just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a situation where you feel rejected. It seems like you’re caught in a tough cycle. Do you think there are specific thoughts that come to your mind when you feel this way?

User: Yes, I often think that I'm not good enough or that they will never like me. It makes me want to just give up trying to connect with them.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It’s great that you're bringing them to the surface. Can we explore together how these thoughts might be influencing your feelings and actions? 

User: Sure, I mean, whenever I think that way, I don’t feel like talking to them at all. I just want to hide away, which probably just reinforces their perception of me as someone to avoid.

Consultant: Exactly. It’s a challenging cycle where negative thoughts lead to actions that reinforce those thoughts. What might be a more realistic way to view your situation or yourself?

User: I suppose I could tell myself that not everyone will dislike me and that some of them might even want things to improve.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Challenging negative thoughts can really help change how you respond. What steps do you think you could take to reach out to them again?

User: I could maybe try talking to them one-on-one instead of addressing the whole group. I think that could help ease the tension.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Starting with one person could help you feel more comfortable and perhaps foster a more positive interaction. What would you want to say to them?

User: I think I could apologize for overreacting and explain that it wasn’t my intention to hurt anyone. I really just want to move past this.

Consultant: Apologizing can be a powerful step toward healing those relationships. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s necessary. I don’t want this to be the way things are forever.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous about reaching out, but wanting to change the situation is a positive sign. If they respond well, it might help you feel more integrated again. How do you think you’ll manage any anxiety before you speak to them?

User: I guess I could prepare what I want to say beforehand. Practicing it might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Practicing can definitely help alleviate some of that anxiety. After you reach out, how would you feel if the conversation doesn’t go as well as you hope?

User: I suppose I’d feel disappointed, but I would try to remind myself that it’s just one step, and I can keep trying.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective. Remember, even if things don’t go perfectly, you’re taking initiative, and that’s an important aspect of improving your situation. What other supportive actions could you take for yourself in this process?

User: Maybe I could talk to a friend about how I feel, or do something I enjoy to lift my spirits while I work through this.

Consultant: Connecting with a friend sounds wonderful, and engaging in enjoyable activities can definitely help maintain your emotional well-being. How are you feeling about all of this now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. I have some ideas for how to move forward, which is nice to have.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It’s wonderful that you’re feeling a bit more hopeful and equipped with strategies. Remember, this is a process, and it’s okay to take small steps. 

User: Thank you. It feels good to have someone to talk to about all of this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. It’s my pleasure to be here for you. Before we end our session, let’s recap what we discussed today and what steps you plan to take going forward. 

User: Sure. I’ll try to apologize to my roommates, talk to a friend about this, and practice what I want to say to ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps. Remember that setbacks can happen, but it’s important to keep trying. You’re showing great resilience. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help and guidance. I feel a little less alone now.

Consultant: I'm glad to have been able to help today. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here for you if you ever need support moving forward. Best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about how things go in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad you could make it to our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite frustrated and lonely. I tried to connect with my classmates, but it didn't go well. There were misunderstandings, and it's just made me feel like I should give up trying.

Consultant: I understand how difficult it can be to feel isolated, especially when you're making an effort to connect. It sounds like the recent interactions haven’t been as positive as you hoped. Can you share more about what happened?

User: Well, I tried to join a study group, but they seemed to misunderstand my intentions. I ended up feeling awkward, and I felt like they didn't want me there. It's just frustrating because I really wanted to bond with them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel disheartened when things don't go as planned, especially when you put yourself out there. What were some of the specific misunderstandings that occurred?

User: I think they thought I was trying to compete with them rather than collaborate. I didn’t mean it that way at all! I just wanted to be part of the group, but I feel like I've only made it worse.

Consultant: It's easy to see how that could lead to feelings of frustration. Your intention was to connect, but the outcome was the opposite. How did that make you feel in the moment?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit angry. I thought maybe I wouldn’t fit in because I'm different. I started blaming myself for the situation. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, and it’s important to recognize those feelings. Blaming yourself can be a common response in situations where misunderstandings arise. Can we discuss what thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking, “Maybe I’m just not meant to make friends.” I can’t shake the feeling that I need to prove myself because of my height and how I look. 

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. It seems like there’s a lot of pressure on yourself to prove your worth based on how you perceive others see you. What if we explored some of these thoughts a bit deeper? Do you think there might be other explanations for their reactions?

User: I guess I haven't really considered that. Maybe they were just having a bad day or something. But I can’t help but take it personally.

Consultant: That's a great insight! People often have their own challenges that can affect their behavior. It's natural to internalize their reactions. How could you challenge that thought, “I’m just not meant to make friends,” with a different perspective?

User: I suppose I could think that just because some interactions went poorly, it doesn’t define my ability to connect with others. But it’s hard to convince myself of that.

Consultant: It really can be challenging to shift those ingrained thoughts. Perhaps you could frame your experiences as learnings instead of failures? What might you say to a friend who comes to you feeling the same way?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their struggles and it doesn’t mean they won’t find friends eventually. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a supportive and compassionate perspective for others. It might be helpful to extend that same kindness to yourself. Let’s brainstorm some small steps you can take to re-engage with your classmates in a way that feels more comfortable.

User: Okay, maybe I could try starting a conversation with someone during lunch? It seems less intimidating than joining another study group right now.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! A more casual setting could really help. How can you remind yourself that it’s okay to take small steps and that misunderstandings can happen?

User: I could keep a journal of my thoughts after interactions. It might help to see things from a different angle rather than just focusing on the negative moments.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Journaling can help you process your feelings and recognize patterns over time. It will also allow you to celebrate the moments that go well. How does this plan make you feel about reaching out to your classmates again?

User: I feel a bit more encouraged actually. Writing it out might help clear my mind. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Taking steps that resonate with you is key. As we approach the end of our session, let's reflect on the progress you've made today. What stands out to you about our conversation?

User: I realized that I’ve been really hard on myself, and that there's more possibility than I thought. Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, it’s worth trying again.

Consultant: That’s an empowering realization! It’s wonderful to see you recognizing the potential for connection despite past challenges. Remember, it’s all about the journey, not just the destination. How do you feel about applying these new insights moving forward?

User: I feel more positive. I think I can approach things differently now, which gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. You've made significant progress today, and I believe in your ability to continue fostering those connections. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. If you ever need more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here for you!

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I’ll definitely try these new strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear it was helpful. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm really glad to see you again today. Last time we talked about your efforts to connect more with your classmates. How have things been going since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. The group project allowed me to interact more with my classmates, and I think some of the tension I had is starting to ease.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing some positive changes in your interactions. Could you tell me more about what specific aspects of those interactions made you feel more confident?

User: Well, I felt more included during discussions, and I noticed that my classmates were appreciative of my ideas. It felt nice to finally contribute.

Consultant: It's great that you felt valued for your contributions. Feeling included can really enhance our sense of belonging. What would you like to focus on today in terms of maintaining this positive momentum in your relationships?

User: I want to keep building on this. I worry about slipping back into my old ways of feeling isolated or unimportant.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those concerns. Let's explore how we can set some clear and achievable goals for your social interactions to help you stay on track. What do you think would be a helpful step for you?

User: Maybe I could aim to participate in at least one group activity each week or try to connect with a different classmate?

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Engaging in group activities can help reinforce those positive feelings. How do you think you would feel after achieving one of those goals?

User: I think it would make me feel more confident and less anxious about being around others. It would also help me build better relationships.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building those relationships can create a strong support system. What kind of activities do you think you’d like to explore for these interactions?

User: I'm interested in joining a study group or a club that focuses on something I enjoy, like economics or volunteering. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Joining a study group or a club can help you meet new people with similar interests. What would be your first step toward joining one of those?

User: I guess I should look for announcements about clubs or study groups on campus and actually sign up.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! How do you feel about reaching out to someone to find out more about a specific group?

User: I feel a little nervous, but I think it’s necessary. I need to step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: It's perfectly natural to feel nervous, but remember that taking that first step can be incredibly rewarding. Would it help to practice what you might say to someone when you reach out?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I usually freeze up when I try to talk to new people.

Consultant: Let’s think about a simple introduction. You could say something like, "Hi, I saw that you're part of this group, and I’m interested in joining. Can you tell me more about it?" How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! Practicing those conversations can help reduce that freezing feeling. How do you want to track your progress as you work on these interactions in the coming weeks?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write about my interactions and how I felt afterward?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can really help you reflect on your experiences and feelings. What will you do if you find you're having a particularly challenging day or an encounter?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's okay to be nervous and that most people feel that way sometimes. I can also look back at my journal entries for encouragement.

Consultant: That coping strategy is spot on! Reminding yourself that others share similar feelings can help normalize your experience. You've already made a lot of progress, and it sounds like you have a solid plan in place. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful about these steps now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what you’ve decided: reaching out to a classmate or joining a club, tracking your experiences in a journal, and remembering that it’s okay to feel nervous. How does that sound as a plan moving forward?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect. I’m excited to give it a try!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Before we wrap up, how do you feel about your progress in building those connections since we started our sessions?

User: I feel like I’m really starting to make some positive changes, and it’s encouraging to see my confidence returning.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, building relationships takes time, but you’re on the right path. You have the tools to continue this progress. If you face any setbacks, reach out to me anytime. We can work through it together.

User: I appreciate that, and I’ll definitely reach out if I need to.

Consultant: I’m here to support you! Take pride in the progress you’ve made, and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time. Have a great week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling more energized and confident lately. It’s nice to feel like I have support from my peers, especially after that event we talked about.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you’re experiencing a boost in energy and confidence, and that the group support has positively impacted you. Can you share a bit more about that event and how it made you feel recognized?

User: Sure! During the event, I got a lot of compliments from my classmates. For once, it felt like people were actually noticing me in a good way. I felt included and valued.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you felt included and valued! This recognition can be really uplifting and reinforce self-esteem. How has this positive recognition affected your relationship with your peers or your outlook on future social interactions?

User: I think it’s made me more hopeful. I used to dread social situations because I felt overlooked. Now, I feel more willing to engage with others. It’s like a weight has been lifted.

Consultant: That’s an important shift! Feeling lighter and more open to engaging with others can really enhance your social life. What are some specific ways you’ve noticed this change in your interactions?

User: I’ve started initiating conversations more, and I don’t feel as anxious about what others think of me. For instance, I joined a study group and felt comfortable sharing my ideas.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Qu! Joining a study group and contributing your ideas shows a lot of growth. What do you think contributed to this change in your behavior?

User: I think the support from my classmates really helped. Also, reflecting on our previous conversations made me realize it’s okay to be myself and that I have something valuable to offer.

Consultant: It’s powerful that you’re learning to embrace your own value and authenticity. As we move forward, how do you wish to build on this positive momentum in your interpersonal relationships?

User: I want to continue building connections and maybe become more involved in group activities. I think deepening these relationships could help me feel even more confident.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Engaging in group activities can indeed strengthen relationships. What are some specific activities or areas you’re interested in exploring further?

User: I’m thinking about joining a club or volunteering. I want to meet new people and expand my social circle, but I’m also a bit nervous about putting myself out there.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about new opportunities. What strategies can we explore together to help manage that anxiety when you consider joining these new activities?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had lately. It might also help to set small, achievable goals for myself.

Consultant: Excellent insight! Focusing on positive experiences can definitely help reduce anxiety, and setting small goals gives you a manageable way to approach these new situations. What might be your first small goal?

User: Maybe my first goal could be attending one club meeting. Just watching and seeing how it goes before fully participating might ease my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful first step, Qu! Observing first can help you become more comfortable. Once you’ve attended, we can discuss how you felt about the experience. How do you think you'll track your progress afterward?

User: I think I can keep a journal to note down my feelings before and after each event. Writing things down has helped me in the past.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic way to reflect on your experiences! It can provide insight into your thoughts and feelings as you navigate new situations. How do you feel about this method moving forward?

User: I feel good about that. It gives me a sense of control over my thoughts and helps me see my progress clearly.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Keeping track of your feelings can indeed reinforce your sense of control. As you continue your journey, what are some strategies you can use to remind yourself of your achievements and growth?

User: I could review my journal entries regularly. It would be a good way to reflect on my journey and remind myself of how far I’ve come.

Consultant: Absolutely, reflecting on your journey can be incredibly motivating. As we wrap up our session, let’s summarize your goals. You're focusing on engaging more socially by attending a club meeting and using journaling to track your progress. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! I feel excited about the steps I’ll be taking.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Qu! You’ve made impressive strides, and I believe you’ll continue to grow and thrive. Remember, it’s about patience and practice. If you need support in the future, please feel free to return. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I feel much more confident going forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep you updated. 

Consultant: Bye for now, Qu! 

User: Bye!
