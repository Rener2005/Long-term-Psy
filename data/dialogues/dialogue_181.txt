Consultant: Hello, Tang. I’m glad you’re here for our session today. Let's take a moment to talk about how you’ve been feeling recently. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really down lately. After my boyfriend broke up with me, I just feel lost and hopeless about the future. I'm also worried about my upcoming civil service exam—I can’t seem to focus on studying.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Tang. Breakups can be incredibly tough, and it's understandable that you’re feeling this way. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more. What has been the most challenging part for you since the breakup?

User: I keep thinking about the good times we had together, and then it feels like everything is falling apart. It makes me doubt myself, and I worry that I won’t be able to handle my studies or the exam properly.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of negative thoughts, and remembering those good times is intensifying your feelings of loss and self-doubt. Let's try to break that down a bit. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about the breakup and your future?

User: I keep thinking, “I’ll never find someone like him,” and “What if I fail the exam?” It feels so overwhelming, and I’m just scared of what’s ahead.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really heavy, can’t they? Let’s take a closer look at them. When you say, “I’ll never find someone like him,” how true do you feel that statement is? Are there any other perspectives we can consider?

User: I guess it’s a bit exaggerated, but it feels so true right now. It’s hard to believe that I could be happy again, especially with everything happening.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed after a significant loss. Yet, it’s important to challenge those extreme thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what might you say to them to help them see it differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to feel sad, but that they deserve to be happy again and that there are other opportunities out there.

Consultant: Exactly! You would remind them of their worth and that their future can still hold many possibilities. Let’s practice that same kindness toward yourself. What would it look like to replace that thought with something more supportive?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay to feel sad now, but in time, I can find happiness again,” or “I can focus on my studies to prepare for the exam.”

Consultant: That’s a great shift! By acknowledging your feelings and also reminding yourself about your potential, you’re starting to build a more balanced perspective. Let’s connect this to your upcoming exam. How do you feel about your study plan right now?

User: I feel like I can't even start. There are moments when I sit down, but my mind just races back to him and the breakup. 

Consultant: It makes sense that your mind would wander to such a significant event. How about we create small, manageable study goals together? This way, you can gradually build your focus while still allowing yourself to process your emotions.

User: That could help. I think breaking it down into smaller tasks might make it less overwhelming. 

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s start with something simple. What if we set a goal to study for just 25 minutes and then take a short break? This can help reduce the pressure you’re feeling.

User: That sounds doable. I can handle 25 minutes. 

Consultant: Wonderful! And during those breaks, it might be helpful to check in with your feelings. You could take a few moments to breathe and remind yourself of the positive affirmations we just discussed.

User: I could try that. It might help me manage those negative thoughts when they creep back in.

Consultant: Absolutely. Practice is key, and by acknowledging those thoughts without letting them take control, you’re developing a toolkit for coping. How are you feeling about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It gives me something concrete to work on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you go through this process. It’s okay to have ups and downs. As we continue our sessions, we can dig deeper into these emotions and strategies.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Tang. Let’s check in next time about your study progress and how you're feeling overall. What do you think?

User: That would be great. I want to make sure I’m handling everything well.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll keep working on this together. You’re capable of handling these challenges, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you. It means a lot to me.

Consultant: I’m glad! Before we finish today, is there anything else you want to discuss or focus on?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. I’ll focus on my study plan and take care of myself.

Consultant: That sounds perfect, Tang. As you move forward, remember that it’s okay to lean on your support system. You've got this, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.

User: I will. Thank you so much for today! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, you aren’t alone, and I’m here whenever you need me. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Tang! It’s great to see you again. I know you’ve been dealing with a lot lately, especially regarding the breakup. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling all over the place, to be honest. My ex reached out to me recently, checking in, and I didn't expect it. It really threw me off. I’m supposed to be focused on studying for my civil service exam, but now I feel confused and anxious again.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel unsettled when unexpected messages from an ex come up, especially during such an important time. Can you tell me more about how you felt when you received that message from him?

User: When I saw his message, I felt a rush of emotions. I was happy that he thought of me, but then I felt guilty for thinking that way. I want to move on, but a part of me feels happy about the attention. It disrupts my study routine completely.

Consultant: It seems like you're experiencing a mix of emotions—contradictory feelings of happiness and guilt. It can be tough to navigate those feelings while also focusing on your studies. What specific thoughts come to mind when you're trying to study, and his message pops into your head?

User: I start thinking that maybe I should have responded, or maybe he still cares. Then I worry about not being able to concentrate, and I fear that I’ll fail my exams. It’s like a cycle that just won’t stop.

Consultant: That cycle sounds exhausting. Let’s take a moment to unpack those thoughts. When you think about responding or his concerns, what kind of feelings does that bring up? Do you notice any patterns in those thoughts?

User: I feel anxious and trapped. I think maybe I'm just not good enough or that I'll never be able to move on. I second-guess my decision to let him go, even though deep down, I know it’s what I want.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Tang. It’s normal to feel that way after a breakup, especially when there’s lingering contact. Let's explore how we can help you challenge those thoughts of not being good enough or fears about moving on. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: I guess when I think about it, I have done well in school, and I’ve been preparing for my exam. But then, I just feel stuck right now. I can't seem to focus on the positives.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. You’ve achieved success in your studies, which is evidence to challenge the negative thoughts. How about we set a small goal for your study time? What would you like to focus on in our session today?

User: I’d like to find a way to refocus and maybe go back to being productive again. I really want to stop dwelling on his message and my worries about the future.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s create a plan to help you regain that focus. We could explore some techniques for emotional regulation, like mindfulness or setting boundaries in your thoughts when that message comes up. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to learn how to not let it affect my concentration.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can try is to set a specific time. When a thought about your ex arises, note it down but allow yourself to focus on it later, during a “worry time.” Would that be something you’re willing to try?

User: Yes, I think that might help. I often get lost in those thoughts and forget about my studying.

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, let’s practice some relaxation techniques together. Taking moments to calm your mind can also help when you feel overwhelmed. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise now?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I sometimes forget to take deep breaths during the day.

Consultant: Let’s do this together. Take a deep breath in for four counts... hold for four... and breathe out for four. Focus on your breath, letting go of any tension. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice and calming. I think I need to remember to do this when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Incorporating breathing exercises into your daily routine can be very beneficial. Now, as you prepare for your exams, can we discuss what positive steps you can take each day to stay engaged with your studies without getting distracted?

User: Sure. I’m thinking about setting small, achievable study goals each day. That might help break things down.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Setting small goals can make tasks feel less overwhelming. How about setting a goal for today? What can you aim to accomplish in your studying?

User: I think I can try to review a specific topic today instead of the whole syllabus. That feels more manageable.

Consultant: Perfect! Focusing on one topic at a time can help minimize anxiety. Remember to celebrate those small victories, too. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic. It’s nice to have a clear focus and a plan to reduce my worries.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This is a key step toward regaining your confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s talk about how you can maintain these emotional boundaries with your ex moving forward. 

User: I definitely want to set clearer boundaries with myself. It feels healthier.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset. Remember, your focus right now is on your future and your goals. Let’s continue building those boundaries. Before our next session, I’d love for you to practice this plan and see how it felt. 

User: I will definitely try. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Tang. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, and remember, you have the strength to manage this!

Consultant: Hello, Tang! I'm really glad to see you here today. I know we had a discussion about your feelings of anxiety regarding the upcoming civil service exam. Can you tell me how you’ve been feeling recently?

User: Hi! I've been really overwhelmed lately. With the exam results coming soon, I'm just filled with dread. I keep thinking about all the terrible things that will happen if I fail, and I feel like I can’t escape these thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Tang. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're facing such a significant event. Can you share some of the specific thoughts that have been troubling you?

User: I keep imagining how disappointing it would be to my parents if I don't pass. I also feel like I wouldn't know what to do with my life afterward. It’s just really scary.

Consultant: It seems like you're under a lot of pressure from your own expectations and your family's. What do you think would happen if you did not pass the exam? Can we explore some of those thoughts together?

User: I think I would feel like a failure. Maybe my parents would be disappointed, and I wouldn’t have any direction. I don't know what I would do next; it just all seems hopeless.

Consultant: I hear you, Tang. That feeling of hopelessness can be very heavy. But let’s take a moment to examine the evidence for those thoughts. Do you think there could be any other outcomes if you don't pass? 

User: I guess I might just have to try again, but I can't help but feel it would take a long time and be really demotivating.

Consultant: It’s fair to feel concerned about the delays, but let’s challenge that thought together. Is there someone you know who has faced setbacks but still found a path forward?

User: Actually, yes. A friend of mine failed her exam the first time but then passed it later. She went on to have a great career. 

Consultant: That’s a really important example, Tang. Your friend managed to turn things around. How does that story change your thoughts about your potential outcomes?

User: I suppose it shows that failing doesn’t necessarily mean everything is over. There could still be a path forward. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s essential to remember that setbacks can lead to new opportunities. Now, when you start to feel anxious about your own situation, what can help you remember that there is another way?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's not the end of the world and think about other options I have.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Tang! Let’s think about those options now. What are some alternative paths you might consider if you don’t pass this exam?

User: Well, I’ve always been interested in teaching, and I could also look into other jobs in the public sector that don’t require the exam. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful possibilities! Exploring multiple paths can help relieve some of the pressure you’re feeling about this one exam. How does thinking about these alternatives make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit lighter. It’s reassuring to know there are options out there.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Now let's focus on how we can implement some mindfulness techniques to help you manage these anxious feelings. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises or mindfulness practices together?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. I think it could really help me calm down.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise. Just take a moment to find a comfortable position. Close your eyes if you’d like, and take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment... and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. 

User: Alright, I’m doing it now. 

Consultant: Perfect. As you keep breathing, I want you to focus on the rhythm of your breath. With each exhale, imagine letting go of the tension and anxiety. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels kind of refreshing actually. I can feel my shoulders relax a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Tang! Focusing on your breath can help bring you back to the present moment. When you start to feel anxious about the exam or the future, remember you can always return to this breathing technique. 

User: I’ll definitely try to remember that. 

Consultant: Let’s also think about some positive affirmations you can tell yourself during tougher moments. What is something kind you could say to yourself when feelings of doubt arise?

User: Maybe something like “I’ve prepared well, no matter the result, I can handle it.”

Consultant: That’s a lovely affirmation! It emphasizes your preparation and resilience. How does it feel to say that to yourself?

User: It feels encouraging. It’s nice to remind myself that I can face whatever happens.

Consultant: Absolutely, Tang. You indeed have that strength! And as we move forward, what do you think your next steps might be regarding your study plan or preparation for the exam?

User: I think I should create a more structured study schedule and perhaps share it with someone for accountability.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Having a schedule can provide you with a sense of control and reduce anxiety. Would you like to outline a basic plan together?

User: Yes, let’s do that! I think I’d feel more organized.

Consultant: Wonderful! Looking at the time you have left, how many hours a day do you think you could dedicate to studying?

User: I can probably study for about four hours each day if I break it into sessions.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable! We can break it down further—what subjects or areas would you like to focus on during those study sessions?

User: I need to work on my writing and also go through past exam papers.

Consultant: Great focus! We can allocate specific days for writing practices and others for mock exams. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds structured, and I think it’ll help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, progress is key, not perfection. Let’s make sure to acknowledge each small victory on this journey. 

User: Yes, I'll try to celebrate those little wins more often, instead of just focusing on the outcomes.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! As we wrap up, Tang, what would be the most important takeaway from our session today?

User: I think understanding that it’s okay to have alternative paths and being able to manage my anxiety with some techniques we've discussed.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! It’s all about balance, and you’re on your way to managing your anxiety while exploring new options. Remember, you’re not alone through this journey. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate all your support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Tang! I’m proud of the progress you've made today. If you ever need to talk again, I'll be here. Take care of yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello Tang! I'm glad to see you here today. It sounds like you’ve had a lot on your mind lately. How are you feeling about everything right now?

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit better today, thanks to my family’s support. But I still worry about my future career since my boyfriend broke up with me. It’s hard to focus on my civil service exam when I feel this way. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way after a breakup, especially when there are so many important changes happening in your life. Can you share more about what specifically worries you about the civil service exam?

User: I feel like it’s the only option I have right now and what if I fail? It feels like so much pressure. But I also reviewed other potential career paths my parents suggested, and I found some that I really like. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step to explore other career options! It sounds like you’re beginning to see new possibilities for yourself. What did you find interesting about those alternative career paths?

User: Well, I found some options that align with my interests, like marketing and social work. They seem much more engaging than just focusing on the civil service.

Consultant: That's great! It’s important to consider pathways that resonate with your interests. How does realizing there are other options make you feel compared to your focus on just the civil service exam?

User: It feels a little freeing to think I have choices. But I still can’t shake off the fear of not doing well on the exam. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel both relief at finding new options and anxiety about the exam. Maybe we can explore ways to manage that anxiety? What strategies have you considered to help alleviate those worries?

User: I haven’t really thought about strategies. Usually, I just try to avoid thinking about the exam altogether, but that doesn’t really help. 

Consultant: Avoidance can be tempting, but addressing those feelings head-on can often be more effective. We might try a different approach. What if we break down your feelings about the exam into smaller sections? Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you think about it?

User: I keep thinking, “What if I fail?” It just loops in my mind. 

Consultant: That’s a common thought that can create a lot of anxiety. Let’s consider it more closely. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much evidence do you feel supports that thought? 

User: Honestly, I’d say around 7, because I haven’t studied as much lately.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re recognizing the evidence behind that thought. What could be a more balanced perspective on your situation? 

User: I guess I could also think about the fact that I’ve done well in my studies before and that I have time to prepare. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a history of success to draw from. It’s important to remind yourself of your capabilities as you prepare. How do you think focusing on your strengths can help you with both the exam and your exploration of other career options?

User: It might boost my confidence. I know I have skills, but I often forget to appreciate them when I’m anxious. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Tang. Acknowledging your skills can foster a more positive mindset. Would you like to set some small and manageable goals to help you balance your exam preparations with exploring those new career options?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I could set aside dedicated time each week for both studying and researching other careers. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Structuring your time can give you more confidence and reduce anxiety. How about we devise a plan together to help you stay accountable for these goals?

User: I like that idea. Maybe I can create a weekly schedule with specific blocks for studying and researching. 

Consultant: That sounds like an effective way to approach it! Also, how do you feel about discussing your plans with your family or friends to get their support and input on your options? 

User: I think that could help. I sometimes hesitate to share because I feel like I might change my mind, but I know they want to help. 

Consultant: Open communication with your support network can offer guidance and reinforce your decisions. Sharing your developing thoughts may also relieve some pressure. How does it feel to consider involving them in your journey?

User: It feels encouraging! I think they could provide useful feedback and also keep me motivated. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you want to carry forward from this conversation. What strategies, beliefs, or plans can you commit to as you continue this journey toward exploring your career options?

User: I’ll focus on my strengths, work on my goals for studying and exploring careers, and communicate with my family about my thoughts and plans. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! You’re making progress, Tang, and I believe these steps will help build your confidence and enthusiasm for the future. Always remember that you have options and support. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more positive about the future now. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this. Whenever you want to discuss your journey or any new feelings that arise, I’ll be here to help. 

User: I appreciate it! I’ll take these steps and look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Absolutely! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Tang! It's great to see you back for another session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I actually feel quite optimistic these days. I passed the Civil Service exam and got the job opportunity, which is really exciting. But I still worry about how I will adapt to the new work environment.

Consultant: That's such wonderful news, Tang! Congratulations on your success! It's completely normal to have some worries about starting a new job. What specific aspects of the work environment are you feeling uncertain about?

User: I guess I'm worried about fitting in with my colleagues and performing well. I want to make a good impression, but sometimes I doubt myself and my abilities.

Consultant: I understand those feelings. Starting a new job can feel daunting, especially when you want to establish good relationships and prove your capabilities. Looking back at your journey, what strategies or skills do you feel confident using to handle these situations?

User: I think I can use some of the emotional regulation skills we discussed in our sessions, like focusing on my positives and reframing my thoughts when I feel anxious. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It's great that you have those skills to draw upon. Let’s explore how you can apply them in your new role. Can you think of a specific situation at work where you might feel anxious or challenged?

User: I imagine during team meetings, especially if I need to speak up or present my ideas. I can be quite nervous about that.

Consultant: Absolutely, team meetings can trigger anxiety for many people. How do you usually feel before and during those meetings? 

User: Before the meeting, I often feel my heart race and have thoughts like “What if they don’t accept my ideas?” During the meeting, I feel nervous but also try to push through it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to experience those physical and cognitive responses. Let’s work on reframing those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that your ideas might not be accepted? Can we think of alternative outcomes?

User: I suppose I might consider that I have unique perspectives to offer, and my ideas might be valuable to the team. Also, I've succeeded in exams, so I should be capable of contributing. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Tang! It’s vital to remind yourself of your strengths and past successes. If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them to think about?

User: I would tell them to trust their abilities and remember that everyone is there to learn from each other. 

Consultant: That’s really insightful and compassionate advice! How can you apply that same mindset to yourself in your upcoming meetings?

User: I think I can practice positive affirmations before meetings, reminding myself that I am capable and that my contributions matter.

Consultant: Positive affirmations can be a powerful tool. Let's take it a step further—what are some specific affirmations you could use to boost your confidence before those meetings?

User: Maybe something like “I am prepared and have valuable insights to share” or “I belong here, and my ideas matter.”

Consultant: Those affirmations sound fantastic! It’s crucial to internalize that belief. Now, let’s simulate a brief team meeting environment. How would you approach sharing an idea with your colleagues, using the affirmations and strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I would take a deep breath before speaking, remind myself of my affirmations, and then clearly express my idea without rushing, trying to engage my colleagues in the discussion.

Consultant: Perfect! Engaging your colleagues can help build rapport, too. How do you feel about rehearsing that response a couple of times to feel more comfortable with it?

User: That sounds helpful! Rehearsing would definitely boost my confidence and help me feel more prepared for the real situation.

Consultant: Great! Let's practice that response together. Imagine the meeting is starting, and you're about to share your idea. What would you say?

User: Alright… “Hi everyone, I’ve been thinking about our current project, and I have an idea I believe could improve our approach. I think collaborating more closely during the initial stages might help us identify challenges early on…”

Consultant: That was a wonderful start, Tang! How did it feel to articulate that?

User: A little nerve-wracking, but also liberating! I felt proud to express my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, the more you practice, the more natural this will become. Looking ahead, how will you remind yourself to use these strategies when you face challenges at work?

User: I’ll create a checklist of my affirmations and effective strategies so that I can review them when I need a boost of confidence.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on what you've achieved during our time together and how you feel about your journey ahead.

User: I feel like I've gained a lot of insight into my strengths and how to handle my anxieties about starting this job. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned.

Consultant: You’ve made wonderful progress, Tang. It’s been a pleasure guiding you through these skills. You’re well-equipped to embrace this new chapter. Remember, should you need support in the future, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Tang. Take care and best of luck with your new job. You’ve got this!
