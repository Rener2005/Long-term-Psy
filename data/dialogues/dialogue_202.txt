Consultant: Hello, it’s great to see you today. I understand you’ve been going through a tough time lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really angry and embarrassed since an incident with my friends. I tried to help them when they were breaking up, but it ended badly, and one of them slapped me in front of everyone. I can't shake off that humiliation, and it’s affecting my studies. 

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It must have felt humiliating to go through that in front of others. You mentioned that it’s impacting your studies; how are you feeling about your ability to focus on your schoolwork right now?

User: I just can't concentrate. Every time I sit down to study, I start thinking about that situation and feel overwhelmed with anger and sadness. I’m really anxious about the upcoming exams too.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed with those emotions. It sounds like your thoughts about the incident are taking up a lot of space in your mind. Can we explore what you're telling yourself when those feelings come up? What thoughts go through your mind?

User: I keep thinking that I should have handled it differently, and part of me wonders if my other friend is right about me being unfair in the situation. I feel like everyone thinks I’m to blame for the fight.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure from those thoughts. Those could be seen as negative thinking patterns, where you might be blaming yourself for everything that happened. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, or perhaps even contradicts them?

User: I don’t know… I guess my intention was to help, but it didn’t turn out that way. I’m just feeling really isolated now.

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s understandable to feel isolated when friends are arguing. It’s important to recognize that your intention was to support them. Let’s think about how you can reframe those thoughts. If a friend was in your situation, what would you advise them?

User: I would tell them to not blame themselves and remind them that it’s not entirely their fault. But I’m not following my own advice.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s easier to see things clearly for someone else. Maybe we can apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you could acknowledge that it’s okay to make mistakes while trying to help your friends?

User: That sounds fair. I guess I can’t control how others react. 

Consultant: Exactly. Just as we cannot control the responses of others, we can focus on how we respond to our own emotions. What small steps could you take to manage these feelings when they arise, especially as you prepare for exams?

User: I could try to take breaks when I feel overwhelmed and maybe talk to someone about how I feel.

Consultant: That’s a really good idea! Taking breaks can help refocus your thoughts, and sharing your feelings can also reduce that sense of isolation. Is there someone specific you feel comfortable talking to?

User: Maybe I could talk to another friend or a teacher who I trust. I just worry about being judged.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about judgment, but it’s also important to allow yourself the space to be vulnerable. Most people will appreciate your honesty and want to support you. How about we discuss how to frame that conversation to help you feel more at ease?

User: Sure, I think that would help. I just don’t want them to think less of me.

Consultant: It might be helpful to express that you’re reaching out because you value their perspective and need their support. This can foster understanding rather than judgment. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I can try to be clear about my feelings and stress that I’m not looking for advice, just someone to listen.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Venting can be so helpful without adding the pressure of needing immediate solutions. As you navigate through this, do you have any specific strategies in mind for addressing the anxiety about your upcoming exams?

User: I think I need to create a study plan that I can follow without putting too much pressure on myself. 

Consultant: A study plan sounds like a wonderful way to give yourself structure and reduce anxiety! What would that plan look like for you in a practical sense?

User: I could break down my subjects into smaller tasks and set realistic goals for each day.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Breaking things down can make studying feel less overwhelming. How would you feel about setting aside specific times to relax as well?

User: I could include some time for relaxing and doing things I enjoy. Maybe watching a show or going for a walk.

Consultant: Incorporating relaxation is essential! It’s a balance between work and rest. How have those types of activities made you feel in the past?

User: They usually help me feel better. It’s just hard to pull myself away when I’m stuck in my head.

Consultant: Getting stuck in your head can be quite draining. What techniques have you found helpful in the past to pull yourself out of that mental space?

User: I sometimes listen to music or do some breathing exercises.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Let’s integrate those into your daily plan as tools to use whenever you feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about this overall approach we’ve discussed today?

User: It feels like a step forward. I'm still angry and embarrassed, but I think I can handle it better now.

Consultant: That’s a constructive way to look at it! Remember, it’s okay to feel those emotions. Acknowledging them is a critical part of processing what happened. Before we wrap up, let’s go over what you want to focus on moving forward so we can continue to build on this progress.

User: I want to try and manage my emotions better, especially during exams, and to talk to someone about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That’s a strong plan. Emotional management and reaching out for support will be crucial. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you ever need to revisit any of these topics, I’m here for you. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad you reached out today, and I believe in your ability to navigate through these challenges. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, A! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty anxious. I’m still trying to work things out with my friend in the dorm, but it feels like no progress has been made, and that makes everything more stressful.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really challenging for you. It sounds like the situation with your friend has been weighing on you, especially with exams coming up. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been difficult?

User: Well, I really want to fix our friendship, but the attempts to talk things out just haven’t worked. I keep thinking about how isolated I feel and that other classmates might be judging me for it.

Consultant: That sounds painful. Feeling isolated can be overwhelming, especially when you’re already dealing with exam-related anxiety. What thoughts come to your mind when you consider your current situation with your friend?

User: I think that maybe I’ve done something wrong and that she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. It makes me feel really sad and anxious about being around her.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to carry a lot of weight for you. It’s understandable to feel sad and anxious when friendships are strained. If you don’t mind, let's explore those thoughts further. How do they affect your feelings and actions?

User: When I think she doesn't want to be my friend, I feel rejected. It makes me want to avoid her, but that just makes me feel lonelier.

Consultant: It sounds like that thought leads to a cycle of avoidance, which ultimately intensifies your feelings of loneliness. Can we take a moment to examine that belief? How much evidence do you have that she really doesn’t want to be your friend?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have solid proof. We just haven’t talked much since the conflict, and it feels like she's distant.

Consultant: It makes sense that her distance would lead to such thoughts. However, perhaps there are other interpretations. What if she’s also feeling unsure about the situation or is struggling with her own feelings? How does that perspective resonate with you?

User: I hadn’t considered that. It might be true that she feels awkward too, but it still doesn’t change my feelings of rejection.

Consultant: Absolutely. Your feelings are valid, and acknowledging them is important. Let’s think about how you might approach this situation differently. If you could talk to your friend openly, what would you want to communicate?

User: I would want to tell her that I miss our friendship and that I really want to work things out, but I'm scared she might not feel the same way.

Consultant: It sounds like expressing your feelings could be a valuable step. How do you think you could frame that conversation in a way that feels less daunting?

User: Maybe I could start by asking her how she feels and then share my feelings afterwards. That way, it won't feel like I'm putting too much pressure on her.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach! Opening with a question allows for a two-way conversation, which is crucial in rebuilding trust. What would it mean for you to take that step?

User: I think it would make me feel more in control. Plus, it could help clear the air and maybe even rebuild our friendship.

Consultant: That’s a very proactive mindset. Working towards control and clarity can certainly help alleviate some of that anxiety. What are some small steps you could take to prepare for that conversation?

User: I could write down what I want to say and maybe practice it with someone to feel less nervous.

Consultant: Great idea! Practicing can really help reduce anxiety. What thoughts come to mind about how your conversation might go if you approach it this way?

User: I suppose it could go well if she’s open to talking. I just have to remind myself that I’m taking a step forward.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s about making progress. You’re already being courageous by wanting to address this. How does this shift in your thinking make you feel about approaching the situation?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. It's reassuring to think that maybe she's feeling something similar.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling. Let’s shift to another aspect. How do you think engaging in this conversation might impact your feelings of isolation and anxiety?

User: If we could talk and reconnect, I think it would help alleviate a lot of my anxiety and I wouldn’t feel so alone anymore.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Reconnecting could have a positive ripple effect on your emotional well-being. As we wrap up today, what steps do you think you can take in the coming week to move towards this conversation?

User: I will write my thoughts down and find a time to talk with her. I think I can do this!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, taking it one step at a time is key. I believe you can do this, A. You’ve shown much resilience today. Before we finish, what thoughts or feelings do you want to take with you from our conversation?

User: I want to keep in mind that it’s okay to express my feelings and that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful takeaway. You’re capable of making positive changes in your relationships. If ever you need support, I’m here for you. Take care until next time, A!

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared for what’s next. See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it’s great to see you again! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I still feel quite lonely and frustrated. The challenges with my dorm relationships have been really hard on me, and I find myself questioning my social skills more than ever.

Consultant: I understand how difficult that can be. It sounds like you’re feeling isolated and doubting yourself in social situations. Let's explore your feelings a bit more. Can you share a specific incident that made you feel this way?

User: Well, there was a group event last week, and when I tried to join in, I just felt awkward and out of place. I couldn't connect with anyone, and it made me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling disconnected in social settings can be very challenging. When you felt awkward, what thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "Why can’t I just be like them?" and "Maybe I’m not meant to fit in anywhere." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very discouraging. It’s understandable to compare yourself to others in those moments, but let’s take a closer look at those beliefs. How do you think those thoughts affect your confidence and interactions with others?

User: They make me feel even more anxious. I start avoiding social situations because I fear I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: Avoidance can often create a cycle where it’s even harder to engage socially. If you had to evaluate those thoughts—"I’m not meant to fit in"—what evidence do you have to support or challenge this belief?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. Some people have said nice things to me, but I just overlook them.

Consultant: It’s common to focus on the negatives and overlook the positives. Let’s try to challenge those negative thoughts. If a friend told you they felt they didn’t fit in, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their unique qualities and that they should give themselves more credit.

Consultant: That's a compassionate response! So, how can you start applying that same kindness to yourself? 

User: I suppose I could remind myself that I do have good qualities and that it’s okay not to be perfect in social situations.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about recognizing your self-worth. Let’s also think about some small steps you can take to practice socializing without the pressure of perfection. What’s one small social interaction you could try this week?

User: Maybe I could join a study group for my exams? It feels a bit less intimidating than a bigger social event.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in a study group gives you a common goal and can help ease those social fears. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel somewhat nervous, but also a bit hopeful. It seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Remember, small steps can lead to bigger changes. After the study group, how will you assess your experience? 

User: I think I’ll focus on how I feel after participating rather than how I think I performed.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset. Focusing on your feelings can offer a clearer insight into your progress. How can you celebrate even small successes in this journey?

User: I could treat myself to something I enjoy after attending the group. 

Consultant: That’s a lovely way to reward yourself! Celebrating achievements, no matter how small, reinforces positive behavior. Are there any additional thoughts or feelings about our discussion today?

User: I feel like I can see a path forward now. I know it’ll take time, but I think I have some ways to improve my situation.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, change takes time and patience. Reflecting on your progress is essential. How will you look back on this session in the coming weeks? 

User: I think I’ll remind myself how I started to challenge my negative thoughts and the importance of small steps.

Consultant: Exactly! Keep building on that realization. As we wrap up, what’s one key takeaway you want to carry forward from today’s conversation?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to not be perfect, and I need to give myself credit for trying.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! You’re making great strides in understanding yourself better. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Remember, I’m here for you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it’s great to see you today! I’m really looking forward to our conversation. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your social skills and studies?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good overall. I’m excited about how I’ve been using those new social skills, and it’s given me a bit more confidence. But I’m also a bit anxious about the upcoming exams.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more confident in your social skills! It sounds like you're successfully applying what you've learned. Regarding your anxiety about exams, can you share more about what specifically is making you feel anxious?

User: I guess it’s mainly the fear of not performing well. I really want to do my best, but sometimes I freeze up when I think about it. I can't help but worry about disappointing myself or others.

Consultant: I can understand how that fear of not meeting expectations would create a lot of anxiety. It’s completely normal to feel this way before exams. When you find yourself feeling that pressure, what thoughts tend to go through your mind? 

User: I often think things like “What if I fail?” or “I should have studied more.” Those thoughts really make me feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some automatic thoughts that contribute to your anxiety. Those thoughts can create a sense of urgency and pressure. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that suggests you might fail, and are there times when you have succeeded despite feeling anxious?

User: Well, I did pretty well on my last practice exam, and I’ve been studying regularly. But still, the fear creeps in.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the success you've had in the past! It seems like there is some evidence that suggests you can succeed, despite your fears. Instead of focusing solely on the worst-case scenario, can you think of an alternative thought that might be more balanced?

User: Maybe I could think, “I will do my best, and that’s enough”? That sounds better than thinking I’m guaranteed to fail.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! “I will do my best, and that’s enough” is a much more supportive thought. This affirmation can help reduce your anxiety and create a more empowering mindset as you prepare for your exams. How does saying that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit lighter! I can see how that could help. I also want to improve my study habits so I can feel more prepared.

Consultant: Focusing on effective study habits is a great way to feel more in control and prepared for your exams. What specific study techniques do you currently use, and what do you think might help you improve your study routine?

User: I usually just read my notes, but I think I could use some active studying methods, like summarizing what I read or practicing with flashcards. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Active studying can really enhance retention and understanding. How about we create a structured plan for your study sessions, incorporating these techniques? This way, we can also keep track of your progress.

User: That sounds good! I’d like to have a clear plan to follow each week leading up to the exams.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s outline a plan that includes specific study sessions using those active methods, along with breaks to prevent burnout. How many days a week do you feel you can dedicate to studying?

User: I think five days a week would work for me, maybe a few hours each day.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid commitment! How about we set specific goals for each study session, like covering certain topics or completing a set number of flashcards? 

User: Yes, that way I can track what I accomplish and feel more organized! 

Consultant: Exactly! This will not only help you stay on track but will also build your confidence as you complete each session. Let’s also schedule a time to review how you’re feeling about this plan. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really helpful! I would love to check in on how things are going. 

Consultant: Great! Regular check-ins can help keep you motivated and allow us to adjust the plan as needed. It’s also important to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. What do you think you can do to reward yourself after a productive study session?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some time with my friends afterward or watch an episode of my favorite show!

Consultant: Those sound like great rewards! It's important to balance study and relaxation. Keeping time for enjoyable activities can help maintain your motivation. How do you feel about having a study and reward balance?

User: I feel more motivated to study knowing there’s something fun afterward. I think that’ll really help keep my spirits up!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Balancing work and play can definitely create a positive cycle. As we work towards your exams, remember to keep reinforcing those empowering thoughts about doing your best and embracing the progress you make. 

User: I will definitely try to keep that in mind. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. This session has been productive. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you would like to discuss or any questions you have?

User: No, I think we covered everything I needed today. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Just remember, I’m here to help you through this process. We’ll check in on your study plan in our next session. You’re doing great! 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next talk! 

Consultant: Me too! Take care, and good luck with your studies until then! 

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. My mood has improved, and I feel confident about my studies. I’ve kept up with my study and social plans, so I'm excited but a little nervous about the exams.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re in a much better place. Can you tell me more about what you think has contributed to your improved mood and confidence regarding your studies?

User: Well, I’ve been sticking to my study schedule, and I've also made sure to take breaks and hang out with friends. That balance really helps me stay focused.

Consultant: It seems like you found a good balance between work and relaxation. Maintaining that balance is important. Could you share what specific strategies you've been using to stay organized and focused on your studies?

User: I use a planner to jot down my study tasks, and I break them into smaller, manageable parts. I also include fun activities with friends in my schedule to keep my spirits up.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective approach! Breaking tasks into smaller components can make them feel less overwhelming. As the exams are approaching, what’s one thing you’re most proud of regarding your preparation?

User: I think I’m proud of how I’ve managed my anxiety better than before. I used to worry a lot, but now I feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s an important achievement! Feeling in control can significantly reduce anxiety. As you prepare for the exams, what concerns do you still have, if any?

User: I guess I’m just worried about the pressure on the exam day. I want to perform well, but I hope I can keep my nerves in check.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel pressure as the exam approaches. Let’s explore some strategies to help you stay calm on the big day. Have you tried any techniques before exams that helped you manage nerves?

User: I usually try to do some breathing exercises, and it helps a little, but I still feel anxious during the actual exam.

Consultant: Breathing exercises are a good start. How about we expand on this? We can create a simple plan with practical techniques you can use right before and during the exam to maintain your calmness. Are you open to that?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I definitely want to feel more relaxed on the exam day.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s think about a few strategies. For instance, you could practice visualization before the exam, picturing yourself sitting calmly and focused. Would you find that helpful?

User: I think so! It might help me focus better and not get caught up in worrying too much.

Consultant: Exactly! Visualization can create a positive mindset. Also, let’s incorporate affirmations—short, positive statements you can remind yourself of during the exam to boost your confidence. What’s a phrase that resonates with you?

User: Maybe something like “I’m prepared, and I can do this”?

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! It can reinforce your confidence. We can develop a plan for when to practice these techniques in the coming weeks. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! Practicing them regularly might help me feel ready for anything.

Consultant: Yes, consistency is key. Let's set aside some time in your planner each week for these practices, both for your breathing exercises and visualization. We can check in next session to see how that’s been working for you.

User: Sure! I can do that. It’ll be good to have a routine.

Consultant: Excellent! Alongside these techniques, let’s also discuss how you can reflect on your experiences after the exams, both regarding your emotional state and your performance. How do you feel about reviewing your feelings post-exams?

User: That sounds helpful. I want to learn from the experience regardless of the results.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about growth. I recommend jotting down your thoughts after the exams, noting any emotions you feel and what strategies worked or didn’t work. Does that sound manageable?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. I like the idea of reflecting on my experience.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflection will help you build on your successes and learn from any challenges. As we wrap up, how do you feel about your plans for managing your emotions and performance during the exams?

User: I feel pretty optimistic now! I have a plan in place, and I’m excited to try out new techniques.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, A! You’ve made significant progress. Remember to hold onto that optimism and confidence as you prepare for your exams. We can build on this in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and advice. I’m looking forward to our next session to see how things go.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before we meet again. Good luck with your practices, and I'll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. I'm satisfied with how the exams went and my relationships with friends have improved too. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've managed to navigate some significant challenges. Can you share more about what specifically has contributed to your recent positive feelings?

User: I think the support from my family has really helped. They were there for me when I was feeling overwhelmed. Also, talking things out with my friends made a difference.

Consultant: Family support can make such a big difference, especially during stressful times like exams. How are you feeling about your relationships with your friends now?

User: We had a few misunderstandings before, but we've talked everything out. I feel much closer to them now, which is really nice.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong resolution! Building and mending relationships can be very fulfilling. Do you feel that this stability and support are helping you manage any stress related to your studies?

User: Yes, I feel a lot less pressure now. But I still worry about how to maintain this balance going forward, especially with future challenges.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have concerns about maintaining your stability in the face of upcoming challenges. What strategies do you think could help you continue this balance as you approach new stresses?

User: I think continuing to talk to my family and friends will be key. Also, maybe establishing a study routine to keep me on track.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Establishing a routine can provide structure and clarity, which may help minimize stress. Is there a particular routine you have in mind, or would you like help creating one?

User: I’m not entirely sure. I think it would help to set specific times for studying and breaks, but I’m worried I might not stick to it.

Consultant: It's common to feel uncertain about sticking to a routine at first. How about we work together to create a flexible plan that accounts for your preferences and allows for breaks? We can also discuss ways to hold yourself accountable.

User: That sounds helpful! I think having a plan would give me more confidence. 

Consultant: Absolutely! We can create a plan that feels manageable. Can you tell me what your current study habits look like, and where you might like to start?

User: Right now, I just study whenever I feel like it, which is kind of random. I want to be more organized.

Consultant: A more organized approach can make a big difference. How many days a week do you feel you can dedicate to studying, and for how long each day?

User: Maybe five days a week, for about two to three hours after school? 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid commitment! We can break those hours down into focused sessions with short breaks. How does that sound?

User: I like that! It would help me stay focused without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! Keeping those sessions focused with breaks can really enhance your productivity. What activities do you think would help you recharge during those breaks?

User: I enjoy going for walks and listening to music. Sometimes I’ll chat with friends too.

Consultant: Those are perfect choices! They can help clear your mind and refresh your energy. Let’s also think about how you can carve out time for these activities during your breaks. Would you like to include some of these in your routine?

User: Yes, I think that would keep me motivated! 

Consultant: Perfect! Having enjoyable activities to look forward to can make the entire studying process feel less daunting. How about we also discuss some techniques to keep your motivation up throughout this routine?

User: I’d like that! I sometimes find it hard to stay motivated, especially towards the end of a long study day.

Consultant: It’s common to experience those dips in motivation. One strategy is to set small, achievable goals for each study session, rewarding yourself with a break or enjoyable activity after completing them. What do you think about that?

User: I think that could really help! I like the idea of having small rewards after I finish a session.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rewards can boost your motivation significantly. Is there a particular reward you think you might enjoy after a good study session?

User: Maybe watching an episode of my favorite show or having a small snack I like.

Consultant: Those are great rewards! They can provide that extra incentive to complete your tasks. As you think about implementing this new routine and reward system, how do you feel about facing potential challenges that may come up?

User: I guess I'm a bit nervous about it, but talking about it here makes me feel more prepared.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit anxious about change, but it sounds like you're developing a solid plan. If challenges arise, remember that it’s okay to adjust your routine to find what works best for you. How would you like to approach these potential adjustments?

User: I think keeping an open mind and being flexible would help. 

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset! Flexibility can ease pressure when things don't go exactly as planned. How else can I support you in feeling more prepared for the journey ahead, particularly in managing stress and maintaining friendships?

User: Just having these conversations helps a lot. I feel like I have more tools now to handle my feelings.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about building your toolkit for future challenges. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you feel are your key takeaways from our session.

User: I feel more confident about setting up a study routine with breaks and rewards. I also understand how to communicate with my friends about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights! You’ve made significant progress in recognizing your needs and how to address them. Remember to keep the lines of communication open with your family and friends. If challenges arise, you can always adjust your plans. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped to handle what’s ahead. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been wonderful working with you. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, I’m here to help. Good luck, and take care! 

User: Thanks, I will! See you next time!
