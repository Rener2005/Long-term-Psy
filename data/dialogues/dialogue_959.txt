Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. To be honest, I still feel pretty low. The pressure from my thesis and the lack of guidance from my supervisor makes me really anxious. I often question my abilities.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and isolated. Can you tell me more about what specific moments or thoughts have been contributing to these feelings?

User: Well, whenever I sit down to work on my thesis, I get this sinking feeling. I think about how my supervisor is not around, and I can't shake off the doubt that maybe I'm not cut out for this.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way given the circumstances. When you sit down to work and those doubts arise, what thoughts come to your mind specifically? 

User: I often think, “What if I fail? What if my thesis isn’t good enough?” It’s like a loop of negative thinking that I can’t escape.

Consultant: That sounds tough, D. It seems like those thoughts are really holding you back. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally when they come up?

User: They make me feel even more anxious and hopeless. It's like I’ve completely lost motivation to work on it.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s difficult when those feelings build up. Let's explore those thoughts a little more. Do you notice if they tend to be more extreme or all-or-nothing?

User: Yes, definitely. I tend to think in extremes—either I do really well or I fail completely. There’s no in-between for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a cognitive distortion called “all-or-nothing thinking.” Recognizing this pattern is an important step. Can you think of times when things didn’t turn out as badly as you feared?

User: I remember a few projects that I was really anxious about, but they turned out okay in the end. I guess I didn’t fail as badly as I thought I would.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like even though you felt that fear, the outcome was not as catastrophic. Can we shift your thinking towards a more balanced perspective by considering a mix of possibilities? 

User: Yeah, I can try that. I suppose not everything has to be perfect for it to be good.

Consultant: Exactly! And recognizing that it’s okay to have imperfections can help reduce the pressure you’re feeling. What would it look like for you to set more realistic expectations for yourself with your thesis?

User: Maybe I can set smaller goals instead of just focusing on finishing the whole thing. That might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach. Setting smaller, achievable goals could help reduce anxiety and provide you with a sense of accomplishment. What’s one small step you could take this week regarding your thesis?

User: I could start by outlining my main points. It seems less daunting than writing a full chapter.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, D! Outlining is a great first step. How will you hold yourself accountable for this goal? 

User: I guess I can set aside a specific time each day to work on it, even if it's just for 30 minutes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Committing to a daily practice will help create a routine and might make it feel more manageable. How do you feel about taking this small step?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It’s nice to think that I can make progress without overwhelming myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s also consider how you can celebrate these small successes as you reach them. What do you think might work for you?

User: Maybe treating myself with something nice after each completed section? Like going for a coffee.

Consultant: I love that idea! Celebrating your accomplishments, no matter how small, will help motivate you further. How do you think this new plan might help improve your mood overall?

User: It gives me a sense of direction and control, which I haven't felt in a while. I think it could really help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining back a sense of control is vital. As we come to the end of our session today, what are some key takeaways you want to focus on moving forward? 

User: I want to work on recognizing my negative thoughts and replacing them with more realistic ones, and to set smaller, manageable goals for my thesis.

Consultant: Those are great goals, D! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I'm proud of you for identifying these steps today. 

User: Thanks! I’ll do my best to focus on these points. 

Consultant: I believe in you! Don’t forget that you're not alone in this. We’ll check in on your progress next time. You can always reach out if you need support in between sessions. 

User: Thank you for your support. I appreciate this a lot!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'll see you in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi, well... I still feel quite down. Being back home didn't help as much as I hoped. My family expects a lot from me, especially with graduation coming up. It just adds to my stress.

Consultant: I understand that you feel a lot of pressure from your family and your upcoming graduation. That sounds really challenging. Can you share more about how these expectations make you feel?

User: It feels overwhelming. I always feel like I’m not living up to what they want from me. I should be studying harder or doing more, but instead, I just feel stuck and anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt due to these expectations. When you think about your studies or graduation, what specific thoughts pop into your mind?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, I will disappoint my family. It makes me anxious just thinking about it, which leads to me not wanting to study at all.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling caught in a loop of anxiety and avoidance. It’s important to recognize these thoughts. What kind of feelings do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and sadness. It's frustrating because I want to do well, but the pressure just makes it worse. 

Consultant: It seems like the pressure is really clouding your motivation to study. Let's talk about the thought that if you don't do well, you'll disappoint your family. Can we explore the evidence for that thought together?

User: Well, I just think they have high hopes for me. They sacrificed a lot to support my education. I don’t want to let them down.

Consultant: That’s understandable, given their sacrifices. But what evidence do you have that they would be disappointed just based on your performance? Have they expressed this directly to you?

User: No, they haven't said it directly. It's more of my own belief. I just feel like their love is conditional on my success.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. It seems like your belief might be influencing how you view their expectations. How would you feel if you considered the idea that their support isn't just based on your achievements?

User: I guess it would feel freeing. I never thought about it that way. It would take some pressure off me to think they would still be proud of me no matter what happens.

Consultant: Exactly! Understanding that their love and support may not be conditional can be liberating. Let's work on some alternative thoughts you can remind yourself of when those anxious thoughts come up. What could you say instead?

User: Maybe something like, "They care about me, not just my grades." 

Consultant: That’s a great start! You could also remind yourself that everyone has ups and downs, and that it’s okay to not be perfect. How do you feel about practicing this new thought?

User: It seems manageable! I just worry about slipping back into negative thought patterns. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those concerns. To help manage this, we can set a small goal for yourself. What is one small step you could take this week to challenge those negative thoughts?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time each day to study for just one hour, and remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! One hour a day is a realistic start, and focusing on the process rather than the outcome can help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. It sounds achievable.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also discuss some ways to remind yourself of this while you’re studying. What strategies can help you maintain this focus on progress rather than perfection?

User: I could write a note and put it on my desk, something encouraging to look at whenever I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Having a physical reminder can reinforce that positive thought. When you're feeling anxious, seeing that note could help steer your focus back to your progress. How do you think this will support your study routine?

User: I think it would help a lot. It’s nice to have a visual reminder that I won’t be judged just for my grades.

Consultant: Absolutely. It's great that you’re recognizing the importance of self-compassion. As we come to the end of our session today, let’s recap what you've learned and how you plan to apply it this week. 

User: I’ve realized that my family’s support goes beyond my performance, and I've set a goal to study for one hour a day, using a reminder note.

Consultant: Wonderful! You’ve made significant progress in challenging those negative thoughts. Remember that it’s a journey, and practicing self-kindness will help you along the way. If you encounter any difficulty, try to share those feelings as they arise.

User: I appreciate that. It feels reassuring to have these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, D! You've done some great work today, and I'm looking forward to hearing how your week goes next time. Remember, you’re capable of managing these challenges.

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best to remember that.

Consultant: You’re welcome. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, I'd like to check in with you about how you're feeling lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite down, especially after trying to get feedback from my supervisor. It seems like I can't do anything right, and my self-doubt has only gotten worse.

Consultant: It sounds really tough, D. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when external feedback isn't what you hoped for. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you face these challenges?

User: I just think maybe I'm not cut out for this. Sometimes I feel like I should give up on my research. It's overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy. It's common to have those thoughts when we encounter difficulties. Let's break it down a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not capable of succeeding in your research?

User: Well, I got a lot of criticism from my last work, and it made me doubt my abilities. It feels like I'm not making any progress, and that really discourages me.

Consultant: I can hear how much that criticism affects you. It’s difficult to keep going when we feel like we’re not making progress. Are there any positive feedback or successes you've experienced along the way, even if they seem small?

User: Sometimes my classmates say I have good ideas or that I explain things well. But it just doesn’t feel enough compared to what my supervisor expects.

Consultant: It's important to recognize those compliments from your classmates. It shows you have strengths and contributions worth acknowledging. How can we take some of that positive feedback and use it to challenge the negative self-talk you experience?

User: I guess I could remind myself of those moments when I feel overwhelmed or doubt myself. But it sounds easier said than done.

Consultant: Absolutely, it is easier said than done, but it's a great start. Perhaps we could try creating some positive affirmations based on the feedback you've received. What would be a good affirmation for you, reflecting your strengths?

User: Maybe something like "I have valuable ideas, and I can improve." But part of me still feels skeptical about it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel skeptical. It’s a process of training your mind to focus on the positive. Would you be open to trying that affirmation every day and seeing how it makes you feel over the next week?

User: Yeah, I can try that. But what if it doesn’t work?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, D. Remember, it’s about the practice of challenging negative thoughts. If one approach doesn’t resonate, we can explore others together. It's all about finding what works for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I guess I need to be patient with myself.

Consultant: Patience is key, and self-compassion is crucial too. Mistakes and setbacks are part of growth. Let’s think about some actions you can take to remind yourself of your progress. What small steps can you take this week that feel manageable?

User: Maybe I can dedicate a few hours to work on my ideas and reach out to my classmates for their thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Engaging with your classmates can provide support and a fresh perspective. Remember to celebrate those small victories. How do you think you'll feel after taking those steps?

User: I hope I’ll feel more confident and less isolated. Talking to them might help me gain some clarity.

Consultant: Connecting with others can be really beneficial. It seems you’re starting to see the potential for improvement. This is an important realization. What could you do if you start feeling overwhelmed again?

User: I could remind myself to step back, maybe use the affirmation and talk to someone instead of shutting myself off.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about building a toolkit for yourself. This week, if you encounter those overwhelming feelings, you now have a strategy. You’re developing greater awareness and proactive steps to manage those emotions. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels good. I feel a bit more in control. I also like the idea of having a strategy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, D. You’ve already taken significant steps towards strengthening your emotional management. As we wrap up today, what is the most valuable insight you’re taking with you from our session?

User: I think understanding that I can challenge my negative thoughts and focusing on my strengths is very helpful. I need to give myself some credit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your strengths is a powerful tool for change. Remember to practice those affirmations and reach out for support when you need it. If similar feelings surface, you have strategies to employ. Shall we plan to check in on your experiences at our next session?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I look forward to it.

Consultant: Great! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, D, and remember, you're not alone in this journey. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad to see you again. Last time we talked about your understanding of emotional management. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been trying to apply what I learned, but I still feel a bit lost sometimes, especially in social situations. I do feel slightly better, though.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better! Let's explore those social situations. Can you tell me about a recent experience where you felt lost or uncertain?

User: Well, last week I attended a group study session, but I struggled to engage with others. I felt like they were talking about things I didn't fully understand.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s understandable to feel that way in group settings. What thoughts went through your mind while you were in that session?

User: I kept thinking that I must seem dumb for not keeping up. It made me anxious to speak up, and I just stayed quiet.

Consultant: I see. It seems like those thoughts might have made you feel worse and led to avoidance. Let's look at those thoughts—how valid do you think they were? Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts those feelings?

User: I guess there's no evidence that supports that I seem dumb. But it just feels that way when I can't follow along.

Consultant: It’s common to have those thoughts, especially when you're feeling insecure. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it's okay to ask questions and that not everyone understands everything all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! You'd encourage them to reach out and seek clarity. How about we work on reframing your thoughts to be more supportive like that? 

User: That sounds helpful. I want to be able to speak up without feeling so hesitant.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's practice together. Next time you find yourself in a similar situation, what if you remind yourself that it's okay to ask for clarification? 

User: I can try that. I like the idea of asking questions instead of just sitting quietly.

Consultant: Great! And when you catch yourself thinking negatively during those moments, try asking yourself, “What would I tell a friend?” It can help shift your perspective. 

User: I think that might work. I will definitely give it a shot.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, D! Besides this, have you engaged in any activities or social settings that brought you joy recently? 

User: I went to a small gathering with classmates, and it was nice. I felt more relaxed there.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Those moments of connection can boost your mood. What about that gathering made you feel relaxed?

User: I think it was just being around friendly faces and having casual conversations without pressure. 

Consultant: That's a beautiful experience. Perhaps trying to create more of those relaxed environments could help? 

User: Yes, I want to do that! 

Consultant: How about we brainstorm some ideas for upcoming gatherings or activities that would feel comfortable for you to participate in? 

User: I could invite a couple of friends over to study or play games. Just a small, familiar group.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! This type of interaction can reinforce those positive feelings and social skills. 

User: I'm excited about it! Just sometimes I worry that they might not want to hang out.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way. What could you say to yourself in those moments to help ease that worry? 

User: I guess I could remind myself that they enjoy my company, and I just need to reach out. 

Consultant: Yes! Focusing on that positive connection can be very reassuring. Let’s keep practicing those shifts in thought.

User: I feel more encouraged now. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, D! Remember, it's all about trial and error, and reaching out is a sign of strength. 

User: I will keep that in mind for the next time!

Consultant: As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've learned. What will you take away from our session?

User: I think I’ll focus on reframing my thoughts and putting myself out there more with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Keep nurturing those positive connections. If you face any challenges, remember I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help through this process.

Consultant: You’re welcome, D! I’m proud of your progress. This is just the beginning; stay open to new experiences, and we can continue to work on it together. 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, D!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to engage more with my new friends from the extracurricular activities, and it’s been nice. But I sometimes still worry about whether I'm doing it right.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! It’s encouraging to hear you’re engaging with your friends. Can you share a bit more about what you’re worried about specifically? What does "doing it right" mean to you?

User: I guess I worry about saying the wrong things or not fitting in. Sometimes I think they might not actually enjoy my company.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re concerned about how others perceive you, which is quite common. Can you tell me about a recent social interaction that made you feel this way?

User: I went to a small gathering last week, and while everyone was chatting, I felt I was just sitting there awkwardly. I didn’t know how to join in the conversation.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, D. It makes sense that feeling left out would contribute to your worries. What thoughts were running through your mind during that gathering?

User: I kept thinking that I would say something silly or that they wouldn’t be interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel overwhelming. How did those thoughts make you feel at that moment, physically and emotionally?

User: I felt really anxious and just wanted to leave. My heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to say something embarrassing.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It seems like anxiety affected your ability to enjoy the gathering. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit—how likely do you think it is that someone would think negatively of you for what you say?

User: I’m not sure... it feels high when I'm in the moment. But maybe it’s not as high as I think?

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. It's common for our fears to feel more intense than they actually are. What could be an alternative way to view your contributions in social settings?

User: Maybe if I think of it as just sharing and not worrying about perfection? But that’s hard to remember.

Consultant: Absolutely, that's a helpful shift in perspective! Practicing that mindset can be beneficial. Would you be willing to try reframing your thoughts the next time you’re in a social situation?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I want to be more relaxed and just enjoy my time with others.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Let’s talk about some practical ways you could remind yourself to focus on enjoying the moment rather than feeling pressured about how you’re perceived.

User: Maybe I can make a plan before going out? Like telling myself it's okay to just be myself and have fun?

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Planning some affirmations or reminders could be very useful. What would you want to tell yourself before stepping into a social situation?

User: I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to be myself. Just having fun is what matters, not being perfect.

Consultant: I love that affirmation, D! It emphasizes self-acceptance and enjoyment. Are there specific social situations coming up where you could practice this mindset?

User: Yes, there's a study group planned for next week that I will attend. I can try out my new approach there.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great opportunity. How do you feel about attending the study group with that approach in mind?

User: I feel a little more excited about it now. It helps to think that I can just be myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Let’s also discuss a couple of techniques you could use to ease anxiety in the moment. How do you generally manage your anxiety when it arises?

User: I haven’t really done anything specific. I just try to breathe and hope it passes.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good start! We can also explore grounding techniques, like focusing on your surroundings or the people around you. Would you like to try some together?

User: Sure, I’d love that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you're at the study group. Take a moment to notice what you see around you: the colors, the sounds, and the feelings in your body. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming to think about. I can visualize the group and the warmth of my friends, which is nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful visualization, D! It can help ground you in the moment. Remember, connecting with those sensory details can help you feel more present. How do you see yourself applying this next week?

User: I’ll try to remember the calming techniques and affirmations. I think that might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I believe in you, D. Before we wrap up, how about we summarize what you've discussed today and how you feel about your progress?

User: I think I’ve identified some good strategies. It makes me feel proud that I'm working on my social skills. I’m excited to continue building my confidence.

Consultant: I’m so glad you feel that way! You’ve made significant strides. We can reinforce these strategies in our future sessions. Make sure to reflect on your experiences in the study group, and we can talk about how it went when we meet next time.

User: I will! Thank you so much for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, D. I’m looking forward to hearing how things go. Remember, you’re on a positive path. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like things have been looking up for you recently. How are you feeling about your progress and the feedback from your supervisor?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel a bit more confident. The positive feedback really helped, and I’m progressing with my thesis. But sometimes I still struggle with self-doubt, even though I know things are going well.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've received positive feedback and are moving forward with your thesis! It's normal to experience self-doubt, especially when you're in such a demanding phase of your studies. Can you share more about what triggers these feelings of doubt for you?

User: I guess it's mostly when I compare myself to others. Seeing my peers doing well makes me wonder if I'm good enough. 

Consultant: That comparison can be quite challenging and often leads to increased self-doubt. It's interesting how we can be our own harshest critics. What kind of thoughts come to your mind during those moments of comparison?

User: I usually think that they’re much smarter or more skilled than I am. It makes me feel like I’m falling behind.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are pretty powerful for you. Let's explore this a bit: how accurate do you think those thoughts are? Have you seen any evidence that backs them up, or might there be another way to view your abilities?

User: I suppose I don’t really have concrete evidence. I mean, I’ve done well in my classes and my thesis is on track. I guess I’m just being too hard on myself.

Consultant: Acknowledging your achievements is an important step! It seems there's a disconnect between your accomplishments and your self-perception. How might things change if you tried to focus more on your successes and strengths, rather than comparing yourself to others?

User: That might help. If I remind myself of what I’ve achieved, it could change how I feel. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your journey can reinforce your self-esteem. Maybe we could set a goal for you to write down a few accomplishments each week. Would that be something you could try?

User: Yes, I could definitely do that. It might help me to see my progress more clearly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. In addition to writing about your achievements, how about we also discuss some strategies to manage those moments of doubt when they arise? 

User: That would be helpful. Sometimes I just wish I could turn off those negative thoughts.

Consultant: I understand the desire to eliminate those thoughts completely, which can be tough. One helpful technique is to challenge those negative thoughts when they pop up. For example, if you think, “I’m not as capable as my peers,” you can counter it with, “I’ve made progress in my thesis and received positive feedback.” How does that approach sound to you?

User: That sounds reasonable. I can try to remind myself of the positives when the negative thoughts come.

Consultant: That’s a great approach. Remember, thoughts are not always facts, and questioning their validity can help. Now, looking forward, what personal goals do you envision for yourself in terms of both academic and emotional wellbeing?

User: I want to maintain my academic progress and develop a more positive mindset. I think having a clearer vision of what I want to achieve can help.

Consultant: That clarity can certainly guide you. We can work together on defining specific, achievable goals. How do you envision your academic success in the next few months?

User: I’d like to finish my thesis by the end of the semester and also feel more balanced in my life with some hobbies.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Balancing your academic commitments with personal interests is crucial for overall wellbeing. What hobbies are you thinking about incorporating into your life?

User: I’ve always wanted to get back into painting. It used to relax me, and I think it would be good to have that outlet again.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself and relax. Let’s make it a part of your routine. How about setting aside a specific time each week to engage in that activity?

User: That would be nice. I can start with an hour on weekends.

Consultant: Excellent! Just remember to be flexible with yourself as you incorporate these changes. Balancing academics and hobbies can take time. How do you feel about the steps we've outlined today?

User: I feel more optimistic about my situation. I believe recognizing my progress and making time for painting will help me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Reflecting on your achievements and finding joy in your interests can significantly improve your mental wellbeing. As we wrap up, let’s discuss how you can maintain this positive momentum moving forward.

User: Sure! What do you think would be the best way?

Consultant: Regularly reviewing your accomplishments and dedicating time to your hobbies will be key. Additionally, consider checking in with supportive friends or groups that share your interests. Would that be feasible for you?

User: Yes, I think connecting with others could really help me. 

Consultant: Great! Let me summarize: you’re setting goals for recognizing your achievements, re-engaging in painting, and connecting with others. These efforts can build a strong foundation for your mental health. 

User: I’m feeling good about this. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, D! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you’re equipped to navigate any challenges ahead. If you ever need support in the future, remember, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind.

Consultant: Today marks a positive step forward. I wish you all the best with your thesis and personal goals. Take care, and I hope to hear about your progress soon!
