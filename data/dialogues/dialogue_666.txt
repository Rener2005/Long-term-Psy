Consultant: Hello, Wang. I'm glad to see you today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge that it's been a challenging time for you lately. Can you share with me how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really on edge, especially after the fight with my mother-in-law. I can't shake off the hurtful things she said. I feel anxious most of the time, and it's affecting my sleep too.

Consultant: It sounds like that conflict left a significant mark on you. I can imagine how deeply hurtful those words must have been. Can you tell me more about what emotions and thoughts arise when you think about that fight?

User: I feel a mix of sadness and anger. Sometimes I think maybe I'm not a good daughter-in-law. Her words really hit me hard. I can't help but replay the argument in my mind.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when someone close to you makes hurtful comments. You mentioned feeling like you're not a good daughter-in-law. Where do you think that belief comes from?

User: I guess I always wanted to please her and be seen as good enough. When she criticized me, it felt like I failed her expectations.

Consultant: That makes sense. It seems that her words have triggered some deep feelings of inadequacy for you. Let's explore this a bit more—how do you usually react to such criticisms from her or others?

User: I tend to either get really quiet, or I might snap back without thinking. But deep down, it really bothers me. I can't stand feeling devalued like that.

Consultant: It's tough to feel devalued, especially in a family setting where we expect support. You've mentioned getting quiet or snapping back. Can we delve into how those reactions affect your overall emotional state afterward?

User: When I stay quiet, I feel even worse because I don't express what I'm really feeling. And when I snap back, I feel guilty afterward. It's like I can't win either way.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a challenging cycle: either bottling up your feelings or reacting impulsively. This must create a lot of inner tension for you. How do you think these interactions with your mother-in-law affect your anxiety overall?

User: It makes my anxiety worse. Every time there's a family gathering, I dread it. My heart races, and I feel shaky. I worry about the possibility of another conflict.

Consultant: That makes sense. The anticipation of conflict can heighten anxiety significantly. You mentioned feeling shaky and having racing thoughts. Have you been able to find any moments of calm or relief during this period?

User: Not really. I struggle to relax because I'm often thinking about what she might say or how I might react. Sleep has been really tough too; I keep tossing and turning.

Consultant: That sounds exhausting. Sleep is essential for managing stress and anxiety. Let's talk about some ways you could approach the next family gathering. How about establishing some coping strategies to help you feel more grounded?

User: I'm open to that. I just want to feel more in control and less anxious.

Consultant: Great! One approach might be to identify some grounding techniques you can use during those moments of anxiety. For instance, wouldn’t it help to take a few deep breaths before entering the gathering? 

User: That sounds like it could help. I often forget to breathe when I'm anxious.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be incredibly helpful in reducing anxiety. We can practice a simple one together, if you’d like. It’s about taking a deep breath in, holding it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhaling. Would you want to give it a try?

User: Yes, I'd like to try it now.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s do it. Take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now slowly exhale through your mouth. How do you feel after doing that?

User: I felt a bit more relaxed, actually. It’s nice to have something simple to focus on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Practicing this technique can help you regain a sense of control in stressful situations. In addition to that, would you be open to exploring how to reframe your thoughts regarding your mother-in-law's criticisms?

User: I think that would be helpful. I always take her words personally, but I know I shouldn't.

Consultant: Let's consider this: What if her comments say more about her than they do about you? It's common for people to project their insecurities onto others. What do you think about that perspective?

User: That makes sense. Maybe it's her way of dealing with her own issues, but it's still hard to not take it to heart.

Consultant: It’s definitely a challenging perspective to adopt, but recognizing that her words are reflective of her struggles could help lessen their impact on you. When you think about the criticisms, try to remember that you are worthy of love and respect regardless of anyone's opinion.

User: I'll try to keep that in mind. It’s just difficult in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It takes practice, and it’s okay. We can also discuss how to prepare yourself when you anticipate those critical comments. Would it help to have some affirmations to remind you of your worth?

User: Yes, affirmations could be a good idea. I need a reminder that I'm enough.

Consultant: How about starting with a simple affirmation like, "I am worthy of love and respect”? You can repeat this to yourself when you're feeling anxious or during family gatherings. 

User: I like that. I’ll definitely try repeating that to myself.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it's all about gentle reminders and building resilience. You've already taken significant steps by being here today. We will continue to work together to strengthen these strategies. How are you feeling about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It's good to talk about these things and have practical strategies to use.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way. As we continue our journey together, let's focus on these coping techniques and reframing strategies. You're doing great, Wang, and I believe you can overcome this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your encouragement.

Consultant: You're very welcome. Keep practicing those techniques, and don't hesitate to reach out when you need support. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work on it together.

User: I will. Thank you so much for your help today!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. I remember from our last session that you've been feeling anxious due to family conflicts. How have you been since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Honestly, not much has changed. I'm still feeling quite anxious, especially about the tensions with my mother-in-law. It seems to affect my work performance too, and I worry that I might mess things up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders. You're concerned about your family relationships and how they translate into your work life. Could you share more about how these feelings have been manifesting in your daily routine or at work?

User: Well, at work, I find it tough to concentrate on my tasks. I'm constantly worried about making mistakes, and when I do mess up, even a little, I end up being really hard on myself. It feels like I can't afford any mistakes right now.

Consultant: I hear you. The pressure you're feeling to perform perfectly is intensifying your anxiety. Let’s take a step back for a moment. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you make a mistake at work?

User: I usually think, "I'm not good enough" or "I’m going to disappoint everyone." It just spirals into a really negative mindset, and I can't shake it off.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite powerful. They seem to magnify your feelings of inadequacy. Let’s explore this a bit. How strong do you believe those thoughts are, and is there any evidence that supports or contradicts them?

User: I often feel like everyone expects me to be perfect, but when I look around, I see that others make mistakes too. I guess it's not logical to think I have to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly, recognizing that you're not alone in making mistakes is a crucial step. If a friend shared similar feelings, what would you tell her about those thoughts? 

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to make mistakes, and nobody is perfect. I tell myself that sometimes, but it’s hard to believe it for myself.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective to have for a friend. Now, let's see if we can practice that self-compassion for you. Instead of saying "I'm not good enough," what would be a more balanced thought you could have?

User: Maybe something like, "I did my best and it'll be okay to learn from mistakes." 

Consultant: Yes, that sounds much healthier! Shifting to acknowledging your efforts rather than strictly focusing on perfection can be quite beneficial. Let’s role-play a scenario at work where you make a minor mistake. How might you respond to yourself in that moment with this new thought?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself: "It's just a mistake. What can I learn from this instead of beating myself up?"

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! You’re actively choosing to respond with curiosity rather than judgment. How do you think this shift might affect your overall mental state?

User: I think it could help me feel more at ease and less anxious. I hope I would be able to focus better at work.

Consultant: Absolutely, that awareness can reduce anxiety significantly and improve your focus. Let’s also introduce mindfulness exercises to help ground you during moments of intense emotion. Have you ever tried any mindfulness techniques before?

User: I haven’t really done any mindfulness practices, but I’m open to trying if it might help.

Consultant: Great! Mindfulness can be as simple as taking a few moments to focus on your breath when you feel overwhelmed. Would you like to try a brief exercise together now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on how your breath feels as it moves in and out. This can be a grounding tool when you’re feeling anxious. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming. I didn’t realize just focusing on my breath could make a difference.

Consultant: It can be quite powerful! Regular practice can significantly increase your emotional resilience. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and how you can apply this in your life moving forward.

User: We talked about recognizing my negative thoughts and shifting to more balanced ones. We also practiced some mindfulness techniques.

Consultant: That’s right! What specific strategies do you think you’ll try to implement between now and our next session?

User: I will practice the breathing exercises, and I’ll try to remind myself it's okay to make mistakes. I want to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Remember, it’s a journey towards self-compassion and emotional regulation. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter already thinking about these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration. I keep making small mistakes at work, and it’s really getting to me. I can't shake off the feeling of self-blame. 

Consultant: I hear you. It can be really tough when those small mistakes have such a big emotional impact. Can you share a specific situation from work that you feel particularly upset about? 

User: Just yesterday, I missed a small detail in a financial report. It wasn't a huge mistake, but I ruminated on it for hours afterward, thinking about what others would think of me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable that you'd feel so affected by it. What kind of thoughts were going through your mind when you realized you made that mistake? 

User: I kept thinking that I should be more careful. I worried that my boss would question my abilities. It felt like I was letting everyone down.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really amplify the anxiety. It sounds like you're being quite hard on yourself. If you could take a step back, how would you assess those thoughts? Are they completely fair? 

User: I guess they feel fair in the moment, but logically, I know that everyone makes mistakes. I just can’t seem to shake off the emotional weight. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way, especially when in a high-pressure environment. Let's try to analyze that thought process a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts about your abilities? 

User: Well, I have received positive feedback in the past, and my colleagues have made mistakes too. But when I mess up, it feels like it’s all I can focus on.

Consultant: So, there is evidence that challenges those negative thoughts. How can we remind yourself of that when you find yourself spiraling into self-blame, especially after a mistake? 

User: I could try to write down some of the positive feedback I've received. Maybe if I read it when I start feeling bad, it will help. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Keeping a record of positive feedback can serve as a tangible reminder of your capabilities. Would you be willing to try that before our next session? 

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I also want to learn how to manage my anxiety better when I make mistakes.

Consultant: Perfect. Acknowledging your anxiety is the first step. Let’s also explore some mindfulness techniques to help ground you in those moments. Have you ever practiced mindfulness or breathing exercises before? 

User: I’ve heard about it, but I haven’t really tried it. I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: No problem at all! Mindfulness is about being present in the moment without judgment. We can start with a simple breathing exercise together right now, if you’d like?

User: That sounds good. I’m open to trying. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four seconds, hold it for four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for six. How does that feel? 

User: I feel a little lighter. It’s nice to just focus on my breath for a moment.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing this for a few minutes each day can help anchor your thoughts when anxiety hits again. Would you be willing to incorporate this into your daily routine?

User: Yes, I think I can set aside a few minutes each day for this. 

Consultant: Excellent! As you begin practicing, it’s also helpful to remember that the goal is not to eliminate anxiety entirely but to learn to manage it better. How do you feel about that approach? 

User: It makes sense. Instead of fighting my emotions, perhaps I can learn to deal with them in a healthier way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that these feelings are part of being human is key. You’re doing great by just being here and trying to work through these feelings. Is there anything else that’s been on your mind lately regarding work or your overall well-being? 

User: I just hope I can be more forgiving of myself. I want to stop the cycle of self-criticism.

Consultant: That’s a significant goal! It involves practicing self-compassion. Maybe after identifying a mistake, you could ask yourself how you would talk to a friend in the same situation. What do you think about that? 

User: I would definitely be kinder to a friend! I could try to apply that same kindness to myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful strategy! It’s about shifting that negative inner dialogue to a more supportive one. Let’s summarize what you’d like to work on before our next session. 

User: I’ll keep a record of positive feedback, practice breathing exercises daily, and try to be kinder to myself after mistakes.

Consultant: Those are all excellent strategies! Together, they should help you build resilience and gradually shift your self-talk. How are you feeling about our session today? 

User: I feel more hopeful. Having actionable strategies makes me feel better. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and you're making progress. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support today.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care and see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've had a bit of a mix lately. I've been trying to apply the mindfulness techniques we discussed, and I think they’ve helped somewhat. However, when I'm alone, I still find myself constantly ruminating about my mother-in-law's words.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been working on the mindfulness techniques! It’s common to have lingering thoughts, especially in sensitive situations. Can you share what specific thoughts about your mother-in-law come to mind when you're alone?

User: Yes, I keep replaying our conversations in my head, particularly when she criticizes me. I feel hurt and can’t help but think about what she said.

Consultant: I can understand how those words can stay with you and affect your emotions. When you think about those criticisms, what feelings arise in you?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes a bit angry, as if I’m not good enough. It's frustrating because I know I shouldn’t dwell on it, but it just keeps coming back.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a conflict between your logical understanding and your emotional response. Let’s explore those feelings further. Can we identify any negative thoughts that arise during those moments?

User: I often think, "She must think I'm a terrible mother," or "I’ll never meet her expectations." These thoughts make me feel terrible.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh and definitely understandable. How do you think these thoughts impact your overall sense of self-worth or your behavior around her?

User: They make me withdraw a bit. I feel shy and hesitate to engage with her, fearing more criticism.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to protect yourself from further pain. However, let's challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re a terrible mother or that you can’t meet her expectations?

User: Well, my kids are happy and healthy... and my husband often tells me I’m doing a great job. I know deep down that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: That's important evidence! It seems like you do have a lot to be proud of. If a friend were in a similar situation, how would you encourage her to view these thoughts?

User: I would probably tell her to focus on the positive and remind her that no one is perfect. Everyone has their flaws.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective for others. Now, let’s see how we can apply that same kindness to yourself. When you think about your mother-in-law’s comments, could you reframe them into a more balanced view?

User: Maybe I could think, "She has her own opinions, but they don’t define who I am as a mother."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframing! This way, you can separate her criticism from your self-worth. How would it feel to actively remind yourself of this when those negative thoughts arise?

User: It might help to alleviate some of the anxiety. I’ll definitely try it.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s discuss the mindfulness practice you’ve been doing. How has that been going for you in terms of managing these thoughts and feelings?

User: I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness regularly, focusing on my breath. I feel more grounded afterward, but the thoughts still creep in sometimes.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're finding some grounding in mindfulness. Remember, it’s normal for thoughts to arise even during practice. What if we added some visualization or specific meditation focusing on self-compassion to your routine?

User: That sounds helpful! I think visualizing myself embracing my flaws would be beneficial.

Consultant: Absolutely, visualization can be a powerful tool. Let’s create a simple exercise for you: imagine a warm light enveloping you while you breathe, representing your strengths and embracing your imperfections. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. It sounds comforting. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s commit to this exercise daily and see how it makes a difference in shifting your perspective. We can check in on your progress next time. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I’m feeling optimistic about it. It feels like a positive step.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. You’ve worked hard to incorporate mindfulness, and it’s helping you manage your emotions. What are your thoughts on how to maintain this momentum?

User: I think I need to remind myself to be kind to myself and keep practicing the techniques we discussed. I want to avoid slipping back into those negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Establishing a routine around your mindfulness practice can be very helpful. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You are doing great, Wang!

User: Thank you for your support. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! If you find yourself facing challenges between sessions, keep in mind you can always return to these techniques. I'm proud of your efforts, and I look forward to our next meeting. Take care!

User: I will! Thank you, see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. It's good to hear that you've been feeling more emotionally stable and have improved your relationship with your mother-in-law. Can you share how you've been applying the techniques you've learned in your family interactions?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been trying to use the mindfulness techniques to stay calm during stressful moments. It has helped a bit, but I still find myself getting upset when my husband and I argue about certain topics, like finances or the children's education.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress, but there are still situations that trigger your emotions. Let's focus on those arguments. When these discussions arise, what thoughts or feelings come to your mind?

User: During arguments, I often feel that I'm not being heard, and I get frustrated. Sometimes I think that my husband doesn’t see things as seriously as I do, which makes me feel more anxious.

Consultant: I hear you—feeling unheard can be really frustrating. It seems like you worry that he might not understand the importance of the issues you're discussing. Could you describe what thoughts specifically go through your mind in those moments?

User: I usually think that if he doesn't agree with me, it means he doesn’t care about our family’s future. That thought makes me anxious and causes me to raise my voice.

Consultant: That’s a strong thought, and I can see how it would heighten your anxiety. Let’s challenge that thought together. Is there any evidence that your husband doesn’t care about your family’s future, or could there be other explanations for his perspective?

User: I guess he does care; he just has a different way of handling things. But when I’m upset, it’s hard to remember that.

Consultant: It’s understandable to lose sight of that when emotions run high. What if, during these discussions, you tried reminding yourself of his intentions before reacting? How might that change your response?

User: That could help me stay calmer. I might approach the conversation more positively instead of jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! How about we practice a potential dialogue for one of these conflicts? Maybe we can work through how you might express your concerns without feeling overwhelmed.

User: Sure! That might be useful. Let’s say I want to talk about our budget. I always feel tense bringing it up, especially if he seems distracted.

Consultant: Okay, let’s role-play that. You can start the conversation, and I’ll respond as your husband. Remember, keep your focus on expressing your feelings without making accusations.

User: Alright. “I’d like to discuss the budget if you have a moment. I feel a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think we need to plan better.”

Consultant: “I hear you, but I’ve been really busy with work. Can we do this later?” 

User: I might respond with, “I understand you're busy, but I need to talk about it now because it’s causing me anxiety. Can we set aside 10 minutes to go through it?”

Consultant: That’s a solid response! You assert your need while acknowledging his situation. How do you feel about expressing yourself that way?

User: I feel empowered! It sounds clear and respectful. 

Consultant: It's wonderful that you're feeling empowered! Let's remember that feeling when you face those discussions. What can you do if you notice your emotions starting to surge during these moments?

User: I can take a deep breath and use the mindfulness techniques to calm myself before responding. 

Consultant: Excellent approach! It sounds like you’re really grasping the techniques. Let's also talk about potential challenges you foresee in maintaining this positive communication style. 

User: I worry that when tensions rise, I might forget what we talked about and revert to old habits.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Could we brainstorm a few reminders or cues that you could use during these conversations to help you stay on track?

User: Maybe I can have a small note nearby with key phrases to remind me to stay calm and focused. 

Consultant: That sounds effective! A visual cue can help trigger your positive mindset. How about the next steps? 

User: I’ll create that note and practice the dialogue we just had with my husband. I hope it will go well!

Consultant: I believe in your ability to communicate effectively! Before we conclude today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and practiced. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can assert my feelings without escalating conflicts. Also, practicing mindfulness in those moments really helps.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway! Understanding how to communicate your feelings calmly and effectively is crucial. Finally, as we move forward, what strategies will you employ if you find yourself slipping back into old habits?

User: I’ll remind myself why I need to stay calm and refer to my note. And I can practice these exercises regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You’re making great progress in your emotional management, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re capable of handling these challenges. 

User: Thank you for your support! I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat better, but there are still moments when I feel anxious, especially when I think about potential conflicts with my family.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've experienced some improvement. Reflecting on those moments of anxiety, what specific thoughts are triggering those feelings for you?

User: I often worry that my family won't understand my perspective, and that our discussions could turn into arguments. I really want to maintain a peaceful environment.

Consultant: That desire for harmony is quite understandable. Can you pinpoint some thoughts you have when you anticipate those discussions? How do they make you feel in the moment?

User: I find myself thinking, "What if they don’t listen to me?" or "What if I can't express myself clearly?" These thoughts usually make me feel tense and overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite stressful. Let's explore them a bit deeper. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that your family wouldn't listen to you?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, they do listen, but I just fear the worst.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation. It's common to hold onto those worst-case scenarios. If a close friend was in your shoes, how might you advise her to view those conversations?

User: I would probably tell her to be patient and express her thoughts clearly. I would encourage her to remember that her family cares about her.

Consultant: Exactly. It sounds like you have a realistic and compassionate perspective when considering your friend's situation. Let's try applying that same mindset to your circumstances. What alternative thoughts could you challenge yourself with before these discussions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that my family cares for me and that they want to understand my point of view. I could also tell myself it’s okay to take my time explaining.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent alternative thoughts that can help alleviate your anxiety. Have you had the chance to practice any of these strategies before those discussions?

User: I’ve tried a few times, and it does help to remind myself of those alternative thoughts. However, I still find it challenging to implement them consistently.

Consultant: Consistency takes time, and it's completely normal to face some difficulties. Let’s work on creating a small action plan. What are some specific situations you can foresee coming up in discussions with your family where you could apply these new strategies?

User: Well, we have a family dinner coming up next week, and that usually leads to conversations about our future plans, which can get a bit tense.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! You could prepare yourself by taking a moment beforehand to remind yourself to use those alternative thoughts. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I think I’ll also write down those thoughts to keep them in mind during the dinner.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Writing them down can serve as a great reminder. Before we wrap up today, let’s revisit how we can maintain this emotional handling strategy in the long run. How would you like to implement this consistently in your daily life?

User: I think setting aside a few minutes each day to reflect on my thoughts and potential conversations would help me stay prepared. 

Consultant: Excellent plan, Wang! You’re setting up a proactive approach. Remember to also reach out to your support system, like your husband, when you feel challenged. How are you feeling about all this now?

User: I feel more empowered. I’m grateful for the strategies we’ve discussed, and I believe I can apply them during the family dinner.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear you feel empowered! You've made significant progress here. For our next session, I’d love to hear how that dinner goes and if any adjustments are needed. Remember, I'm here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences in our next meeting.

Consultant: You're welcome, Wang! Just remember, you're not alone in this journey. I'm excited for our next session together. Until then, take care and practice those strategies. Goodbye for now!
