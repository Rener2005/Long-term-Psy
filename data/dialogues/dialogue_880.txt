Consultant: Hello, Zhao. I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down and anxious. I can't shake the feeling of dread whenever I think about speaking in class. It makes me question my abilities and I feel like I'm falling behind.

Consultant: It sounds like speaking in class is a significant source of anxiety for you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you think about doing it?

User: I just feel this overwhelming panic like I'm going to embarrass myself. I remember being bullied in middle school, and those memories flood back.

Consultant: That must be really tough for you. It seems like those past experiences are affecting how you see yourself now, especially in a classroom setting. What kind of thoughts go through your mind in those moments of panic?

User: I think things like "I can't do this," or "I'll look stupid." It's like my mind is just racing with all the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very challenging. When you think “I can’t do this,” how does that affect your emotions and actions?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and hopeless. I just freeze up and avoid speaking altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like this cycle of negative thinking is contributing to your anxiety and avoidance. Have you noticed if these thoughts are extreme or one-sided? 

User: Yeah, they definitely feel one-sided. I never think about how I might do well or that my classmates might actually be supportive.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Zhao. Let’s explore this further. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to think differently about speaking in class?

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate view. Now, let’s try to apply that same perspective to your situation. What would it look like for you to shift your self-talk to something more encouraging when facing these speaking situations?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to mess up and that everyone else is learning too.

Consultant: That’s a great reframe! Allowing yourself to be human and acknowledging that mistakes are part of learning can really help reduce that pressure. What small steps do you think you could take to practice this new mindset?

User: Maybe I could start by answering questions in smaller group settings first before addressing the whole class.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable! Gradually exposing yourself to speaking situations can help build your confidence. What other activities could support your learning in a less stressful environment?

User: I could practice with friends outside of class to get more comfortable speaking up.

Consultant: Practicing in a safe space with friends is an excellent strategy. Would you be open to setting specific times to do this?

User: Yes, I think that would really help. 

Consultant: Let’s also think about the feelings you experience when preparing to speak. How about creating a calming routine before class to help ease your anxiety?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could try deep breathing or listen to some music to calm down. 

Consultant: Deep breathing and music can be excellent ways to reduce anxiety. Incorporating these techniques before you speak may help improve your confidence. How do you feel about trying these strategies?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It's nice to talk about this and have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you implement these strategies, remember that progress may take time. What will you focus on as your first step when we meet again?

User: I’ll focus on practicing with my friends and trying to speak up in smaller groups first.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhao. Let’s summarize what you've learned today. You identified some negative thoughts and created a more supportive internal dialogue. You're also opening up to taking small steps to conquer your fears. 

User: Yes, I think I understand how important it is to challenge those negative beliefs.

Consultant: Indeed! As you continue to challenge those thoughts and take action, you’ll likely see improvements in your confidence and your feelings about speaking. How are you feeling now about the upcoming classes?

User: I still feel nervous, but I also feel more equipped to handle it. 

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Recognizing your progress is essential. For next time, let’s check in on how these strategies are working for you. 

User: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s all about taking those small steps. I’m here to support you through this journey. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thanks! I'm looking forward to it too.

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty low. I still can't shake off the disappointment about failing two courses last semester. It's making me feel like I just can't do anything right.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like the results have really affected your confidence and how you see your abilities. Can you share more about what thoughts come to mind when you think about those failures?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not cut out for this. Like, I shouldn't be in college if I can’t handle it. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand why you feel frustrated. It sounds like those thoughts are weighing heavily on you. When you say you feel like you shouldn’t be in college, what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and almost hopeless. Like I don't belong. I dread the idea of failing again.

Consultant: That sense of hopelessness must be very difficult to deal with. Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. When you think about failing again, what specific fears come to your mind?

User: I fear that I might embarrass myself, especially in front of my classmates. I just don’t want to let anyone down again.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. We all have a desire to avoid embarrassment. But I wonder, what evidence do you have that failing will definitely happen again? Are there any other outcomes you might consider?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. I just... I feel like it’s inevitable because I didn’t do well last time.

Consultant: It seems like you're in a cycle where past experiences are leading to predictions about the future. Let's try to challenge this thinking. What if you look at your past performance differently? Can you think of instances where you did succeed or improve?

User: Well, in the past, I did manage to get decent grades in other courses. I also passed my midterms last year.

Consultant: That's a great realization! You have had some successes too. How can remembering those accomplishments change how you view your ability to succeed moving forward?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful, I guess. Like maybe I can turn things around if I try hard enough.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift in your thinking! It's important to acknowledge your past successes. Let's explore some strategies you could use to feel more capable and prepared moving forward. Have you thought about how you could approach your studies differently this time?

User: I suppose I could create a better study schedule. I also should probably seek help from classmates or my professors if I don’t understand something.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating a study schedule can help you manage your time better, and reaching out for support is a strong step towards success. How do you feel about implementing these changes?

User: It feels a bit daunting, honestly. What if I still struggle?

Consultant: It's okay to feel apprehensive. Remember, facing challenges is part of the learning process. What if we came up with some manageable steps to ease that pressure? Perhaps setting smaller goals for yourself?

User: That could help. Maybe I can focus on one subject at a time instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking things down into smaller tasks can make them feel more achievable and less overwhelming. How do you think you would handle setbacks along the way, using what we've discussed?

User: I guess it’s about reminding myself of my past successes and not being too hard on myself. I need to treat myself with more kindness.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Self-compassion can be very powerful. Let’s also think about how you can prepare for those public speaking scenarios you mentioned feeling anxious about. What steps might you take to feel more comfortable?

User: Maybe I can practice in front of a mirror or with some friends. Just to get used to speaking in front of others.

Consultant: Practicing is a fantastic idea! It gives you a chance to build confidence in a safe environment. Have you tried anything like that before?

User: No, I’ve always just avoided it. But I think I could try.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you’re willing to give it a shot! It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it can gradually help reduce the anxiety you experience. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels a little more manageable. I just hope I can stick with it.

Consultant: Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You can take this one step at a time. What's one thing you'll commit to practicing before our next session?

User: I’ll try to practice speaking while looking in the mirror at least three times this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid commitment! I’m really proud of you for taking this step, Zhao. Let’s reflect on the progress you've made today. What are your biggest takeaways?

User: I feel more optimistic about my abilities and the importance of practicing. I realize that I can’t let my past define my future.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! You’ve really started to challenge those negative beliefs. I’m excited to see how this will help you grow. As we wrap up today, remember that setbacks are part of the process. You have strategies to cope and support available to you.

User: Thank you, this session really helped. I feel more ready to face challenges now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! If you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I've been pretty anxious, to be honest. After that academic discussion at school, I can't stop worrying about public speaking. I keep replaying my mistakes in my head.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite distressing for you. You mentioned feeling anxious about public speaking and worrying about your mistakes. Could you tell me more about what specifically triggers that anxiety for you?

User: I just hate the idea of freezing up or stumbling over my words in front of everyone. It makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed.

Consultant: I understand. The fear of embarrassment can be very overwhelming. Let's explore this further. What thoughts do you have in those moments when you feel the pressure to speak in public?

User: I often think that everyone will judge me harshly if I make a mistake. It's like I can already hear their criticism in my head, which makes me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: That's tough, Zhao. It seems like you’re anticipating negative judgment from others. Let's try to unpack that a bit. How valid do you think those thoughts are? Do you think everyone in the audience is really focused solely on your performance?

User: I guess I logically know that people are more focused on themselves and their own concerns. But in the moment, it just feels so real to me.

Consultant: It’s quite common to feel that way. Sometimes our emotions can cloud our reasoning. Could we try to challenge those negative thoughts together? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their fears?

User: I would probably tell them that nobody is perfect and that mistakes are part of learning. But when it’s me up there, I just don’t apply that logic.

Consultant: Exactly! You're recognizing that the pressure you feel isn't entirely fair. Let’s take a moment to think about how you can shift that perspective. What about trying to reframe that critical voice? What could be a more supportive thought to replace it with?

User: Maybe something like, "It’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone has been there, and I can learn from this experience"?

Consultant: That’s a great start! By affirming that mistakes are part of the learning process, you’ll be able to ease your anxiety. Now, let’s think about some practical strategies. Have you considered practicing your public speaking in a lower-pressure environment before facing a larger audience?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. I usually avoid speaking altogether to prevent embarrassing moments.

Consultant: I understand the urge to avoid it. However, gradual exposure could help you build confidence. How about starting by practicing in front of a friend or even a mirror? 

User: That sounds manageable. I could try speaking about a topic I'm comfortable with first.

Consultant: That's perfect! Starting with something familiar can build your confidence over time. What other strategies do you think might help with your anxiety in these situations?

User: I read that deep breathing can help. Maybe I could try some relaxation techniques before speaking.

Consultant: Absolutely! Incorporating deep breathing exercises can be very effective. Would you like to set a goal for practicing both the speech and the relaxation techniques before our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would help me stay accountable and give me something to work towards.

Consultant: Great! So, to summarize, you aim to practice your public speaking in a safe space while incorporating deep breathing techniques. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. As you work on these strategies, what do you feel will be the biggest challenge for you?

User: Probably just overcoming the initial fear of even starting to speak in front of someone.

Consultant: That’s totally normal. Perhaps we can visualize a scenario where you are speaking and a friend is nodding in support. This might make it feel less daunting. 

User: That’s a helpful visualization! I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to face this challenge, Zhao. It’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s continue to build on your skills and confidence in our next session. What do you hope to gain from our time together moving forward?

User: I want to feel more comfortable interacting in social situations and speaking up in class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Developing those social skills can make a big difference. We can introduce some practice scenarios to help you gradually feel more at ease. 

User: That would be great! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Of course! It's important to take this journey together. I’m proud of the willingness you’ve shown today to tackle these challenges. Just remember, you’re not alone in this process.

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated to tackle my fears now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing, and we'll touch base on your progress in our next session. You’ve got this, Zhao! 

User: Thanks! I’ll definitely work on it. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Zhao! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you could join me for this session today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been reflecting a lot on my recent experiences in group counseling. I noticed how some classmates communicate so easily, while I often struggle. It's made me realize how much I want to improve my social skills.

Consultant: It's great that you’re recognizing that desire to improve. Can you share more about what specific challenges you face when it comes to social interactions?

User: I often feel anxious when speaking in groups. I worry about saying the wrong thing or not being understood, which just makes me more quiet.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Zhao. It sounds like that anxiety is holding you back from expressing yourself. What would it look like for you to feel more confident in those situations?

User: I imagine being able to join conversations without overthinking every word. I’d like to feel relaxed and just go with the flow during group discussions.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal! Let's explore some strategies to help you build that confidence. Have you tried any techniques or practices to improve your social skills so far?

User: Not really. I haven’t known exactly where to start. I just feel lost when I think about it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Getting started can be challenging. How about we try some role-playing exercises in our sessions to simulate conversations? It could help you practice and feel more at ease.

User: That sounds helpful! Practicing might make it less intimidating when I have to do it for real.

Consultant: Exactly! Role-playing can provide a safe space for you to experiment with what you want to say without any pressure. What kind of social situations do you find most difficult to navigate?

User: I think group discussions in class are tough for me. I want to participate but often just end up listening instead.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. Let’s start our role-play by simulating a group discussion. You can take the role of a participant, and I’ll act as a peer. We’ll create a scenario where you can practice sharing your thoughts. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! It’ll be a good way for me to practice speaking up.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine it's a discussion about a recent class project. You can share your thoughts on a specific aspect of the project. What would you like to say?

User: Okay, I think I would want to talk about the research part we did. I found it interesting that different sources had varying opinions.

Consultant: That’s a solid point to bring up! Now, let’s practice how you might introduce that idea to the group. You could start by saying, “I found the research aspect really intriguing because…”

User: "I found the research aspect really intriguing because different sources had varying opinions." 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s an excellent start. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt a bit nerve-wracking, but less so knowing it was just practice.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Zhao! With more practice, it’ll become easier. Remember, everyone is likely focused on their own anxieties too. Would you be open to implementing this practice between our sessions?

User: Yeah, I can definitely try that. I’ll think of topics to discuss with friends or even practice in front of a mirror.

Consultant: Fantastic! By actively engaging in conversations or even practicing in front of the mirror, you’ll gradually build your confidence. After trying this, we can discuss what worked or what felt challenging in our next session.

User: I will. It feels encouraging to have a plan to work on. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about taking small steps. Before we finish today, is there anything else you want to address or clarify?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I appreciate your guidance on this!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited to see how your practice goes. Next time, we can review your experiences and refine our strategies further. Remember, progress may take time, but every effort counts. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Thank you, Zhao! I believe in your ability to improve and feel more confident. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. 

User: I will! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good. Participating in group discussions has really boosted my confidence. I’m looking forward to improving my communication skills even more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re feeling more positive about interacting with your classmates. Can you share a bit more about what experiences contributed to this confidence boost?

User: Well, during our last group project, I shared my ideas openly, and my classmates were really supportive. It felt great to be heard and valued.

Consultant: It sounds like a great experience. Feeling valued and heard can really enhance your confidence. What specific aspects of your communication do you think you would like to improve further?

User: I think I need to work on speaking up more when I have ideas, especially when I’m nervous. Sometimes I hold back, fearing my thoughts might not be good enough.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It’s common to feel that way. Let’s explore how we can help you feel more comfortable sharing your ideas, especially in moments of nervousness. What are some thoughts that come to mind when you hesitate to speak?

User: I often think that maybe my ideas are not great or that I might embarrass myself. 

Consultant: Those are definitely challenging thoughts to deal with. Can we challenge those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that your ideas aren't good enough?

User: Honestly, my classmates have always been encouraging. They’ve praised my contributions in the past, so I guess I’m being too harsh on myself.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a disconnect between the feedback you receive and the thoughts you have. It’s essential to recognize and validate the positive feedback as a reality. How can you remind yourself of that when you start feeling nervous?

User: Maybe I could keep a note of the positive feedback from my classmates to look at when I’m nervous. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Having a tangible reminder can help solidify those positive thoughts. Let's practice a role-play scenario where you express an idea in a group setting. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I usually feel nervous before speaking up, so practicing might ease some of that anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s imagine you’re in that group setting. How would you introduce your idea? 

User: I’d probably start by saying, “I have an idea I’d like to share, and I hope it can contribute to our project.” 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! You’re establishing an open tone. Now, can you add how you personally feel about your idea or its potential value to the project? 

User: I could say something like, “I believe this could help us focus on our main goals.” 

Consultant: Perfect! You not only present your idea but also provide its significance. How does saying this out loud make you feel?

User: I feel a bit better saying it out loud, but I still worry a bit about how they might react.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way. Remember, you can't control how others react, but you can control how you present yourself. Focus on your delivery and the value you’re contributing. What might help ease those worries about their reaction?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that positive feedback is much more frequent than negative responses from my peers. 

Consultant: That’s a productive approach! Incorporating reminders of previous positive feedback can make a significant difference. Are there other areas in your life where you'd like to enhance communication skills as well?

User: Yes, I think I could work on my communication during presentations as well. 

Consultant: Presentations can be daunting. Would you like to discuss some strategies for managing anxiety during those situations?

User: Yes! I often get really anxious before and during presentations, and I wish I could be more composed.

Consultant: One technique could be to practice deep breathing or visualization before you start presenting. Imagining a positive outcome can set a conducive mental state for your presentation. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Definitely, that might help me feel calmer before I start talking.

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice a brief visualization now. Take a moment to close your eyes and imagine yourself successfully delivering a presentation, feeling confident and engaged. What do you see?

User: I see myself speaking clearly, and my classmates nodding in agreement. It feels really nice!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! This positive imagery can indeed work wonders. How will you incorporate this practice into your routine before presentations?

User: I’ll try to take a few moments to visualize before each presentation, along with deep breathing.

Consultant: Excellent plan! It’s about building a routine that suits you. Now, let’s take a moment to reflect on your improvement and track your progress since our sessions started. What do you feel has changed most for you?

User: I feel way more open to participating in discussions, and my fear of speaking up is definitely less than before.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Zhao! Remember, the journey to comfort in communication takes time. What strategies will you use to maintain your progress?

User: I’ll keep practicing what we discussed, and I’ll remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! You’re really taking charge of your communication journey. Do you feel ready to tackle your next group activities with this newfound confidence?

User: Yes, I’m feeling more prepared and optimistic about participating. Thank you for helping me!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to make these changes and continue growing. As we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we covered everything! I feel much better about moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you have skills and strategies that can help you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. All the best, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you for this follow-up session. How have you been feeling since our last talk? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I’ve been more active in social activities, and it's been nice to express my thoughts more freely. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress in your social interactions. Can you share a specific example of a recent situation where you felt more confident while communicating?

User: Sure! Just last week, I participated in a group discussion for a class project. I was able to share my ideas without feeling overly anxious, and I even contributed my opinions more than before. 

Consultant: That sounds like a big achievement! It’s impressive that you could express your thoughts in that setting. How did it feel to you during and after the discussion?

User: It felt really liberating! I was nervous at first, but then I found that I was enjoying the conversation. Afterward, I felt proud of myself for speaking up.

Consultant: It’s amazing to hear about that feeling of liberation and pride. Let’s explore that further—what thoughts went through your mind before and during the discussion that helped you overcome that initial nervousness?

User: Before the discussion, I reminded myself that everyone was there to learn and share ideas, just like me. During the conversation, I focused on my points rather than worrying about what others thought. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Reminding yourself that everyone is in a similar situation can really help shift your focus. It also sounds like you’re starting to challenge your negative thoughts. Would you say that’s accurate?

User: Yes, exactly! I think I’ve been learning to manage my thoughts better. I am trying to see the situation more realistically instead of assuming the worst.

Consultant: That’s a significant step in your development. By challenging those negative thoughts, you’re creating a healthier mindset. How has this shift affected your feelings about participating in future social activities?

User: I feel much more optimistic about them now. I look forward to engaging in more discussions and getting involved in school events. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Being excited for future interactions signals that you’re truly making progress. Let’s talk about your goals moving forward. Are there specific skills or areas you’d like to further develop in your social interactions?

User: I think I want to work on approaching new people and starting conversations. It still feels a bit intimidating at times.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge, and it’s great that you recognize it. We can develop some strategies together to help ease that intimidation. Perhaps we could role-play some introductory conversations to build your confidence?

User: That sounds like a good idea! Practicing might make it feel more natural. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's start with some scenarios where you might meet new people. Imagine you’re at a campus event—what would you say to someone to introduce yourself?

User: I guess I could start with something simple, like saying, “Hi, I'm Zhao. How are you enjoying the event?”

Consultant: That’s a perfect way to initiate a conversation! It shows openness and invites them to share their thoughts. How do you feel about using that opener in a real situation?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also think it’s straightforward enough that I could manage it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember that practice will help reduce that anxiety. We can also think about preparing a few follow-up questions to keep the conversation going. Would you find that helpful?

User: Yes, definitely! What would some good follow-up questions look like?

Consultant: Great question! You could ask, “What brought you to this event?” or “Have you been to similar events before?” These questions can help keep the dialogue flowing and show your interest in the person you’re speaking with.

User: Those are great suggestions! I like that they allow me to learn more about the other person, too.

Consultant: Exactly! That dual benefit of learning about others while sharing about yourself can make conversations more enjoyable. How do you feel now about your ability to initiate conversations in the future?

User: Honestly, I feel more empowered. If I can keep practicing these skills and strategies, I believe I can get better at it. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Zhao! It sounds like you’re in a good place to continue developing your social skills. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and the strategies we discussed.

User: Okay! So, I’ve improved my confidence in discussions, learned to challenge negative thoughts, and developed some strategies for starting conversations.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a clear roadmap moving forward. Remember, consistency is key—keep practicing these skills and be gentle with yourself. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate this session and all the support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you’ve come a long way, and you have the tools you need for continued growth. If you need help in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will, thank you again! I feel excited to keep improving. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Enjoy your journey ahead, Zhao. Take care!
