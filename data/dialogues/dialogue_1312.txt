Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty anxious, especially around my classmates. I really struggle to make friends, and I think my past family situation has a lot to do with it.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling pressure from your past experiences and it affects your interactions with others now. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're trying to connect with your classmates?

User: Whenever I try to talk to someone, I feel this awful tightness in my chest. I worry that they will judge me because I think my social skills are weak. 

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of worrying about how others perceive you, which adds to your anxiety. What specific thoughts go through your mind in these moments?

User: I often think that they will just see me as the awkward guy who doesn’t fit in, and I just freeze up. It makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. You mentioned feeling like you might be seen as "awkward." How true do you think that statement is? Do you have any evidence to support it?

User: I guess it feels true when I struggle to get a conversation going. But I also realize that I haven't really given them a chance to see me for who I am.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Zhao. So, while you perceive yourself as "awkward," there may be more to you than just that. What would you say if a friend felt the same way about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them everyone has their quirks and that it’s normal to feel nervous. I wouldn’t judge them for it.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re able to offer compassion to others, which is wonderful. How about we try applying that same kindness to yourself? 

User: I suppose I could try to be more understanding with myself, but it’s hard in the moment.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging in the moment. What if we practiced some positive affirmations together? What might you say to yourself that could help ease that anxiety before you approach someone?

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay to be myself, and my uniqueness is valuable," or, "I deserve to make friends."

Consultant: Those affirmations are powerful! Let’s try these out in a hypothetical situation. Imagine you see someone you want to talk to—what would you do, and how would you remind yourself of these affirmations?

User: I would take a deep breath, remind myself of those affirmations, and then just approach them. Even if I feel nervous, I could tell myself it’s okay.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhao. Taking that deep breath and using affirmations can really help center you before social interactions. How do you feel about putting this into practice for the next week?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s like I have something to hold onto instead of just my nerves.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! As you practice, remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, but actively using those affirmations can shift your perspective. How do you think this will affect your interactions with your roommates?

User: I think it might help me approach them more openly. I won’t be so focused on my fears but rather on building connections.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Practicing these techniques might ease some tension and foster more genuine interactions. What do you think could be the first step in talking to them?

User: Maybe just starting with casual greetings or sharing a bit about my interests. I can try to create opportunities for conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy. Casual interactions can lay a good foundation. How about we set a small goal for you to achieve by our next session? 

User: I could aim to greet at least three classmates or roommates this week. It doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s a manageable goal that can gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about committing to that?

User: I feel good about it. Having something to focus on makes it seem more doable.

Consultant: Wonderful, Zhao! Remember to use your affirmations and take it step by step. As we work through these interactions, we can explore any thoughts or feelings that arise. 

User: Absolutely! I’m looking forward to our next session and seeing how it goes.

Consultant: Me too! I believe in your progress. You have the tools to change how you perceive these situations. Let's revisit this next time to see how it went and what learnings you had. 

User: Thanks! Talking with you always helps. I feel a bit more excited about trying it out.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You're taking important steps, Zhao. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I'll see you next time!

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao. Welcome back to our session today. I'm here to listen and support you. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite tense, especially around my roommate. I feel like he always thinks he's better than me, and it makes it hard for me to connect with him.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges in your relationship with your roommate. You feel a sense of tension and perhaps even rivalry with him. Can you share a bit more about a specific instance where you felt this way?

User: Well, the other day we had a conversation about our grades, and he was really boastful about his performance. I felt so small and unworthy compared to him. 

Consultant: That must have been a difficult moment for you. It's understandable to feel that way if someone is talking about their achievements in a way that makes you feel less than. In that situation, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I kept thinking that I would never be as good as him, that maybe I'm just not cut out for university life. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and discouraging. It's easy to see how they can impact your confidence. Can we explore the evidence for those thoughts a bit more? What successes or strengths do you have that counterbalance that belief about not being cut out for university?

User: I did manage to get into university, which was a big accomplishment for me. I’ve also worked hard on my assignments. I suppose I have my own strengths.

Consultant: Absolutely! Getting into university is a significant achievement, and working hard on your assignments shows dedication. Why do you think it’s so easy to overlook your own successes when feeling compared to someone else?

User: I think it's because I've always felt a bit inferior, especially when I see others who seem so confident.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a pattern of feeling inferior when faced with others' confidence. Let’s think about how you can challenge that pattern. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their own feelings of inferiority?

User: I’d probably tell them that they have their own unique strengths and that comparisons can be misleading.

Consultant: That's right! Comparisons can often lead us to overlook our own unique qualities and achievements. Now, how might that perspective change the way you interact with your roommate moving forward?

User: Maybe if I focus on my strengths, I can be more confident around him rather than feeling threatened.

Consultant: That's a great insight! By acknowledging your strengths, you can shift your focus from comparison to connection. How about we try to create an opportunity where you can practice that confidence? 

User: I guess I could invite him to study together. It might help with our relationship.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant plan! Studying together could provide a chance to bond. What do you hope to achieve from that interaction?

User: I hope it helps break the ice and maybe shows him that I have something to contribute too.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in this way might help you feel more connected and valued. And it’s a great step in building a positive relationship. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. I really want to improve things.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous before reaching out, but remember, hope is a wonderful feeling to hold onto. As we think about this, what would you say to yourself to encourage that hope on the day you plan to invite him?

User: I could remind myself that it's a chance for both of us to learn from each other, and it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Zhao. It's important to be yourself and embrace the opportunity to learn. As you prepare for this interaction, how can you ensure you keep that positive mindset?

User: Maybe I can write down some of the positive things I've done and keep reminding myself of that.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Keeping a list of your accomplishments can serve as a reminder of your worth and boost your confidence. Moving forward, how will you follow up after your study session with him?

User: I think I’ll reflect on how it went and try to see if I can keep the dialogue going, regardless of how I feel afterward.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach. Reflecting on the interaction will help you learn and grow from the experience. Have you noticed any changes in how you perceive your relationship with your roommate since we began discussing this?

User: Yes, I think I’m starting to realize that my worries might be exaggerated and that he may not be as intimidating as I thought.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Challenging those worries can open doors to better interactions. As we wrap up today, do you feel you have the tools to navigate your relationship with your roommate more effectively?

User: I do! I feel more equipped to manage my feelings and improve our relationship.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhao. Remember, building relationships takes time, but you're making great strides. Before we finish, let’s summarize your progress today and plan for your next steps.

User: Sure, I think I’ve recognized my strengths and developed a strategy to engage with my roommate.

Consultant: Exactly! You've made excellent progress in understanding your self-worth and planned actionable steps to enhance your relationship. Keep this momentum going, and we can discuss how it went in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next talk.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing with me today, Zhao. Remember, if you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time we talked about your feelings of being overlooked due to your father's new relationship. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low. I just can't shake off this feeling that I'm losing my place in my father's life. It’s tough to see him so happy with someone else.

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through a really difficult emotional time. You feel like your connection with your father might be fading because of this new relationship. Can you tell me more about how this is affecting your mood and daily life?

User: Yeah, it tends to make me feel really neglected. I used to think that my dad and I had a strong bond, but now I feel like everything is changing. I hardly get to talk to him, and when we do, it feels different.

Consultant: I can see why that would be painful for you. It seems like you're feeling a loss of connection and perhaps even some confusion about your relationship with him. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you think about your father and his new girlfriend?

User: I just keep thinking that maybe I’m not as important to him anymore. It makes me worried that he might choose her over me. 

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to have, and it sounds like it adds to your sense of anxiety. Let’s explore that idea a bit—how strong do you feel that thought is? Is there any evidence that supports or challenges this belief that he might choose her over you?

User: Well, he does spend a lot of time with her, and I haven’t had much of his attention lately. It's just hard to see the positive side when I feel left out.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable that you feel left out, especially with such big changes. It might help to consider how he has been with you in the past. Can you recall instances where he expressed love and support for you, even before this new relationship?

User: Yes, there were times when he would take me out or ask about my day. I guess I just feel like that might not happen as much anymore.

Consultant: Those memories are important and can serve as a reminder of the bond you share. It’s possible that even though he’s with someone new, he still cares deeply about you. How do you think you might express your feelings to him about this new dynamic?

User: I’m not sure. I’m afraid he might think I’m being selfish or just trying to get his attention. 

Consultant: It’s very common to fear how our feelings might be perceived. But expressing your emotional needs is important in maintaining a healthy relationship. What if you approached him in a calm moment and shared how you feel, focusing on your need for connection rather than blaming him?

User: That makes sense. I think I could try that, but I just worry about how he’ll react.

Consultant: It's natural to be concerned about his reaction. How about we role-play what that conversation might look like? It could help you feel more prepared and less anxious about it.

User: Okay, I’d be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re sitting down with your dad. You might start with something like, “Dad, I’ve been feeling a bit left out since you started dating. I’d love to spend more time with you.” How does that feel to say?

User: Honestly, it makes me a bit nervous, but it feels good to get that off my chest. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal—nervousness often accompanies expressing our feelings! Remember, this is about conveying your need for connection. What’s one small step you could take to approach this conversation?

User: Maybe I can just find a moment when he’s not busy and try to bring it up gently?

Consultant: Absolutely! Timing can make a huge difference. You could even ask him if he’d like to go for a walk or do something you both enjoy, which can create a relaxed atmosphere for the conversation. 

User: I like that idea. It might feel easier to talk that way.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on activities you both enjoy might help ease any tension. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the approach we discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I didn’t think about expressing my feelings this way before. It gives me some confidence.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to have doubts, but you’re taking positive steps toward expressing yourself. Let’s build on this confidence in our next session, and we can discuss how it went. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help with this.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhao! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How has your week been since our last session?

User: Hi. It's been okay, I guess. I've been trying to talk more with my roommate, but it still feels a bit awkward at times. I’m questioning if I really have the skills to make friends.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been putting in effort to connect with your roommate, which is a good step. Can you tell me more about those interactions and how they make you feel?

User: Well, sometimes it goes well, and we have good conversations, but other times I feel really hesitant to initiate a talk. I keep wondering if they find me interesting or if I'm just bothering them.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those thoughts, Zhao. It shows that you care about how you are perceived. When you feel hesitant to initiate a conversation, what specific thoughts run through your mind?

User: I think maybe I'm not good enough or that they might not want to talk to me. It feels like I'm an outsider sometimes.

Consultant: That feeling of being an outsider can be quite tough. Let’s explore those thoughts. How much evidence do you have that supports the idea that they don’t want to talk to you? Could there be other explanations?

User: I guess I don't really have solid evidence. They have talked to me when I do say something. Maybe I'm just overthinking things.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Zhao! Recognizing that you might be overthinking can help reduce some of the anxiety. If a friend were in your position, what do you think you would tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they're being too hard on themselves and that it's okay to make mistakes. Everyone feels awkward sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective can be very helpful. Let’s use that understanding for yourself. What if you approached your interactions with the mindset of being okay with making mistakes? How might that change your approach?

User: I think it would make me feel less pressured. I could just focus on having a conversation rather than worrying about it being perfect.

Consultant: Right! By giving yourself permission to be imperfect, you might open up more opportunities for connection. How about we role-play a scenario where you initiate a conversation with your roommate? 

User: That sounds interesting. I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re both in the common area. You could start with something light, like asking about their favorite TV shows. Let’s act it out. 

User: Okay. "Hey, what show are you watching lately? I’m looking for something new."

Consultant: That’s a good opener! How do you think your roommate would respond to that?

User: They might tell me about their show, and then I could ask more questions or share what I like too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing and asking questions creates a two-way conversation. If your roommate says they’re watching a show you like, how might you follow that up?

User: I could say, "Oh really? I love that show! What do you think of the last episode?" 

Consultant: Perfect! You’re already creating a comfortable dialogue. How are you feeling about this role-play exercise?

User: It’s making me feel a bit more confident. It’s nice to practice in a safe space.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practice is key. As you feel more confident, you can gradually challenge yourself to engage more in real conversations. What’s one small step you’re willing to take this week with your roommate?

User: I think I’ll try to ask them about their weekend plans and see if we can make plans together.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Zhao! It shows proactivity and interest in building a connection. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It feels like a good opportunity.

Consultant: Embracing that mix of excitement and nervousness is part of the process. Remember, it’s about connection, not perfection. When we meet next, I’d love to hear how that conversation went. 

User: I will definitely share! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhao! I’m proud of your efforts and the steps you’re taking. Don’t forget to be kind to yourself in this journey. I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to communicate more with my dad, but it's still challenging. I feel frustrated sometimes because I worry that I’m not being understood.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to connect with your dad but still facing some barriers. Can you tell me more about a specific conversation that made you feel this way?

User: Well, last weekend, I tried to tell him how I felt about his new girlfriend. I thought I was being honest, but I noticed he seemed a bit defensive.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s tough when we feel vulnerable while trying to express our feelings, especially about something sensitive like a new relationship. What thoughts were running through your mind during that conversation?

User: I kept thinking that he might not take me seriously or that he would dismiss my feelings. I felt anxious about how he would react.

Consultant: Those thoughts can make it difficult to communicate openly. It seems like you were worried about being heard. Do you recall how those feelings affected your ability to express yourself in that moment?

User: Yes, I ended up not saying everything I wanted to say. I kind of shut down because I was afraid of his reaction.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can be hard to open up when we’re feeling anxious. Let’s take a moment to explore these thoughts. What evidence do you have that your dad might dismiss your feelings about his girlfriend?

User: I don’t have direct evidence, but I remember how he reacted when I mentioned my concerns about my parents’ divorce. He seemed upset and didn’t want to discuss it.

Consultant: It sounds like past experiences are influencing your current thoughts. Could there be other explanations for his reactions? Perhaps he was dealing with his own feelings at that time?

User: I guess that’s possible. I never really thought of it that way. Maybe he just needs time to adjust.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes our loved ones have their own emotions to navigate, which can impact how they respond. Let’s focus on how you can express your feelings more effectively. What would you like your dad to understand about your thoughts on his girlfriend?

User: I’d like him to know that I just want us to have a good relationship, and that's why I feel a bit uncomfortable.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! You want to express your desire for a positive relationship. How do you think you can approach this in a way that encourages open dialogue?

User: Maybe I can start by asking him how he feels about everything and then share my feelings afterward?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Starting with his feelings may help him feel more at ease, making him more open to listening to you. Would you like to practice how you might begin that conversation?

User: Yes, that would be helpful!

Consultant: Ok, let’s role play. You can start the conversation and I’ll respond as your dad. Go ahead!

User: Dad, I wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend. How do you feel about her?

Consultant: I think she's nice. Why do you ask?

User: Well, I just want to make sure we're all comfortable with each other. It’s important for me that we have a good relationship.

Consultant: I appreciate that, Zhao. It means a lot that you care about our relationship. 

Consultant: That was great! You expressed your thoughts clearly and invited him to share his feelings. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good! I noticed I was more confident when I focused on asking him about his feelings first.

Consultant: Excellent! This technique can help you create a more open atmosphere for discussion. As you practice this, how do you think it will affect your confidence in communicating with him?

User: I believe it will help me feel more secure when expressing myself. I won’t feel as anxious if I know I’m listening to him too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing listening and sharing can foster mutual understanding. Before we wrap up, what specific action can you take this week to apply what you practiced today?

User: I’ll try talking to my dad this weekend and see how he reacts to my approach.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. How will you check in with yourself afterward to assess how you felt during the conversation?

User: I guess I can note down my feelings and how the conversation went afterward. That way, I can evaluate what worked and what didn't.

Consultant: Great idea! Reflecting on your experiences will help you adjust and improve. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking, Zhao. For our next session, we can discuss how it went and explore any emotions you experienced.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared to handle the conversation now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to communicate effectively. Keep up the great work, and remember, I'm here to support you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Zhao! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling better overall. My confidence in social situations is improving, and I've been trying to engage more with my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making some positive strides in your social interactions. Can you share a specific moment where you felt more confident recently?

User: Sure! Last week, I joined a study group for the first time. I was a bit nervous at first, but I ended up enjoying the discussion. I even contributed some ideas.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! Engaging in group discussions can be challenging, but it seems like you handled it well. How did that experience make you feel about your social skills?

User: It made me feel proud of myself. I realized I can contribute, and it’s not as intimidating as I thought it would be.

Consultant: I'm really happy for you, Zhao! Feeling proud is a great indicator of your improving confidence. Since we talked about maintaining and enhancing this progress, have you thought about any strategies or approaches you might want to try moving forward?

User: I've been thinking that I could attend more group activities or clubs on campus. I want to keep pushing myself to meet new people.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in clubs could definitely open up more opportunities for social interactions. What kind of clubs or activities are you interested in?

User: I'm interested in joining a photography club and maybe a debate club. I've always enjoyed photography, and I think debates could help me with my public speaking skills.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Both clubs align well with your interests and goals for enhancing your social skills. How do you feel about stepping out of your comfort zone to join these activities?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but I'm also excited. I know stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to personal growth.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective, Zhao! It’s normal to feel anxious about new experiences, but your excitement shows that you’re ready for this challenge. To help you prepare, what might be some small steps you could take to ease into these activities?

User: Maybe I could start by attending a meeting as an observer first. That way, I can get a feel for the environment before jumping in.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach! Observing first can make the transition easier. Also, have you reflected on any techniques you've learned in our sessions that could help manage your anxiety during these activities?

User: Yes, I remember some breathing exercises we practiced together. I think I could use those to calm myself before joining any meeting.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Breathing exercises can really help center you and reduce anxiety. You’ve made significant progress in awareness and skills. Looking back at our sessions, what do you believe has been the most beneficial for you?

User: I think understanding my thought patterns and recognizing when I'm being too harsh on myself has helped me a lot. It has made me more compassionate towards myself.

Consultant: That’s a meaningful insight, and it's so important! Being compassionate to yourself will aid in maintaining your confidence and motivation. As we conclude this session, let's summarize your progress and your next steps toward sustaining these improvements. 

User: That sounds good. I feel like I have a clear direction now.

Consultant: Excellent! You've set some ambitious yet achievable goals. As you engage with new activities, remember the skills you've learned here. And if you encounter challenges, what strategies can you use to navigate through them?

User: I can rely on my breathing techniques and also remind myself of my accomplishments so far. That should help me stay positive.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Keep those techniques in mind. I’m confident that you will continue to excel in your social endeavors. This is our final session, and I want you to know that you've gained some valuable tools along the way. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all your support throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, you always have the skills to manage challenges ahead. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care and best of luck! 

User: Thank you! I will definitely reach out if I need help in the future.
