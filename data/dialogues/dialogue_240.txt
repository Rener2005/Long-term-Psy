Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad you're here today. Before we begin, I want to check in with you about what’s been going on recently. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really down. Since I switched from humanities to science and joined a new class, I feel like I don’t fit in. I haven't communicated with my classmates at all, and it feels like they’re excluding me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant feelings of isolation and sadness. That can be really tough, especially in a new environment. Can you tell me more about your interactions or lack thereof with your new classmates?

User: Well, I just feel like I’m on the outside looking in. I try to initiate conversations, but it doesn’t go anywhere. They seem to be in their own groups, and I just feel invisible.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Feeling invisible can be a heavy burden to carry. What emotions come up for you when you think about these interactions, or the absence of them?

User: I often feel sad and angry. Sometimes, I just want to throw things to let it out because I don’t know how else to express what I’m feeling.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when emotions become overwhelming. Finding a way to express them is important. Let's try to explore what's at the root of those feelings. What thoughts go through your mind about your classmates or your social situation when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that they don’t want to get to know me, or that I’m just not likable. It's like I'm doomed to be alone in this class.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, Xiaoke. It seems like you're feeling a lot of self-doubt about your social abilities. Can we take a moment to challenge that belief? What evidence do you have that supports this idea that they don’t want to get to know you?

User: Well, I guess there isn’t much evidence. They haven't said anything directly to me, but their actions speak volumes, you know?

Consultant: I understand. It’s easy to misinterpret actions, especially when we're feeling vulnerable. But let's consider this—if a friend was in your shoes, what would you say to them? Would you encourage them to think this way?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s normal to feel awkward in a new place and that it doesn’t mean they’re unlikable.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d be offering a more balanced perspective. It sounds like you already have the ability to see things differently for someone else, so let’s apply that same kindness to yourself. What could be another way to think about your classmates’ actions?

User: Maybe they’re just shy too? Or they're busy making their own friend groups?

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s very possible they are navigating their own challenges. Now, let’s brainstorm together. What small steps could you take to connect with your classmates? 

User: I could try to join in on their conversations even if I feel nervous. Maybe I could start by saying hi.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Starting with a simple greeting can be a great way to break the ice. What do you think you might feel in that moment when you say hi?

User: I might feel anxious, but also a little hopeful that they might respond positively.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling to have. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious too—it's a natural part of stepping outside your comfort zone. What about cultivating some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, to help manage that anxiety before you attempt to connect?

User: That sounds helpful. I haven’t really tried deep breathing before. How does that work?

Consultant: Deep breathing is simple. It involves inhaling deeply through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. It can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together… and hold it… now slowly exhale. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice to just focus on my breath for a moment. I felt a little calmer.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating this into your routine when you feel overwhelmed may help you face challenges with more clarity. As we wrap up our session today, how do you feel about the steps we discussed regarding your classmates and managing your emotions?

User: I feel a bit better. It's nice to know that I can try small things to improve my situation, even if I still struggle with these thoughts.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiaoke. It’s okay to feel unsure, but taking those small steps can lead to positive change. Let’s keep working on those beliefs and skills together next time. 

User: Definitely! I'm looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too! Remember, you're not alone in this, and it’s okay to reach out whenever you need. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been trying to use the emotional management techniques we discussed during class discussions, but I still feel a bit withdrawn because my classmates seem indifferent to me.

Consultant: It sounds frustrating to feel that way despite your efforts. I'm proud of you for trying to engage with your peers. Can you tell me more about a recent interaction that made you feel this way?

User: Well, I spoke up in class the other day, but it felt like no one was really listening. They hardly responded, and it made me doubt if I should even try again.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel discouraged. When you reached out, it felt like your voice went unheard. What thoughts crossed your mind in that moment?

User: I thought maybe I’m not interesting enough, or that they just don’t want to be friends with me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to carry. It seems like you're feeling a lot of self-doubt. How do you feel when you think about your ability to connect with others?

User: I feel really unsure of myself. It's like I don't know how to make friends anymore. I used to be more confident about it.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel unsure, especially after a recent change in your environment. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. Is there any evidence that suggests you're not interesting or that others don’t want to connect with you?

User: Well, I guess I have had some positive interactions before, but they feel far away now. 

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It sounds like you have had some connections in the past. What do you think made those interactions successful for you?

User: I think I was more relaxed and open to the conversation. I felt like I was being myself.

Consultant: Being relaxed and authentic is a powerful approach. How can we integrate those feelings into your next interaction? What small step do you think you could take to foster a connection with others?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple question in class, just to get a conversation going. 

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Starting with a simple question can make it feel less intimidating. How do you think you could feel after trying that?

User: I think it would help me feel more proactive, which is something I need right now. 

Consultant: That sounds promising! Taking proactive steps can boost your confidence. Would you like to set a specific goal for this week regarding your social interactions?

User: Yes! How about I try to ask at least one person a question in class every day?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It’s achievable and helps ease you into social interaction. How do you think you’ll celebrate or acknowledge those small victories if you achieve them?

User: I could maybe treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or taking a break to watch a show.

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Rewarding yourself can reinforce positive efforts. Now, is there anything that you feel might hold you back from reaching your goal this week?

User: I guess I'm worried about being rejected or ignored again. 

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal, and it's okay to be worried. But remember, it doesn't define your worth or ability to connect. If someone doesn't respond, how might you remind yourself that this doesn't mean you’re not interesting?

User: I can tell myself that not everyone will connect right away, and it doesn't reflect on me as a person. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great coping strategy to have. Let’s also think about how you can build on positive experiences as you try to connect with others. What positive experience can we highlight today?

User: I think I did quite well in a recent group project. I worked with others and contributed my ideas.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic experience to hold onto! It shows you can collaborate and share valuable thoughts. How does that make you feel about your social abilities?

User: It gives me hope. I guess I can use that as a reminder of what I can achieve socially.

Consultant: Absolutely! Holding on to those positive experiences can create a more balanced view of your social skills. As we move forward, let’s focus on reinforcing this mindset. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel a bit more positive and ready to try. I like the idea of setting small goals.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! Remember, progress takes time and small steps. When we meet again, we can reflect on these experiences and continue to develop your social strategies. Is there anything else on your mind today before we wrap up?

User: No, I think this has been really helpful. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoke! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you're making progress! Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel a bit anxious about fitting in with my classmates. I had some good interactions recently, but I also experienced some situations where I felt left out.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel a mix of emotions when trying to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what you felt during those moments when you felt left out?

User: I felt really disappointed and kind of lonely. I thought I was making progress, but those moments just brought me back down.

Consultant: It's tough to experience setbacks, especially after feeling some positive interactions. It’s great that you’ve had some good moments, though. What do you think it was about those positive interactions that made you feel good?

User: I felt accepted and happy when I was part of a group discussion. Everyone was friendly, and I was able to contribute my thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience! It seems like being included in discussions boosts your confidence. Have you thought about ways to create more of those kinds of opportunities for yourself?

User: I guess I could try to join more group activities or clubs at school, but I'm still a bit nervous about it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about joining new groups. What if we explore what specifically makes you nervous about joining? Understanding this can help us develop strategies to make it easier.

User: I worry that people might not like me or that I'd embarrass myself. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging. Let's think about the evidence for these concerns. Do you have any past experiences that contradict these worries, where people welcomed you?

User: I did have some nice experiences when joining the study group. They were really welcoming and included me in their discussions.

Consultant: That’s a positive experience to hold onto! How can we remind you of that moment when you're feeling anxious about fitting in again? Perhaps we can create some strategies together.

User: Maybe I could remind myself of that moment when I feel nervous, like telling myself that there are people who are open and friendly. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Building that kind of self-encouragement can help you navigate those tough moments. How about we practice some role-play scenarios where you could see yourself initiating a conversation in a group?

User: That sounds helpful! I could practice how to introduce myself or join in on different topics. 

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s say you approach a group seated together. How would you start that conversation? 

User: I might say something like, “Hey, can I join you guys? I’m Xiaoke, and I just wanted to be part of the discussion.”

Consultant: That’s a warm and friendly opener! It expresses your interest and invites connection. What might be a follow-up question you could ask to keep the conversation flowing?

User: Maybe I could ask what they’re discussing or share my opinion about a recent class topic.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging with their topic shows you’re interested and invested. What do you feel when you think about taking this step?

User: I feel a bit excited but also a little scared. What if they don’t respond positively?

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that mix of excitement and fear. Remember, even if one interaction doesn't go as planned, it doesn’t define your ability to connect in the future. What’s something you can remind yourself next time you feel scared?

User: I could tell myself that not every interaction has to be perfect and that I have my past experiences to lean on. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! It’s about learning and growing with each experience. As you prepare to try more group activities, what’s one goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: I think I’d like to start by attending one after-school club meeting, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Taking that step can help you expand your social circle and reinforce those positive experiences. How will you commit to this goal?

User: I’ll mark it on my calendar and remind myself that it’s okay to feel a bit nervous. I’ll focus on just going.

Consultant: I love that commitment! Remember, it’s a process, and each small step is valuable. As we approach the end of our session, how are you feeling about the steps we discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful and motivated. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress already, and I believe you have what it takes to continue strengthening your social connections. Before we wrap up, what’s one key takeaway you have from today’s session?

User: I realize that it’s okay to feel scared, but I have supportive past experiences to build on, and that makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: Exactly! Let that realization guide you moving forward. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You’re doing great, Xiaoke!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next talk too!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad to see you today. It's great to hear that you've been enjoying positive interactions with new friends. How have you been feeling recently in terms of your social life?

User: Hi! I feel really happy lately. Ever since I joined the school club, I've been having a lot of fun with my new friends. It's nice to feel included, and I'm starting to explore my interests more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of belonging, which is a key part of feeling good socially. Can you share more about what you enjoy doing with your new friends?

User: Well, we do a lot of activities together, like group projects and playing games. I feel like I can be myself around them, and it's really refreshing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're building a genuine connection with your peers, which is so important. What kind of activities do you feel most engaged in when you're with them?

User: I really like the group projects because we get to brainstorm ideas together. It feels really collaborative, and I enjoy contributing my thoughts.

Consultant: Collaboration can be really fulfilling. It’s great to hear that you're finding joy in sharing your ideas. How do you feel when you're actively participating in those projects?

User: I feel confident and valued. It’s nice to know that my opinions matter and to see the group come together.

Consultant: That’s such a positive feeling! Building confidence through group interactions can really boost your self-esteem. Have you noticed any changes in how you view your own abilities since joining the club?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel more confident about myself and my skills. It's like I’m starting to believe that I can be good at things I enjoy.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, Xiaoke! It's great to see how actively engaging with others has positively influenced your self-perception. What are some other activities or interests you’d like to explore with your friends?

User: I’ve been thinking about trying out some creative workshops, like painting or music. I want to share those experiences with others too.

Consultant: Exploring creative outlets sounds like an excellent idea! Not only will it allow you to express yourself, but it could also strengthen your connections with your friends. What do you think you might gain from participating in these workshops?

User: I think it would be fun, and maybe I’ll discover new talents or interests. Plus, it would be nice to learn something new together with friends.

Consultant: Learning together can really enhance your bond with others, and it often creates unforgettable memories. Have you thought about how you can motivate yourself to start these new activities?

User: I haven’t really planned it out yet, but I think setting a goal to try one workshop a month could be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Setting manageable goals can make it easier to step out of your comfort zone. How do you feel about committing to that goal?

User: I think I feel excited about it! It gives me something to look forward to, and I want to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: Embracing excitement is a wonderful mindset! Moments of excitement can really help you feel more alive and engaged. How can you ensure that you keep this momentum going as you pursue these interests?

User: I could schedule specific times to look for workshops and also invite friends to join me. That way, we can support each other.

Consultant: Involving your friends in the planning can definitely keep you motivated. It's reassuring to have that support system in place. What challenges might you face as you pursue these new activities?

User: I guess I might worry about whether I’ll fit in or if I’ll be good at them. But I think sharing these concerns with my friends will help.

Consultant: That's a very insightful observation, Xiaoke. It's normal to have those worries, but being open with your friends can help alleviate some of that anxiety. How do you think you could manage those worries if they come up during a workshop?

User: I think I could remind myself that it’s about having fun and learning, not about being perfect. Plus, my friends will be there, which makes it easier.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the joy of the experience rather than perfection can significantly reduce pressure. It’s all about enjoying the journey. Reflecting on everything we've talked about today, how would you summarize your feelings about your social growth?

User: I feel really proud of how far I've come. I'm more confident and excited to explore new things. Connecting with my friends makes me feel supported.

Consultant: You should be proud, Xiaoke! It’s heartening to see how your confidence has blossomed through social interaction. As we wrap up our session, what will you take away as you continue to engage with your friends and pursue your interests?

User: I’ll take away the importance of support, being open about my feelings, and the idea of setting goals. I really want to keep this positive vibe going!

Consultant: Those are wonderful takeaways! Remember, maintaining that positive outlook will help you continue to grow socially. This is a great place to end for today. If you ever feel the need for support again, know that you are always welcome to come back.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiake! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had a successful experience recently that boosted your confidence. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling now, especially after the positive feedback from your peers?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm feeling really good about myself lately. The feedback I received in the club made me realize that I can really contribute and be acknowledged for my skills. It’s a nice change compared to before when I felt uncertain about how people viewed me.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It’s wonderful that you feel more acknowledged and valued. It seems like this experience has opened up some positive thoughts about yourself. How do you think this newfound confidence has affected your interactions with others?

User: I think I’m more open and willing to engage in conversations. I used to feel shy and worry about what others would think of me, but now I feel like I belong. It's encouraging!

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Feeling a sense of belonging can be incredibly empowering. What specific thoughts do you have when you're interacting with your classmates now compared to before?

User: Now, I often think, “I can share my thoughts,” and “They appreciate me.” Before, I would hesitate and think, “What if they don’t like what I say?” 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re replacing negative thoughts with more positive affirmations. This is a great step in building your self-worth. Have you noticed any challenges that still pop up, or is there anything that might be holding you back from fully embracing this new mindset?

User: Sometimes, I still worry about disappointing people. Like, if I mess up in front of them, I fear they might not see me the same way again. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's common to have concerns about not living up to expectations. What evidence do you have that supports the fear of disappointment versus the positive feedback you've received?

User: Well, I guess I don’t actually have much evidence. I mean, they’ve been really supportive lately, but my mind just jumps to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize that! It seems like your mind is holding onto some old patterns of thinking that may not be as relevant anymore. What might happen if you challenged that worst-case scenario when you’re feeling anxious about disappointing someone?

User: I think I could try to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it won't change how people perceive me overall. 

Consultant: That’s a solid perspective! By actively reminding yourself of that, you’re reframing the situation. How could you incorporate this strategy into your daily life to help reinforce your positive self-view?

User: Maybe I could write it down or say it to myself before engaging with others. Like a little mantra or something.

Consultant: Writing it down or creating a mantra can serve as a powerful reminder! This could help you internalize the idea that one mistake doesn’t define your worth. What else could you do to ensure you're maintaining this confidence going forward?

User: I could also focus on celebrating my small achievements along the way, like acknowledging when I participate in class or support a friend. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small wins can strengthen your self-efficacy and help solidify your confidence. How do you feel about setting aside time each week to reflect on these achievements?

User: That sounds helpful! I could dedicate a journal page just to that. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Journaling can provide you with a tangible way to see your progress and reinforce positive thoughts. Now, let’s think ahead. As you continue to develop this confidence, what goals do you have to maintain this positive mind frame?

User: I want to keep pushing myself to try new things and not be afraid of the outcome. Maybe joining another club or participating in more group activities.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Trying new things can further expand your social opportunities and help build your confidence. How will you ensure you stay grounded and focused on your accomplishments in those new activities?

User: I guess I’ll keep reminding myself to reflect on my feelings afterward, no matter how it goes. I want to learn from the experience, not just focus on the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Focusing on your feelings and experiences rather than just the results can lead to growth and self-acceptance. As we wrap up, how have you felt about our conversation today? 

User: I feel more clear-headed for sure. I appreciate the suggestions and feel more equipped to handle my thoughts when they start to spiral.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s amazing to see your progress and your willingness to engage with these strategies. As you continue to implement these techniques, remember that it’s a journey, and you can always reflect on your growth. 

User: Thank you! I really feel more positive about everything now. I’ll definitely keep practicing what we've talked about.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiake! I’m proud of your willingness to work on these aspects of yourself. When you reflect on your journey, how do you plan to acknowledge your progress and how far you’ve come?

User: By keeping track in my journal, I’ll note not only what I've achieved, but also how I felt along the way. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! By tracing your feelings and achievements together, you'll cultivate a deeper understanding of your growth. If you ever need guidance or feel uncertain, know that you can always reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. 

Consultant: Take care, Xiake! I look forward to hearing about your journey the next time we meet. Remember, you're on the right path!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoke! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. The conversation with my parents really lifted my spirits. I feel more balanced and hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that the conversation with your parents had such a positive impact. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel this way?

User: Well, they encouraged me a lot regarding my recent decision to switch from arts to science. It feels nice to have their support, especially since we don't talk often.

Consultant: Having supportive parents can really make a difference, especially during times of change. How do you think their encouragement affects your mindset and approach to school?

User: I think their encouragement helps me feel more confident and motivated. I’m looking forward to tackling new subjects, and I feel less anxious about it now.

Consultant: It sounds like their support has played a significant role in your confidence and motivation. What strategies do you think you can use to maintain this positive momentum as you face new challenges at school?

User: I guess I could keep in touch with them more often to share my progress. Also, I want to set small goals for myself each week to stay on track.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Staying connected with your parents and setting achievable goals can really help you maintain your motivation. What specific goals do you have in mind for the upcoming weeks?

User: I want to focus on understanding my new science subjects better. I’d like to get a grasp on the basics first, and then build from there.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! By focusing on the fundamentals, you’ll create a strong foundation for your studies. How do you feel about your learning style? Do you think there are ways you could adjust it to improve your understanding?

User: I think I might need to be more active in my learning. Maybe forming study groups could help me understand better through discussion and collaboration.

Consultant: Forming study groups could definitely enhance your understanding and make studying more enjoyable. Have you considered initiating or joining any groups yet?

User: Not yet, but I plan to talk to my classmates and see if anyone's interested in forming one. I think it could really help.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Engaging with classmates not only aids learning but also builds connections. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think it’s worth a shot. I want to overcome that feeling of hesitation.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about reaching out. Do you think there are specific thoughts that contribute to that anxiety? 

User: I worry that they might not want to include me or think I’m not capable. 

Consultant: I understand those worries. It's common to have thoughts that make us doubt ourselves. Let’s challenge that a bit. What evidence do you have that they would think that way?

User: I guess I don’t have much proof. Most of them seem friendly—it's probably just my own insecurities talking.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Sometimes our insecurities can lead us to think negatively about others' perceptions. How about reframing that thought? If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d tell them that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and being together can help everyone improve.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage your friend to step out of their comfort zone, and you deserve that same encouragement from yourself. How do you feel about taking that step now?

User: I feel a bit more motivated. I’ll try to talk to them soon!

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiaoke! Remember, taking small steps is key. As we wrap up today, can we summarize the progress you've made and any actions you want to take moving forward?

User: Sure! I’ve recognized the importance of my parents' support, the benefit of setting small goals, and the potential of forming a study group. I want to reach out to my classmates soon.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary! You’ve gained valuable insights during our sessions, and I believe these strategies will serve you well. If any challenges arise, remember to use your coping skills. I believe you can continue this journey successfully.

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped to handle my new challenges now.

Consultant: You're very welcome. Remember, you can always come back if you need support. Take care, Xiaoke, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.
