Consultant: Hello, K! I'm really glad you could join me today. I know things have been tough for you lately. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low. My mood hasn’t really improved, and it's hard to get to sleep at night. Sometimes I really feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I understand that it’s been difficult for you. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed and having trouble sleeping. Can you tell me more about the thoughts or feelings that come up when you're in those moments?

User: Well, when I think about everything I have to do, like schoolwork and exams, it just feels like too much. And since my friend and I aren’t as close now, I feel really alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure from school and also dealing with the loneliness from losing that friendship. When you think about schoolwork and exams, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I keep thinking that I’m just not good enough and that I’ll fail everything. Sometimes I even think that it’s not worth it to try.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of self-doubt. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your feelings day-to-day?

User: Yes, they make me feel even worse. I get anxious and just want to avoid studying altogether. It’s like a cycle that I can’t seem to break.

Consultant: That cycle can definitely feel suffocating. Let’s explore that together. When you think, "I'm not good enough," how does that make you feel in your body and mind?

User: It makes my chest feel tight, and I just feel this wave of sadness. I want to cry, but then I get angry at myself for feeling that way.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of sadness and frustration with yourself. Can we try to identify what other thoughts might be contributing to that sadness and frustration?

User: Okay. I guess I also think that no one really cares about me, especially since my friend is distant now. It just reinforces that I’m alone.

Consultant: Feeling alone can be really painful. When you think nobody cares, what emotion does that bring out in you?

User: It definitely brings out sadness. I feel abandoned and like I'm not worth anyone’s time.

Consultant: Those feelings of abandonment are incredibly tough to deal with. Let’s challenge that thought for a moment. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that nobody cares about you?

User: Well, I know my parents care about me, and I do have some classmates who check in sometimes, so I guess it’s not entirely true.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, K! You just identified some positive connections. Sometimes when we’re feeling down, our minds can trick us into thinking that we are completely alone. How does acknowledging that there are people who care about you change the way you feel?

User: I guess it makes me feel a little less heavy. But it’s still hard to shake off those thoughts.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s okay to feel that way. Can we think of a few things you can do to reach out and reinforce those connections with people who care about you? 

User: Maybe I could message a classmate or try to reconnect with my friend again, even if it makes me nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking small steps can be really empowering. And how do you think you would feel if you take those steps to reach out?

User: I think it might help me feel more connected, but I’m still scared of getting rejected.

Consultant: That’s a valid fear, and it’s completely normal to feel anxious about reaching out. Let’s think about how you can handle that fear if it comes up. What would you tell a friend in your shoes who felt the same way?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to feel scared and that reaching out is brave. They might surprise themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve just offered yourself some wisdom that can be quite soothing. Would you consider using that perspective when you feel scared about reaching out?

User: Yes, I can try that. It sounds helpful to shift my mindset a bit.

Consultant: Fantastic, K. This shift in thinking can be very powerful. As we consider moving forward, let’s also discuss your emotions and any additional strategies that may help you cope with these feelings.

User: I think some strategies would be beneficial, especially those that can help me deal with stress and anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can look into techniques like mindfulness or breathing exercises that you can use when you start feeling overwhelmed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I need all the help I can get right now.

Consultant: Remember, it’s okay to take one step at a time. You’re showing great self-awareness today, and that’s a big part of the journey. We’ll keep building from here. What would you like to focus on for our next session?

User: I’d like to understand more about managing my emotions and maybe practice those strategies you mentioned.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, K! We’ll prioritize emotional management and those strategies. I’m here to support you, and I believe you can make progress. Thank you for sharing openly today. You’ve done a great job.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll try to take what we talked about and work on it until next time.

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today, K. Before we get started, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been tough. I'm still feeling down and overwhelmed. My studies aren't improving, and I just feel like I can't keep up with everything that's happening at school.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're still struggling with the pressure from school and feeling a bit stuck in your current situation. Can you share more about what specifically is making you feel overwhelmed?

User: Well, the coursework has gotten a lot harder, and I feel like I can’t understand anything. Sometimes, I just freeze up and can’t even start my assignments. 

Consultant: That must be really frustrating for you. It's understandable to feel anxious when the work becomes tougher. How would you ideally like to handle this situation?

User: I wish I could just start my assignments without feeling so anxious. I want to feel confident that I can understand the material.

Consultant: That’s a good goal. Building up that confidence can certainly help you tackle your assignments. Can we talk about a time when you felt more confident in your abilities? What was different then?

User: I guess it was last year when I was doing well in my classes. I was more engaged, and I didn’t feel nearly as much pressure. I just had fun with my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like enjoying your studies made a big difference for you. What do you think changed since then that has affected your confidence?

User: I think the expectations have just gotten higher and I’ve started comparing myself to others. I don’t think I'm as smart or capable as my classmates.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can often distort our perception of our own abilities. It’s common to feel inadequate in those situations. How does this comparison make you feel when you think about it?

User: It makes me feel even worse. I start to doubt myself, and then I get anxious and panicky about not measuring up.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle to be in. It's important to address those thoughts when they arise. Can we explore some of those negative thoughts together? When you compare yourself to your classmates, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I usually think things like "I will never catch up" or "I'm just not smart enough." Those kinds of thoughts just spiral out of control.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very damaging. Let’s try to challenge them. How much evidence do you have that these thoughts are true? Can you think of any instances that contradict those beliefs?

User: Well, I did manage to pass my exams last year. Maybe I’m not as far behind as I think. But sometimes I still feel like I’m just faking it.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize those moments of success. It’s normal to feel like an impostor at times, but it’s helpful to remind ourselves of our achievements. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they are capable and have done well before, so they can get through this too.

Consultant: Exactly! You have those same capabilities within you. Let’s focus on small steps you can take to create a supportive environment for yourself while you study. What kind of strategies do you think might help you feel a bit more grounded?

User: I think breaking down my tasks into smaller parts would help. Maybe setting up a schedule could make things feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a solid idea! Creating a schedule can give you structure and make tasks feel more manageable. How about we outline a plan together to start with your assignments?

User: Sure, that would be helpful. I could list out my subjects and break them into smaller chunks.

Consultant: Perfect! Together we can identify specific tasks within each subject, and set realistic deadlines for when you’d like to complete them. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I'm feeling a little less anxious thinking about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Additionally, remember to include breaks in your schedule to give yourself time to recharge. How do you usually prefer to take breaks?

User: I like to go out for a short walk or listen to music. It helps clear my mind.

Consultant: Those are great ways to relax! Incorporating breaks can really help maintain your focus and reduce anxiety. Would you feel comfortable committing to this plan for the coming week?

User: Yes, I think I can try that. It feels more doable when I have a plan.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, K. Before we wrap up, let's discuss how you can approach conversations with your family about your needs and feelings. How do you feel about talking to them?

User: I’m not sure. Sometimes I feel like they won’t understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that worry. Would it help to share some of these feelings with them, even a little bit? You might be surprised at their response.

User: Maybe I could try that. It would be nice to have their support, but I don’t know where to start. 

Consultant: We can brainstorm some simple ways to begin those conversations. Perhaps start by sharing how school has been tough for you lately and how you’re trying to cope. Does that sound manageable?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I could just be honest about how I’ve been feeling.

Consultant: Absolutely! Honesty can help bridge understanding. As we conclude today, let’s recap your action points. You will create a study schedule, approach your family about your feelings, and take breaks in a way that helps you relax.

User: Yes, I’ll definitely work on those things. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're welcome, K! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it's okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today, K. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things are still pretty tough. There’s a lot of tension at home, and I feel lost when trying to communicate with my family. I hope I can find a way to talk to them without it turning into an argument.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s good that you recognize the need for change in your family communication. Can you share a specific situation where you felt that tension most recently?

User: Well, just the other day, I tried to explain why I was feeling down, but my parents just didn’t seem to understand. It ended up with them getting frustrated, and I felt even worse afterward. 

Consultant: I can see why that would be incredibly frustrating for you. It’s hard when you want to be understood but feel like your feelings are dismissed. What do you think caused the misunderstanding during that conversation?

User: I think they just don’t really know what I’m going through. They say I should just focus on school and not worry so much, but it feels like there’s more to it than that.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It sounds like there’s a gap in understanding each other’s perspectives. How do you usually express your feelings when you talk to them? 

User: I usually just mention I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I guess I don’t explain it well. I often just get emotional and don’t really say what I need from them.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, K. It’s common for emotions to take over in tough conversations. Would you like to explore some ways to express your feelings more clearly when you talk to your family?

User: Yes, that would help a lot. I want to communicate better, but I don’t know where to start.

Consultant: Let's start by thinking about how to structure your thoughts before you talk to them. One approach is to express your feelings using “I” statements, which focus more on your experience rather than blaming others. For example, instead of saying "You never listen," try saying "I feel upset when I don't feel heard.” 

User: That makes sense. It sounds less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! It helps to reduce defensiveness. How do you feel about trying to implement that in your next conversation with them?

User: I think I can try that. But I worry that they might still not understand where I’m coming from.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It's important to stay open to how they may respond, but also remember that expressing your feelings is a step towards understanding. Are there any specific situations you can think of where you can practice this?

User: Maybe this weekend when we’re having dinner together. I could start to talk about how school has been stressful.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! You could also prepare a little beforehand about what you want to share. How do you think you might introduce the topic when the moment feels right?

User: I could say something like, “I want to share something important about how school has been for me lately.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start. It sets the tone for a more serious conversation. How do you feel about the idea of taking this step during dinner?

User: A bit nervous, but also hopeful. I really want to make things better.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. It’s normal to feel nervous, but remember, each conversation is an opportunity to practice. What do you think you might do if the conversation takes a negative turn?

User: I guess I could try to take a deep breath and remember the “I” statements. 

Consultant: Yes, staying calm and using your new skills will help you manage that situation. It’s also okay to pause and take a moment if things get heated. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I’ll try to keep my composure.

Consultant: Perfect! So, after your dinner conversation, let’s plan to discuss how it went in our next session. It’ll be important to reflect on what worked well and what didn’t.

User: Yes, I definitely want to talk about it. I hope I can see some real progress.

Consultant: I’m confident that with practice, you will see progress. Remember, building communication skills is a process. Do you have any other thoughts or concerns before we wrap up today?

User: No, I feel like we’ve covered a lot. Just excited and a bit anxious about this weekend.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. I'm excited for you too! Just remember to be patient with yourself. I’m looking forward to hearing about how your conversation goes next time. 

User: Thanks, I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, K! I’m here to support you. Take care, and see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, K! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better lately, especially after making some new friends at school. But I still struggle with keeping my emotions stable.

Consultant: That's great to hear about your new friendships! It sounds like you're experiencing some positive changes. Can you tell me more about how these friendships have influenced your emotions?

User: Well, I feel a lot more confident when I'm around them. We work together on projects, and I think we did really well in our last school activity. But there are still times when I feel really low, and I don't know how to handle it.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re finding support in your new friendships and feeling more confident! It's normal to have ups and downs, so let's explore those low moments together. What do you typically feel or think during those times?

User: I often feel overwhelmed and start to think that I'm not good enough, especially when I compare myself to others. Sometimes this leads to me acting out, like hitting my head or feeling the urge to harm myself.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing such intense emotions. It takes a lot of courage to share this with me. In those moments, can you remember any specific thoughts that come to mind?

User: I remember thinking things like, "I'll never succeed," or "Everyone else is better than me." These thoughts make me feel hopeless and lead to my more extreme reactions.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry, and they can certainly affect how you feel about yourself. Let's challenge those negative beliefs together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: I guess I have done well with projects and received compliments, but I just focus on the negatives more. 

Consultant: It's a common tendency to highlight the negatives while overlooking the positives. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them about their successes?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on what they've accomplished and remind them that everyone has their strengths.

Consultant: That's a really insightful approach! It seems like you have the capacity to recognize your achievements. How might you apply that same perspective to yourself when those negative thoughts come up?

User: I could try to remind myself of my accomplishments and that I've made new friends, which means I am capable of connecting with others.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Focusing on your strengths can be empowering. Let’s talk about what you can do when you start feeling overwhelmed. Are there any activities or coping strategies that help you feel better?

User: Sometimes I like to draw or listen to music, but when I’m really low, I usually just shut down.

Consultant: Engaging in drawing or listening to music are great outlets! When you feel low, maybe we can create a plan that includes these activities to help you get started? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. Having a plan might encourage me to do something instead of shutting down.

Consultant: Exactly! Let's explore how to build that plan. Would you be open to using a few minutes each day to draw or listen to music when you feel those negative emotions creeping in?

User: Yes, I can try that! It might help to remind myself of the things I enjoy.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember that every small step counts. In addition to this, we can also practice some breathing exercises to help you calm down when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to learn a quick technique?

User: Absolutely, I’d love that.

Consultant: Great! Let's try a simple breathing exercise together. You can start by taking a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let's do that a few times. 

User: (breathes in and out) That feels nice! I can see how it would help in a moment of stress.

Consultant: I'm glad you're enjoying it! The more you practice, the more natural it will feel to use this technique when you need it. How do you feel about incorporating this into your daily routine as well?

User: I think it could be helpful. It feels calming, and I’d like to give it a try.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's also consider the progress you've made. You’re managing to recognize positive experiences and finding ways to cope with negative feelings. What do you think has been your biggest achievement so far?

User: I think it’s been making new friends and being proud of our project together. It makes me feel like I’m not alone.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! It's all about connection and celebration. Moving forward, let’s think about how you can maintain those social interactions and keep affirming your worth in those relationships.

User: Yes, I think I will reach out to my friends more often. They really make me happy.

Consultant: That's a wonderful intention! Continue nurturing those connections. As we prepare to wrap up, what are some specific strategies you want to use going forward to maintain these positive changes?

User: I’ll practice recognizing my achievements, engage in art and music more, and use breathing exercises when I feel low. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! You have a clear route ahead. Remember, it’s okay to seek support when you need it. I'm proud of all the progress you've made. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my emotions now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, K! It's been a pleasure to see your growth. Today will be our last session for a while. Remember all the techniques we've discussed, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. 

User: Thank you so much! I’ll definitely remember what I’ve learned.

Consultant: Take care, K. I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and continue growing. Goodbye for now!
###################
Consultant: Hello, K! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit more stable, especially with my relationship with my dad improving. But I still have those moments where I feel low and sometimes I worry about it coming back.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear about the positive changes in your relationship with your dad. That’s a significant step forward! Let’s take some time to reflect on how you’ve been managing your emotions since then. Can you share more about those moments you worry about?

User: Sure. Sometimes, even when things seem okay, I can suddenly feel this heaviness inside, and it makes me want to isolate myself. I just don’t want to go back to how I was feeling before.

Consultant: It’s quite normal to have those feelings of heaviness, especially when things can feel uncertain. Since we last met, what strategies have you found helpful in dealing with those low feelings?

User: I’ve been trying to use the breathing exercises and journaling techniques we talked about. They help a bit, but I’m still unsure if I’m really improving.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Breathing exercises and journaling can be very effective tools. Let’s take a moment to explore your journaling—what kinds of thoughts or feelings have you been writing about lately?

User: I mostly write about my day-to-day experiences and how I feel about them. Sometimes, I also jot down things I’m grateful for, but when I’m low, it’s hard to think of positive things.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable—during tough times, finding positives can be challenging. Let’s focus on a time when you felt grateful. How did that moment feel for you, and what did you write about it?

User: I wrote about a day I spent with my dad. We went for a bike ride, and it felt nice to just enjoy that time together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely experience! It’s great to have those moments to reflect on. How did that positive experience influence your mood afterward?

User: It definitely lifted my spirits for that day. I wish I could feel that way all the time.

Consultant: I can see how that would be a wonderful feeling to hold on to. It’s important to remember that it’s okay to have fluctuations in emotions. Let’s work on some techniques to help you seek out those uplifting experiences. How can we integrate more of them into your routine?

User: Maybe I could plan more activities with my dad? I think that would help.

Consultant: Planning more activities sounds like a great idea! It can create a sense of anticipation and joy. What types of activities would you enjoy doing together?

User: We both like hiking. I think going for more hikes could be really refreshing.

Consultant: Hiking is a fantastic choice! Not only does it allow for quality time, but it also brings the added benefits of nature and physical activity. Could we set a goal for how often you’d like to hike together in the upcoming weeks?

User: Maybe we could aim for once a week? That sounds manageable.

Consultant: Once a week is a wonderful goal. Having that regular activity can be a nice anchor for your week. Alongside this, how can we further support your emotional well-being during the days when you might feel heavier?

User: I think I need to remind myself about the breathing exercises more often. I sometimes forget to do them.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Creating small reminders to practice your breathing exercises can be helpful. Would you like to develop a simple daily routine that includes these practices?

User: Yeah, I would definitely like that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s come up with a manageable routine you can follow. How about starting with a breathing exercise for a few minutes in the morning and journaling about your feelings in the evening?

User: That could work. I have a bit more energy in the morning anyway.

Consultant: Perfect! Morning breathing to set a positive tone for the day and journaling in the evening to reflect on your feelings could be a nice balance. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel good about it! It makes me feel a bit more in control.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Feeling in control over your routine is an important part of building stability. As we continue to work together, let’s also explore how you can recognize when those heavy feelings arise and what you can do in those moments.

User: That sounds helpful! I often don’t really notice until I’m already feeling down.

Consultant: Recognizing those feelings is the first step. We can work on developing awareness of your emotional triggers. Are there specific situations or thoughts that usually precede those low moods?

User: Sometimes it’s just stressful days at school that get to me. I guess I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s common for school stress to impact your mood. When these stressful days happen, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough or that I’ll mess things up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to carry. Let’s talk about challenging those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? 

User: I mean, sometimes I do mess up on tests, but then I also have days where I do well!

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a mix of experiences. It’s important to remember that everyone has successes and setbacks. What if we reframed your thoughts to celebrate your achievements rather than focusing on the mistakes? 

User: That makes sense. I should probably focus more on what I do well.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s practice this shift in thinking. Can you recall a specific achievement that made you feel proud recently?

User: I did well in my last science project! I worked really hard on it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! Acknowledging your hard work is crucial. What would it feel like to remind yourself of this success during times of doubt?

User: I think it would help a lot to remember that I can do well too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of these achievements can help counteract those negative thoughts. Let's create a space in your journal just for celebrating your successes. How does that sound?

User: I really like that idea! 

Consultant: Great! We’re making excellent progress, K. As we approach the end of our session, let's reflect on what we've worked on today. How do you feel about your current emotional strategies?

User: I feel more confident about having a plan and being able to work on my feelings.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As you continue with your new routine and focus on your achievements, you’ll build a stronger awareness and confidence. 

User: I’m looking forward to implementing everything!

Consultant: I’m proud of you, K! Keep practicing these strategies, and remember, I’m here if you need further guidance. What can we discuss in our next session to continue this journey? 

User: Maybe we can check in on how my routine is going and talk more about handling school stress.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll dive into that. Have a great week ahead, and I look forward to hearing about your progress! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, 小K! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. My mood has improved, and I've been managing my stress better since we talked about my issues. But I still want to make sure I can handle things on my own moving forward.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that your mood has improved! It sounds like you've made significant progress in managing your stress. Can you share more about what strategies have worked well for you?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to apply the breathing exercises we discussed. They really help when I feel overwhelmed. I also started keeping a journal to track my feelings and reflect on how I'm doing.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Journaling can be a powerful way to gain insight into your thoughts and emotions. How has journaling helped you so far?

User: It helps me understand my emotions better. Sometimes I notice patterns in what triggers my anxiety or low mood, and writing it down makes it less overwhelming.

Consultant: That's insightful! Recognizing those patterns is an important step. Now that you've built some tools for yourself, how do you feel about the idea of facing any potential triggers in the future?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, honestly. Sometimes the thought of facing those triggers feels daunting, even with my new strategies.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about facing triggers. Would you like to explore how we can make facing those situations feel more manageable for you?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to feel more confident in handling challenges when they come up.

Consultant: Great! We can create a plan that gradually introduces you to those triggers, allowing you to practice your coping strategies in a supportive way. How do you feel about setting small goals for this?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think starting small might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! We can start with something you feel is moderately challenging. What is one situation you've identified that you feel ready to address?

User: I think maybe talking to someone new at school would be a good start. I often feel really anxious in social situations.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive goal! How about we brainstorm some approaches you could take to engage in that situation? 

User: Maybe I could start by just saying hello to someone in my class. Just keeping it simple.

Consultant: That's a fantastic starting point! Saying hello is a great way to connect. How do you think you would feel after doing that?

User: I might feel a bit proud if I actually do it. But I worry that I might stumble over my words or that they won't respond well.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns. It’s perfectly normal to have those worries. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. If you stumbled, it’s part of the learning process. What if we created a positive affirmation you could say to yourself before trying this?

User: That could help! Maybe something like, "It's okay to be myself. I can handle this."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Repeating that to yourself can definitely help boost your confidence. How can you remind yourself to use it before these social interactions?

User: I could write it on a sticky note and put it in my journal, so I see it before school.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! It keeps it visible and reminds you to focus on your self-acceptance. As you approach this goal, how do you feel about tracking your experiences afterward in your journal?

User: I can definitely do that. It would be good to see how I felt before and after.

Consultant: Exactly, reflecting will help you assess your feelings and progress. If you notice any negative thoughts cropping up, remember we can work on challenging those as you have learned. How do you feel about using your journal as a tool for this?

User: That makes sense. I feel like the journal can help me identify those negative thoughts when they come up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can provide you with a safe space to express those thoughts and emotions. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to reflect on the progress you’ve made and how you can maintain these strategies moving forward.

User: Sure! I've recognized more about my emotions and learned coping strategies, and now I have a plan to talk to someone new. That feels like a lot of progress.

Consultant: It certainly is! You’ve shown remarkable growth, and it’s important to acknowledge that. How do you envision carrying these strategies into your everyday life after our sessions conclude?

User: I think I can keep applying what I've learned. Just reminding myself to stay positive and being kind to myself when I face challenges.

Consultant: That's a perfect mindset! Remember, you're equipped with tools that can help maintain balance when challenges arise. If you ever feel you need extra support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve done an amazing job during our time together.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and support.
