Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I’m glad to see you again today. I know you’ve been struggling with some difficult feelings and dreams lately. Can you share with me how you’ve been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been having terrible nightmares almost every night. They’re really graphic and make me feel like someone is out to hurt me. It’s exhausting. And when I’m at school, I find it hard to talk to anyone. I feel so alone.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhenzhen. Nightmares can be very distressing, and it makes sense that they would affect how you feel during the day. Let’s start by talking about your dreams. What thoughts go through your mind when you wake up from one of those nightmares?

User: I feel scared and like I can't trust anyone. It’s like the dream sticks with me, and I’m afraid it might happen in real life.

Consultant: I understand why you’d feel that way after such vivid dreams. It can be hard to shake off that fear. Do you think there's a connection between what you dream and how you feel about school and your friends?

User: Yes, I think so. I feel really anxious about being at school. I worry that my classmates won’t like me or will make fun of me. It’s hard to talk to them.

Consultant: That makes sense. You’re dealing with both the impact of those scary dreams and the anxiety about social interactions. Let's focus on your thoughts regarding social situations. Can you tell me more about the kinds of thoughts you have when you're about to talk to someone?

User: I start thinking they might think I’m weird or laugh at me. I usually just end up saying nothing or avoiding them.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It’s really common to have such fears. Let's examine them a little closer. What evidence do you have that your classmates think you’re weird or would laugh at you?

User: Well, sometimes I hear them whispering, but I’m not sure what they’re saying. It just makes me feel really self-conscious.

Consultant: I see. It’s natural to feel uneasy when we think people are whispering about us. But could that be a misunderstanding? What if they are talking about something unrelated? 

User: That’s possible, but I can’t help but feel like it’s about me. I feel isolated, like I'm on the outside looking in.

Consultant: Isolation can be very painful. It’s understandable to want to protect yourself from those feelings. If a friend were feeling the same way, how would you advise them to look at the situation instead?

User: I’d probably tell them that they should try talking to those people instead of avoiding them. Maybe they’re not as bad as they seem.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It shows you have an understanding of how to approach social situations. Would you be willing to experiment with that advice for yourself?

User: I guess I could try talking to someone. But what if they really don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: It's normal to have that fear. However, remember that most people appreciate it when someone tries to engage with them. Let’s create a small plan: how about starting with a simple greeting or compliment when you see someone? It doesn’t have to be anything big.

User: Okay, I could try saying “hi” to someone. But I’m still worried about how they’ll react.

Consultant: It’s all right to feel worried! Let’s keep in mind that you are taking a brave step. Whatever their reaction, you are still building your confidence. We can discuss any feelings or thoughts that come up after you try it.

User: That sounds okay. I just hope I don’t freeze up.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel apprehensive. Prepare yourself for various outcomes. If you do feel frozen, that’s okay too; you’ll learn from the experience. Would you like to set a time when we can check in on how it went?

User: Yes, we could talk about it next week? I’ll try to say hi to at least one person.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m proud of you for setting that goal. How do you feel about what we’ve talked about today? 

User: I feel a little less anxious about it. I think having a plan helps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can make things seem more manageable. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. It's okay to take gradual steps.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'll try to remember that.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhenzhen. Let’s keep building on this progress in our next session. Remember that change takes time, and you’re already taking positive steps forward. 

User: I will. See you next week!

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, Zhenzhen.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today, Zhenzhen. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit low. I participated in a class activity recently, but I struggled with the interactions, and it's left me feeling pretty frustrated and not confident.

Consultant: I understand that interacting didn't go as well as you hoped, which can be tough. Can you share a bit more about what happened during that activity?

User: Well, I wanted to join in, but when it was time to speak, I froze up. I felt like everyone was watching me, and I just couldn't say anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt very self-conscious in that moment. It’s completely normal to feel that way in a social setting. When you think about that experience, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I just keep thinking that I'm really awkward and that nobody wants to hear what I have to say. It makes me want to avoid situations like that.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming, Zhenzhen. Let's explore them together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're awkward or that people don't want to hear you?

User: I guess I don't have solid proof. It's just how I feel. Sometimes, I see my classmates joking around, and I can't keep up.

Consultant: It's interesting to note that your feelings might not reflect reality. Sometimes, it can be easy to assume others are critical or unkind. If a friend shared this feeling of being awkward, what might you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them they are doing great and that they shouldn’t worry about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a supportive and encouraging approach! It’s helpful to remember that often our fears are more intense than the actual situation. Would you be willing to practice thinking more positively about your abilities? 

User: Yes, I think that might help. But I’m still scared of failing when I try.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel scared, especially when trying new things. How about we identify small steps you could take to gradually face these social situations while building confidence?

User: That sounds okay. Maybe I can start by speaking up once during the next class? 

Consultant: That’s a great first step! Setting a small goal like that can be helpful. What’s one thing you could tell yourself to encourage yourself in that moment?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: I love that positive affirmation! Acknowledging that mistakes are part of the learning process is key. How can we prepare for that next class so you feel even more ready?

User: Maybe I could jot down a few points I want to share. That way, I’ll feel less pressure.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparing beforehand can give you a sense of control and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about practicing some of these interaction scenarios with me right now?

User: Sure, I think that would help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s say we’re in class now, and I just asked a question about the last assignment. What would you respond?

User: I guess I’d say... “I found it challenging, but I learned a lot about teamwork."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful response! It shows reflection and positive engagement. What would it feel like to say that in class?

User: I think I’d feel a bit nervous, but maybe also proud of myself for participating.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic balance! Remember, feeling a little nervous is common, but you can focus on that pride in contributing. Shall we try another scenario?

User: Yes, let’s do it!

Consultant: Wonderful! Imagine now that a classmate asks for your opinion on a group project. What would you say?

User: I’d probably say, “I think it’s going well, but I’d like to hear everyone else’s thoughts too.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! You validate your own thoughts while also inviting others to share. Creating this dialogue can make interactions feel less daunting. Do you feel any differences in your confidence while practicing?

User: Yes, it does feel easier to think through it when I'm practicing like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, practice will enhance your comfort over time. Before we finish today, what’s one thing you’d like to take away from our session?

User: I think I want to focus on being kinder to myself and practicing small interactions. 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful takeaway, Zhenzhen. Fostering kindness toward yourself will be a great asset as you navigate these social situations. I'm here to support you in this journey. How about we plan to revisit this next time we meet?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for helping me today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, each small step counts. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been really anxious because the mid-term exams are approaching. I can't shake off the worry about not meeting expectations, and I just feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling a lot of pressure right now. It's completely normal to feel anxious when exams are coming up. Can you tell me more about how this anxiety has been affecting your daily life or your study habits?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate, and sometimes I just stare at my books for hours without making any progress. It makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It seems like this anxiety is making your study time feel unproductive, which can be discouraging. Have you noticed any specific thoughts running through your mind when you find it hard to concentrate?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't do well on these exams, I'll disappoint my teachers and my grandparents. It's like a loop that I can't get out of.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound intense, and it's understandable to worry about disappointing others. Let's explore these feelings together. What do you think would happen if you didn't meet those expectations?

User: I guess I would feel really bad about myself. I’ve already struggled a lot, and failing would just make everything worse.

Consultant: It seems like a lot of weight is on your shoulders. Can we look at those thoughts of failure together? Is there any evidence that supports the idea that one exam defines your worth?

User: Not really. I mean, I know that my grandparents love me no matter what, but the fear of failure is still there.

Consultant: You're absolutely right; your self-worth isn't defined by an exam. Let’s try to challenge that fear a bit more. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them to think about this situation?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to try their best and that one exam doesn't define them. 

Consultant: That's a great perspective! You're able to provide that kindness to someone else, and it’s important to extend that same compassion to yourself. What if we worked on reminding yourself of that when those anxious thoughts arise?

User: That sounds helpful, but I’m not sure I can believe it when I'm really anxious.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. What if we practiced some techniques to help ground you in those moments of anxiety? Should we explore a few strategies to help you manage those feelings?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to feel less anxious.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can use is mindfulness. It’s a way to bring your focus to the present moment. Would you be willing to try a simple mindfulness exercise with me?

User: Sure, I’m willing to give it a try.

Consultant: Let’s start by taking a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly. As you breathe, focus on how your body feels. What do you notice?

User: I feel a bit lighter, but my thoughts keep trying to pull me back to the worries.

Consultant: That’s quite common! When thoughts come in, rather than pushing them away, we can acknowledge them. You might say to yourself, “I notice I’m feeling anxious right now,” and then redirect your focus to your breathing. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. I think I can try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! This kind of practice can really help reinforce a sense of calm. Do you think you could commit to spending a few minutes each day on this mindfulness exercise?

User: Yes, I can do that. I want to try anything that might help.

Consultant: That's a positive attitude! Along with mindfulness, we can discuss planning your study sessions to make them more manageable. How much time do you think you can dedicate each day to your studies?

User: Maybe like two hours each day, but I always seem to get distracted.

Consultant: Let’s break it down. How about we create a structured plan with smaller goals within those two hours? For example, you could focus for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Does that sound doable?

User: Yeah, I could try that. It feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: Perfect! This approach can help you build momentum and ensure you're taking breaks, which is essential. We can also explore what activities you enjoy during those breaks to recharge your mind. 

User: I like listening to music and drawing. 

Consultant: Those sound like great ways to relax! Incorporating those activities into your breaks can make the study sessions more enjoyable. What do you think about that?

User: I think it could help keep me motivated. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s important to reward yourself for your hard work. As we plan these sessions, let’s also take a moment to reflect on your progress. What small wins have you experienced, even amidst challenges?

User: I guess I’ve been able to start studying earlier instead of procrastinating.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! Recognizing progress, no matter how small, is vital. How does that make you feel about your ability to handle these upcoming exams?

User: It gives me a bit of hope that I can manage things better.

Consultant: That's a great realization! Hope is such a powerful tool. As we move forward, let's also ensure you have strategies ready for when anxiety spikes. What do you think would be helpful for you?

User: Maybe reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes might help me when I start to feel really anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Remember, making mistakes is part of learning. You might also consider repeating to yourself, “I am doing my best, and that's enough.” Can you commit to using that affirmation when you sense anxiety creeping in?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Fantastic, Zhenzhen! You've made great strides today. As we wrap up, what are the key takeaways you’d like to focus on for the next session?

User: I want to practice mindfulness and stick to my study plan while reminding myself that I’m enough no matter the outcome.

Consultant: Those are powerful intentions! I believe you have the tools and mindset to make progress. Remember, I’m here to support you. You can always reach out if you need help. I look forward to seeing you next time and hearing about your experiences!

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you're starting to become more open to exploring ways to manage your emotions. What has led to this change in your perspective?

User: Hi! I recently participated in a mental health education class at school, and it made me curious about different ways to regulate my emotions. I realized I want to learn how to feel better and cope with things that stress me out.

Consultant: That's a great start, Zhenzhen! It's positive to see you're interested in emotional regulation. Can you share what specific emotions or situations you've been finding challenging lately?

User: Mostly, I feel anxious and overwhelmed when I think about school assignments or social situations. Sometimes it feels like too much to handle, and I just want to escape.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings can be really intense for you. When you think about those stressful situations, what thoughts come to your mind that might be contributing to that anxiety?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "No one will want to talk to me." Those thoughts make me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It seems like they create a cycle of anxiety for you. Let's explore them a bit. How true do you think those thoughts are? Do you have any evidence that supports or disputes them?

User: I guess I don't always fail, and I've made some friends. But when I get anxious, it's hard to remember the times I've succeeded or the good times with my friends.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Zhenzhen. Perhaps we can work on recognizing those accomplishments more often to challenge those negative thoughts. What do you think might help you remember those positive experiences when anxiety hits?

User: Maybe I could write them down or have a list of things I’ve done well. That way, I could refer to it when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Keeping a list of your accomplishments can serve as a helpful reminder. Would you like to set a small goal to create that list by our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful! I’d also like to learn some techniques for calming down when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! One technique we could try is deep breathing. It can help calm your body and mind when anxiety arises. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Sure, I'd like to try that! How does it work?

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment. Sit comfortably and close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold for a count of four… and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. We can repeat that a few times.

User: Okay, I'll try that… Inhaling… holding… exhaling. 

Consultant: How does that feel for you?

User: I feel a bit calmer already! It's nice to focus on my breathing instead of my racing thoughts.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this technique regularly can help you create a calming habit over time. Would you like to set a plan for practicing deep breathing daily?

User: Yes, I think I could try it for a few minutes every day, especially when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Perfect! Having a routine can be very beneficial. Is there a specific time each day that you think would be best for you to practice this?

User: Maybe in the morning before school? That might help me start the day off better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Morning practice can set a positive tone for your day. Along with that, would you like to incorporate any mindfulness exercises as well?

User: I’d be interested in that! What kind of exercises are there?

Consultant: Mindfulness involves being present in the moment. One simple exercise is to take a few minutes to notice your surroundings—what you see, hear, or feel. Would you like to try that now?

User: Okay, I’ll try to focus on the sounds around me. It feels a bit strange, but also nice.

Consultant: That's perfectly normal! It takes time to get used to mindfulness practices. You did well! Remember, it’s about observing without judgment. You could incorporate this exercise into your daily routine too. 

User: I will definitely try to notice more around me. I think it could help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: Absolutely! You're making wonderful progress in learning these new techniques. As a recap, you've identified negative thoughts, created a plan for your accomplishments, and practiced deep breathing and mindfulness. How do you feel about this progress?

User: I feel good! I didn’t think I could learn so much in one session. It gives me hope that I can manage my emotions better.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Zhenzhen! Your openness to these techniques shows great strength. Remember, it’s all about being patient and practicing. How do you feel moving forward from here?

User: I feel cautiously optimistic! I want to keep practicing and maybe talk about my experiences next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I'm looking forward to hearing about how these techniques are working for you. You've done so well today. If you ever need support in between sessions, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhenzhen! Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhenzhen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling overall better, but sometimes I get anxious about schoolwork and how I interact with others.

Consultant: It's great to hear that overall you're feeling better. Anxieties about school and social interactions are quite common, especially being a student. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically makes you anxious?

User: I worry a lot about my grades and if I'm fitting in well with my classmates. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not good enough.

Consultant: I can see how that would be difficult for you, worrying about grades and fitting in. Let's explore this a little more. When you think about not being good enough, what thoughts come up for you?

User: I often think that if I don't get good grades, my family will be disappointed, and I’ll be left out of conversations with my friends.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful. It seems like you put a lot of pressure on yourself to meet those expectations. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel overwhelmed and sometimes sad. I just want to be able to enjoy school and my friends without all this pressure.

Consultant: That's completely understandable, wanting to enjoy school and friendships without feeling burdened. Let’s take a moment here: can you think of any specific situation recently where you felt that pressure?

User: Yes, last week during a group project, I felt so stressed about my contribution and if it was good enough. I kept thinking they would judge me.

Consultant: That’s a significant moment to reflect on. During that project, what specific thoughts were you having that contributed to your stress? 

User: I thought things like, “What if they think I'm the weakest link?” or “What if I mess up and let everyone down?”

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty heavy, and it's easy to understand how they could impact your anxiety during the project. Do you think these thoughts are based on solid evidence, or might they be a bit extreme?

User: I guess they are a bit extreme. Most of my classmates were actually supportive, but in that moment, I couldn’t see it clearly.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Zhenzhen. It seems like your mind tends to emphasize the negatives despite the support around you. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell her?

User: I would probably tell her that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not be perfect. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

Consultant: Exactly! You just recognized something very valuable. It sounds like you have a supportive perspective to offer, but it's harder to apply to yourself at times. How could you practice that self-compassion you’d offer a friend when those anxious thoughts come up?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive things about myself or remind myself that it's okay to ask questions in class if I don't know something.

Consultant: Those are thoughtful strategies. Writing down your strengths and affirmations could be a great reminder. How about we explore other activities that could help you feel more confident in school and with your friends?

User: I like that idea! Maybe I can try joining a club or something to get more comfortable with people.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! It could help you connect with others outside of the academic pressure and have fun. What kinds of clubs interest you?

User: I’m really interested in art, so maybe an art club or something creative.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging in something you love could be a great way to relieve some pressure while building friendships. Could we set a small goal for you this week related to that?

User: Yes! I could look up clubs at school and maybe attend the first meeting. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Zhenzhen! Remember, it’s about enjoying the process and connecting with others. How does it feel to have that plan in place?

User: It feels good! I’m excited but also a little nervous. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel excited yet nervous. Just take one step at a time. How can you remind yourself to stay calm if those anxious thoughts pop up as you go?

User: I think I could take a few deep breaths or remind myself that it's just about having fun, not about being perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely, deep breaths can be very grounding, and focusing on enjoyment instead of perfection is a healthy approach. As we review our session today, what key takeaways do you feel you’ve gained?

User: I feel like I can be kinder to myself and focus on enjoying my experiences, not just stressing about them.

Consultant: That's a beautiful insight, Zhenzhen! You've made significant progress in understanding your thoughts and feelings today. As we wrap up, how do you plan to carry this learning into your daily life?

User: I’ll try to remind myself to be more positive and take things one step at a time, especially when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I'm proud of your progress and the strategies you’ve developed. Remember, it's okay to reach out if you need support. I look forward to hearing how things go next time we meet. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to improving!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhenzhen. I'm here to support you as you continue this journey. Have a wonderful week ahead, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Zhenzhen! It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite relieved, actually. The pressure from exams is gone, and I am pretty satisfied with my results. It feels nice to finally relax a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress with your studies and emotions. Can you share a bit more about how your family has been doing as well?

User: Family life has been great! We’ve been spending more time together, and there’s been a lot of laughter at home lately. I really appreciate that.

Consultant: That’s heartwarming to hear! A supportive family can make such a big difference. Since you’re feeling more stable emotionally and your relationships are improving, what would you like to focus on during our session today?

User: I guess I want to talk about how to maintain this stability and continue to feel good, especially as I transition into the next school term.

Consultant: Absolutely, maintaining your progress is crucial. Let’s explore how you can sustain this positive emotional state as you go back to school. What specific challenges do you think you might face in the upcoming term?

User: I worry a little about the new subjects and assignments. Even though I did well, I still sometimes feel anxious about keeping up with everything.

Consultant: That’s a realistic concern, especially with new challenges ahead. Have you experienced any particular thoughts or feelings of anxiety related to school in the past?

User: Yes, I remember feeling overwhelmed whenever I thought about the workload. Sometimes it felt like I wouldn’t be able to handle it all.

Consultant: I understand that. It’s common to feel overwhelmed when facing new responsibilities. When those anxious thoughts arise, what sort of emotional impact do they usually have on you?

User: They make me feel kind of trapped and wanting to escape from studying. I just want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a strong urge to avoid your studies, which can feel really difficult. In the moment, could you identify any specific thoughts that pop into your mind when you consider your workload?

User: I often think, “What if I can't keep up?” or “What if everyone else does better than me?” Those thoughts make me feel really anxious.

Consultant: Those are powerful thoughts, and it's understandable they would cause anxiety. Let’s take a moment to challenge those ideas. What evidence do you have that you won't be able to keep up or that others will do better?

User: Well, I did well in my last exams, so I guess I have some proof that I can manage. But those “what ifs” are hard to shake off.

Consultant: You're absolutely right; your past performance shows you have the capability to succeed. Let's consider alternative thoughts you might have. How might you reframe those “what if” statements?

User: Instead of focusing on “What if I can't keep up?”, maybe I could think, “I have done well before; I can plan my time and ask for help if I need it.”

Consultant: That's an excellent reframe! It emphasizes your strengths and resources, which is crucial. As you prepare for the new term, what steps can you take to keep this positive mindset?

User: I think I’ll start making a study schedule and keep in touch with my teachers if I find something tough. That way, I won’t feel alone in it.

Consultant: Great plan! A study schedule can definitely help manage your workload while reaching out for support is a proactive approach. How do you feel about implementing these strategies?

User: I feel excited and a bit more in control. Having a plan helps ease my anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's empowering to feel in control of your journey. Moving forward, how can you ensure you maintain this balance between studying and leisure?

User: I think I should plan fun activities after completing my study goals each week. It would motivate me to stay focused.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Balancing work with leisure can definitely enhance your overall well-being. Is there anything specific you have in mind for those fun activities?

User: Maybe I could start reading new books or go out with friends more often. It’s been a while since we all hung out.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ideas! Having social connections and engaging in enjoyable activities can boost your mood and overall mental health. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I feel that I now have some practical strategies to manage my studies without the anxiety. I can lean on my family and friends, too.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! You've made significant progress, Zhenzhen. Remember that it’s okay to seek support when you need it. I’m confident you can maintain this positivity. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, we can always revisit these strategies together.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more prepared and less worried about going back to school now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear you’re feeling more prepared. I hope you carry this newfound confidence into the coming term. If anything comes up, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself!

User: I will! Thank you again for the help. 

Consultant: Goodbye, Zhenzhen! I look forward to hearing about your progress in the next session.
