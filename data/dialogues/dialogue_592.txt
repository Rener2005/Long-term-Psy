Consultant: Hello, I'm really glad to see you today, A. I know you might have a lot on your mind currently. Can you share what’s been bothering you lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really confused about my involvement in that scam. I regret it mainly because it affected my friends, but I don’t fully grasp how serious it really is.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a mix of regret and confusion about your actions. That’s completely understandable. Let's explore this feeling a bit more. What thoughts are coming to your mind when you reflect on these events?

User: I keep thinking that I shouldn't have gotten involved at all, but I also feel like it wasn't entirely my fault. I just didn't think it would have such a big impact.

Consultant: It’s common to have conflicting thoughts in a situation like this. On one hand, there’s regret, and on the other, you’re questioning your responsibility. Can you tell me more about why you see it as not entirely your fault?

User: I guess I felt pressured to participate, and I thought it would just be a fun way to earn some money. I didn’t think we were hurting anyone directly.

Consultant: It’s clear you felt some external pressure, and that can be tough to navigate. But if we look closely, do you think there could be a difference between your intentions and the actual outcomes of that decision?

User: Yeah, I see your point. My intentions might not have been harmful, but the consequences ended up affecting people negatively. I just feel stuck between wanting to do better and feeling ashamed.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, A. Shame can often hold us back from making positive changes. If you could look at this situation from a more compassionate perspective, what would you want to say to a friend who finds themselves in a similar position?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes, and that it's important to learn from them. I guess I should be a bit kinder to myself too.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy way to approach it. Learning from our mistakes can help us grow. What do you think would be a productive step for you moving forward from here, especially regarding your education?

User: I’m not sure… I feel kind of lost about school. I just want to forget everything and start fresh, but I know that’s not really possible.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want a fresh start, but education is still valuable. What if we took a moment to rethink how education could play a role in your life now? How could it potentially help you in the future?

User: I guess I see it could open up more opportunities for me, but I also feel overwhelmed about going back to school after everything that happened.

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed is a normal reaction when thinking about returning to school. Perhaps we could break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. What small step do you think you could take to ease back into the idea of school?

User: Maybe I can reach out to a teacher I trust and talk about what I’ve been going through. I haven’t had any contact with school since everything happened.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Connecting with someone you trust could provide you with support and guidance. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit scared, but I think it could help me feel more grounded. I guess I just have to be honest about how I feel.

Consultant: Honesty can be very liberating, and it can help build understanding. When you think about this conversation you’ll have with your teacher, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I think it might be a relief to share my feelings and possibly get some advice. But I worry they might judge me for my past.

Consultant: Those fears are valid. We often worry about being judged, especially when discussing our struggles. What if we approached this conversation with a mindset focused on growth and learning? How might that change your perspective?

User: If I think about it that way, it’s less about being judged and more about seeking help. That could make it easier for me to talk.

Consultant: Exactly! Viewing it as a step towards your growth shifts the focus from judgment to support. How do you feel about setting a timeline for when you might reach out to your teacher?

User: I think I could aim to do it by the end of this week. That gives me a little time to prepare but not too much to procrastinate.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! And remember, preparing yourself by reflecting on what you want to say can help ease any nerves you may have. How are you feeling about this decision now?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. It’s still intimidating, but I think having a plan helps a lot. I want to change things for the better.

Consultant: Hope is a great feeling to embrace as you move forward. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think your biggest takeaway is?

User: I think it's really about learning to forgive myself and taking small steps toward improvement. I see now that education is important and I value it more than I did before.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, A. Acknowledging self-forgiveness and valuing education are significant steps in your journey. I'm proud of the insight you've gained. Just remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. You’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I really needed this encouragement.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm glad to have you here today. I know you've been reflecting on your current situation. Can you share with me what thoughts you have around your education lately?

User: Hi. I've been thinking about how I'm not studying right now, and I feel really confused. I know education is important, but I just can't bring myself to care about it. It feels pointless.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel conflicted about this. It sounds like you recognize the value of education, yet there's a part of you that feels disconnected from it. Let’s explore this confusion together. What specifically makes you feel that education is pointless?

User: I just feel like I won’t be successful anyway, so why bother? I see my parents working so hard, but I'm not even sure what I want to do with my life.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It's hard to navigate when you're not sure about your future or feel pressure from your parents. Can you tell me about a time when you did feel engaged or inspired by something related to learning?

User: Well, there was a time when I found a topic I liked in science. I got really into it, but it didn’t last long. The moment I found something hard, I just gave up again.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that experience. It seems like there was a spark of interest there, but challenges made it tough for you to keep going. What do you think would help you rekindle that interest in learning?

User: I don’t know…maybe if I could just find something I like, it would be easier? But it’s hard to stay motivated.

Consultant: Finding a topic that engages you could definitely make a difference! Let's think of it this way: if we could break learning down into smaller, manageable tasks, what do you think you could be willing to try? 

User: Maybe I could try looking into a few science experiments or something like that. It just feels hard to start.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Starting small can make things feel less overwhelming. How about we set a very small goal for yourself this week, perhaps watching one science video and jotting down what you liked about it? 

User: That sounds doable. I could try that. It just feels like it won’t matter in the big picture.

Consultant: It’s natural to think about the big picture, but every small step can lead to bigger changes over time. Completing that small task might give you a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself?

User: I think I might feel a bit good if I can do it. I just hope I don’t get distracted trying to do other things.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Perhaps we can come up with a plan to limit distractions while you watch. For example, setting a specific time in a quiet space. What do you think about that? 

User: That could work. I just need to make sure I do it when I'm focused.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being intentional about when and where you choose to learn can help you stay engaged. Let’s also think about how you'll feel once you've accomplished your goal. What do you anticipate that feeling might be like?

User: I guess I’d feel a little proud of myself… maybe more confident?

Consultant: Exactly! That feeling of pride and confidence can reinforce your motivation to keep going. As you complete small tasks, it can build a sense of purpose. How does that sound to you? 

User: It sounds good, but I still wonder if I’ll just end up giving up like before.

Consultant: That's understandable, but remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Each step counts, and if you encounter challenges, we can always troubleshoot together. Would that provide some reassurance?

User: Yeah, I think it would help if I know I can talk about it if I get stuck.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having support can make a huge difference. As we work towards these small goals, let’s also remind ourselves of what you value about learning. What do you think education could provide you in the future?

User: I guess it could help me have more opportunities and maybe even find something I’m passionate about.

Consultant: Absolutely! Education can open many doors and lead you to discover your passions. Let’s keep that in mind as you work through your tasks. It can serve as your motivation. 

User: I’ll try to remember that. Setting those goals feels less scary now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s about taking those small steps and enjoying the process along the way. Do you feel a bit more positive about starting to engage with learning now?

User: Yeah, I do! I think I’m ready to give it a shot.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, little A! Let’s plan to check in on how this goes next time. I’m excited to hear about what you discover. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m really glad you’re feeling hopeful. It’s a big step toward moving forward. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need to talk. Good luck with your small goal, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello there! I’m really glad to see you today. To start off, could you share how you’ve been feeling about your courses lately? 

User: Hi! I actually feel a bit excited about some of the courses I’ve taken recently, but I’m still really hesitant about full-time study. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling some excitement about your courses. What specific aspects of these courses do you find exciting? 

User: I liked the hands-on projects in the short courses. They made me feel successful and engaged, which is something I really miss in traditional classes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Experiencing success in your learning can be really empowering. Can you tell me more about what kind of projects you enjoyed? 

User: I enjoyed a science project where we got to build a small model. It felt rewarding to see it come together, but then thinking about doing that every day in school makes me anxious.

Consultant: I can see how that contrast can create mixed feelings. It sounds like the hands-on projects ignited some positive feelings, yet the idea of returning to a traditional learning setup brings anxiety. What do you think makes the daily school routine feel so daunting for you?

User: I think it’s mostly the pressure. I have a hard time with subjects like math, and I worry about not being able to keep up or failing again.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Pressure can really weigh heavily, especially when past experiences have influenced your confidence. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that come to mind when you think about school or math?

User: I often think, “I’ll never get it” or “I’m just going to fail again.” Those thoughts make everything worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty limiting. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that you will fail? Is there a chance that there might be alternative outcomes? 

User: Well, I guess not all of my experiences have been failures. I did well in some subjects last year, but I'm just afraid I’ll revert back to my old struggles.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re recognizing past successes! It’s completely natural to have fears about slipping back into old patterns. However, we can work together to build strategies that could help you face those challenges. Would you be open to trying some small experiments to make studying feel more manageable?

User: Yes, I would like that! But I'm not sure what kind of experiments we could do.

Consultant: A simple start could be trying to set small, daily goals for study. For example, picking one topic each day that interests you and spending a short time working on it. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I could focus on one part of math or something I found interesting from the course.

Consultant: Exactly! And after you complete your goal, take note of how you feel about it. This might help you identify positive experiences and counter some of those anxiety-provoking thoughts. 

User: I like that idea. It feels less scary than a big push to study everything at once.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to break things down into smaller steps. Let’s discuss how you can reflect on your feelings after each goal. Do you think writing it down or discussing it with someone might help?

User: Writing it down sounds good. I can keep a journal and maybe share my progress with a friend.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Sharing it could also create accountability and make you feel more connected. How do you feel about your family being part of this journey? 

User: I haven’t really talked to my parents much about my studies. I guess I’ve been avoiding it.

Consultant: That’s understandable, especially with past experiences. But involving them could provide you with additional support. What if we worked on ways you could initiate that conversation?

User: I think I need to figure out how to approach them. Maybe I could start by telling them I’m interested in trying new things with my studies.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! You could express your excitement about the courses and how you’re thinking of changing your study habits. What do you think they would react?

User: I think they might be supportive, but I just worry they’ll expect too much from me again.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, given your past experiences. However, setting the tone that you’re exploring new paths might help them understand where you are now. Would it be helpful for you to rehearse what you’d like to say to them?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Having something prepared might ease my anxiety. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Let’s role-play a bit. How would you start the conversation about your new interests in learning with them? 

User: I could say something like, “Hey, I’ve been thinking about my studies and would like to share some ideas I have.”

Consultant: That's a strong opener! Adding that you discovered some things you enjoy might lead to a more positive discussion. What do you hope to achieve from this conversation?

User: I hope they’ll listen and understand that I’m trying to change and need their support rather than pressure.

Consultant: That’s a very clear intention and a healthy way to approach it. Remember, it’s about collaboration. In our next session, we can discuss how the talk went and reflect on their responses. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good! I feel a bit more optimistic now about talking to them.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! We’ll keep building on these feelings. Just remember, you’re taking steps toward building the support you need. Keep me updated on your goals and conversations. You’re doing great! 

User: Thank you! I feel more encouraged to take these steps.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. It’s all about taking small steps forward. Looking forward to our next session. Until then, take care!

Consultant: Hello, A! I'm really glad to see you again today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned wanting to improve communication with your parents and understood how it could help you. How have you been feeling about that since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about our conversation. I still feel nervous about talking to my parents, but I know it’s important. I want to try discussing my future plans with them.

Consultant: That's a great step forward! It's normal to feel nervous, but it sounds like you recognize the value in those conversations. What specific future plans do you want to discuss with your parents?

User: I want to talk about my interest in going back to school and what subjects I might want to study. I really don’t know how to bring it up, though.

Consultant: That’s an excellent topic to discuss! It helps to have a plan for how to start the conversation. Do you think it would help if we role-play how you might initiate this discussion with your parents?

User: A role-play sounds a bit awkward, but I’m willing to try. I guess it might make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's a way to practice in a safe space. Let's start. Imagine you're sitting with your parents. How would you say hello and initiate the topic about school?

User: I might say, "Hey Mom, Dad, can we talk for a minute? I've been thinking about school and what I want to do." 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It’s clear and shows that you’re willing to share. What comes next after this opening?

User: I guess I’d share that I’ve been feeling like I want to go back to school, and maybe talk about the subjects I like, but I’m worried they might not be supportive.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. What evidence do you have that they might not be supportive? Have they reacted negatively in the past when you’ve mentioned school?

User: Well, they seem stressed about work and don’t really talk to me much about my education, so I assume they might not care.

Consultant: It's common to make assumptions based on limited information. What if we explore this more? Is it possible they’re just unsure how to engage or help you?

User: That makes sense. Maybe they just don’t know how to start the conversation either.

Consultant: Exactly! You could frame your conversation in a way that invites them in. For example, you could say, "I know we haven't talked much about school, but I really want to share my thoughts and hear yours too." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds better! It feels more collaborative. I might feel less pressure if I ask for their opinions too.

Consultant: Great insight, A! Asking for their input can help ease the conversation. Remember, their support could be incredibly valuable. What specific subjects are you thinking about discussing with them?

User: I’ve been interested in art and maybe some sciences. Those are more my style than what I was doing before.

Consultant: Wonderful! Expressing your interests shows that you have a clear vision for your future. How can you incorporate your interests into the conversation with your parents?

User: I guess I could say something like, "I've been thinking a lot about how much I enjoy art and science. I'd really like to explore those subjects more," and see how they respond.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! It’s assertive but still opens the door for dialogue. How does that feel to say out loud?

User: It feels empowering to even think about saying that. I can’t believe I’m actually considering it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s a significant change in your mindset. How do you think you can prepare for this conversation emotionally?

User: I should try to remind myself that it’s okay if they don’t react perfectly. I’ll just focus on sharing my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Focusing on expressing yourself is what matters. Can we discuss some practice techniques to manage anxiety beforehand?

User: Yes, what do you suggest?

Consultant: You could practice deep breathing exercises before the conversation to help calm your nerves. Also, visualizing the discussion going well can be beneficial. Have you ever tried that?

User: No, but I like the idea. I can picture myself talking confidently and them listening.

Consultant: Perfect! Visualization can enhance your confidence significantly. As we wrap up today, let’s recap the approach you’ll take with your parents.

User: I’ll start with a greeting, express my feelings about school, share my interests in art and science, invite their opinions, and practice deep breathing before.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, A! You’ve made great progress today. Remember, it’s about taking it step by step. How do you feel about your ability to implement this plan?

User: I feel more confident! I’ve got a clearer idea now, and I’m actually looking forward to the conversation.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. In our next session, we can discuss how it went, and not just the outcome but also how you felt during the process. 

User: Thank you, I’m looking forward to it too. I appreciate your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, A! You’re doing great work. Take care until next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm really glad to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. I've started setting small goals for myself, like joining a hobby class. It feels good to have something to work towards.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Setting small goals is a great step. How has that experience been for you so far? 

User: It's been nice. I feel like I have more control over my time. But sometimes, I still struggle to stay focused on my tasks.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you're easing back into a routine. What specific tasks do you find challenging to focus on?

User: Mainly studying or finishing assignments. I tend to get distracted easily, especially with my phone nearby.

Consultant: I understand. Distractions can really interrupt our flow. Have you tried any strategies to help minimize those distractions while working?

User: Not really. I often end up scrolling through social media instead of studying. 

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. Maybe we could explore some strategies together to help you stay focused? What do you think about setting specific times for studying, followed by breaks where you can check your phone?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I just worry about not sticking to it. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have concerns about keeping to a schedule. You can start small—perhaps set a timer for short study sessions, like 20 or 25 minutes, and then take a 5-minute break afterward. Does that sound manageable to you?

User: Yes, I think I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Tracking your time might help you gain a better understanding of how much you can accomplish within those periods. How do you feel about keeping a simple record of your study sessions?

User: I haven't thought of that, but it could help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It provides not only a way to see your progress but also a chance to celebrate your small victories. How does that feel in terms of your current motivations?

User: I feel it's encouraging to count small achievements. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Celebrating small successes can boost your confidence. Do you have any specific academic goals you’d like to work towards right now?

User: I think I want to get better at math. I’ve struggled with it for a long time.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Improving your math skills can certainly give you a sense of accomplishment. How about setting a goal to practice math for a certain amount of time each week? 

User: I could do that! Maybe I can start with just twice a week? 

Consultant: That sounds very realistic. Starting with two sessions a week allows you to gradually build up your confidence and skills. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good. It’s achievable, and I can always adjust it if it feels too much. 

Consultant: Exactly! Flexibility is key in managing your goals. What resources or materials do you think you’d need to support your math practice?

User: I might need some online tutorials or videos, but I haven’t explored much yet. 

Consultant: That’s a good start. There are many resources available online that can make learning math engaging. It might also help to set time aside to explore those options. Would you like to set a time for that in your week?

User: Yes, I can look for resources this weekend!

Consultant: Awesome! Meantime, how are you feeling about your progress and the plans we’ve discussed today? 

User: I feel optimistic. It seems like I have a clearer path ahead.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Feeling that way indicates personal growth. Remember, it’s okay to check in with yourself as you progress. Everyone moves at their own pace. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the reminder.

Consultant: Of course! One last thing—what strategies do you think you could use to monitor your feelings if you face challenges in sticking to your goals?

User: I guess if I feel overwhelmed, I could take a moment to breathe and reassess what I can achieve.

Consultant: That’s a very wise approach. Taking a moment to breathe and regroup is essential. It’s about finding balance and staying kind to yourself. 

User: Yes, I agree. I can do that!

Consultant: Wonderful! So for our next session, we can discuss how you implemented these strategies and any challenges you faced. Does that sound good? 

User: Yes, that works. I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Fantastic! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember to celebrate the small victories along the way. Have a great week ahead, and I’ll see you next time!

User: Thank you! See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you again! It sounds like you've made some great progress recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I really feel optimistic. I've been reflecting on my recent growth, and it's like I've finally started to understand myself better. I'm even thinking about going back to school.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Considering going back to school is a big step. Can you share what specifically has led you to feel this way about returning to your studies?

User: Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking about my future. I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and how I need to handle challenges. Plus, not being in school has made me realize I miss learning and interacting with others.

Consultant: It sounds like you've really engaged in some deep self-reflection. Missing the learning environment is important to acknowledge. What kind of challenges are you thinking you might face when you go back?

User: I worry that I might struggle with subjects like math again, and I don't want to repeat my past experiences. Also, I’m a bit anxious about fitting in again after being away for so long.

Consultant: Those concerns are completely valid. It’s understandable to feel anxious about returning to a familiar but challenging environment. What strategies do you think might help you deal with those worries about math and social interactions?

User: I think maybe having a study plan could help, and also talking to some teachers about getting extra help if I need it. As for social interactions, I don’t know, maybe joining clubs could help me meet people.

Consultant: Creating a study plan sounds like a great idea, as does reaching out for extra help. Joining clubs could be a fantastic way to connect with others. Can you identify specific subjects or topics you’d like to focus on first in your study plan?

User: Math is definitely at the top of my list, but I also want to improve my writing skills. It's always been something I enjoy, but I never got enough encouragement in the past.

Consultant: Focusing on math and writing is a good mix. It’s great to hear that you enjoy writing! How do you think you can incorporate more writing practice into your routine?

User: Maybe I could set aside a little time each day to write about my thoughts or even start a small blog. That could be a fun way to practice.

Consultant: Starting a blog sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! It could also help you gain confidence in your writing. What feelings do you anticipate as you start working on this plan?

User: I feel excited but also a little scared about putting myself out there. I don't want to be judged.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and fear. It shows that you care about your work and how it's received. What might help you manage those feelings of fear and judgment as you share your writing?

User: I think remembering that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own struggles would help. Maybe I could also find supportive friends who can give me feedback.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective! Reminding yourself that mistakes are part of the learning process can help ease those fears. Finding supportive friends who understand your journey can also make a big difference. Would you like to brainstorm ways to meet those supportive friends?

User: Yes, I think that would help. Maybe I could ask around in the clubs I want to join or even reach out to classmates on social media.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Engaging with classmates online can break the ice and build connections before school. How does this strategy make you feel about reintegrating with peers?

User: It makes me feel a bit more at ease. If I have some contacts before I start, it won't feel so overwhelming when I go back.

Consultant: Having connections before returning can definitely ease the transition. As we wrap up today, let's summarize the strategies you've discussed. What are the key steps you plan to take next?

User: I want to create a study plan focusing on math and writing, start a blog to practice my writing, and I’ll reach out to potential friends through clubs and social media.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps! You’ve set a positive course for yourself. How do you feel about everything we've talked about today?

User: I feel really positive! It’s nice to have a plan and know that I can approach it gradually.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress, and it's clear you’re ready to tackle these new challenges. Always remember to take it one step at a time. If you ever need support, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! Your support really means a lot to me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe you can achieve your goals. This is our last session for now, but I’m confident you can manage everything you've learned. Take care, and feel free to reach out if you need help in the future.
