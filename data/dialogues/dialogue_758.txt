Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today for our session. Before we dive in, I want to hear about how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite stressed and anxious, especially after my recent struggles during my internship. I see my classmates seemingly doing better, and it's making me feel really down about myself.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure, especially in comparison to your classmates. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about their successes?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough or that I will never reach the expectations my parents and teachers have for me. It's like I’m constantly disappointing everyone, including myself.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling like you're falling short of expectations. It seems like these thoughts are really overwhelming. When you say you're not good enough, what emotions do you feel along with that?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes really sad. It's like there's this weight on my chest, and I can't breathe properly. I also experience headaches and find it hard to sleep at night.

Consultant: Those physical symptoms must be very distressing for you. It seems like the anxiety and sadness are affecting not only your emotions but your overall well-being too. We can definitely work on understanding these feelings better. What do you think would help ease your mind and reduce these symptoms?

User: I wish I could just be more confident and less affected by what others think. I want to focus on myself and my journey instead of comparing myself to my friends.

Consultant: That's a very insightful goal. Building self-confidence and shifting your focus back to your own journey is so important. Have there been any moments during your internship when you felt proud of yourself or accomplished something?

User: There were a few times when I handled a challenging situation well with a patient, and I felt proud. But those moments are quickly overshadowed by the times I mess up or feel inadequate.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you had those accomplishments! It sounds like you might be focusing more on the negative experiences rather than celebrating the positive ones. Can you think of any specific thoughts that come up when you remember those proud moments?

User: I often think, “That was just luck” or “I’ll probably mess up next time.” I keep doubting my abilities.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite critical and can be very discouraging. What if we challenged those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that your success was just due to luck or that you will mess up again?

User: Well, I suppose I don’t have solid evidence for that. I guess I just assume the worst because I'm afraid of failing again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear failure, especially when it feels like there’s a lot at stake. Let’s try to reframe that thought. If you were to look at it differently, how might you view your skills and efforts in those successful moments?

User: Maybe I could acknowledge that I did prepare and try my best, which contributed to those good outcomes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your effort and preparation is crucial. You’re not just relying on luck; you’re applying your skills. That’s a sign of your capabilities. How does it feel to think of it that way?

User: It feels a bit relieving. It's like I have something to hold on to again.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Holding on to those moments can really help build your confidence. Now, let's think about how to maintain this perspective in challenging times. What strategies do you think might help you stay grounded in your positive achievements?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my successes, no matter how small. That might help me remember the good times when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic idea! It could serve as a great reminder of your capabilities and the progress you've made. Would you be willing to try this and see how it impacts your feelings over time?

User: Yes, I’m willing to try that! It sounds like it could really help.

Consultant: Great! I’m glad to hear you’re open to that. Let's also explore how to handle those negative thoughts when they arise. How about developing a simple coping statement that you can remind yourself of during tough moments?

User: That sounds helpful, but I’m not sure what to say to myself.

Consultant: Let's try something together. How about a statement like, “I am capable, and I learn from my experiences”? Does that resonate with you, or would you prefer to adjust it?

User: I like that! It feels positive and encouraging.

Consultant: Wonderful! Keeping that statement handy can really make a difference. When you find yourself slipping into negative thoughts, you can remind yourself of your capability and growth. How do you feel about implementing this into your daily routine?

User: I think I can do that! It gives me something to focus on positively instead of dwelling on the negative.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s so important to shift your focus. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress we've made. What have you found most beneficial from our conversation today?

User: I think recognizing my achievements and working on my self-talk has been really valuable. It feels like a step towards feeling better about myself.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Acknowledging your strengths is a significant step toward building your confidence. Remember, it's a process, and you’re already on your way. As we conclude today, what strategies can you commitment to work on before our next session?

User: I will start journaling my achievements and practice my coping statement daily.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Take your time with this, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and every small step matters. Take care, Li!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I'm feeling a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear you’re feeling hopeful. Until next time, take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel even more overwhelmed. My internship has been really stressful, and I'm starting to think I can't handle it. It's hard for me to believe that I can succeed.

Consultant: I hear you. The stress from your internship seems to be taking a toll on your confidence and outlook for the future. Can you share more about what specifically feels overwhelming for you?

User: I feel like I'm not meeting the expectations of my supervisors or my own expectations. Sometimes, I think maybe I should just quit. I doubt myself a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure coming from both external sources, like your supervisors, and internal expectations you’ve set for yourself. Let’s explore these feelings a bit more. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I’m failing and that I’m not cut out for this job. It makes me feel sad and inadequate.

Consultant: Those thoughts of failing and feeling inadequate can be very heavy to carry. Do you think those thoughts accurately reflect the situation, or could they be influenced by fear of not meeting expectations?

User: I guess they might be more about my fears. I tend to think the worst. It’s hard for me to see things differently.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Our minds often jump to conclusions, especially under stress. Let’s take a step back. What evidence supports the thought that you are failing? 

User: Well, I made a mistake on one of my tasks the other day, and it felt like a big deal. I just focused on that one moment.

Consultant: It seems that one mistake has overshadowed everything else. Mistakes are part of the learning process, especially in a challenging new environment like your internship. Can you think of any positive feedback or moments where you felt competent in your role?

User: I did get a compliment from a nurse for my patient care. But it wasn’t enough to counterbalance my feelings of failure.

Consultant: That feedback is important! It shows that you have strengths worth recognizing. Let’s challenge that thought a bit more. If a friend were in your situation, what would you say to them about their mistake?

User: I would tell them it happens to everyone and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s helpful to see your situation from an external perspective. You’re learning and growing in your role, just like anyone else would. What if you allowed yourself to embrace those moments of success alongside the mistakes?

User: That makes sense. I really want to do better and not feel this way anymore.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that desire for change, Li. Let’s focus on some strategies that can help build your confidence. What are some small, manageable actions you could take in your internship that might help you feel more accomplished?

User: I could try to ask my supervisor for feedback on my performance more often. That might help me understand what I’m doing well.

Consultant: Asking for feedback is a wonderful idea! It can provide clarity and reinforce your strengths. How do you feel about setting a goal to seek feedback, perhaps once a week?

User: I feel okay about that. It would help me keep track of my progress. 

Consultant: Excellent! This could lead to a more balanced perspective on your performance. As we move forward, let’s also discuss managing those feelings of self-doubt. When you notice those negative thoughts creeping in, can you try reminding yourself of your successes, no matter how small?

User: I could do that. I’d probably need to write them down to remember them better.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! Keeping a success journal can help reinforce those positive experiences and counterbalance the negativity. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection.

User: I’ll definitely start that. But what if I still feel anxious despite all of this?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious during challenging times. It’s about learning to accept those feelings without letting them dominate. When anxiety arises, try grounding techniques—like calming your breath or focusing on your surroundings.

User: I’ll definitely try those grounding techniques. They sound helpful.

Consultant: Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. We’ve identified the negative thoughts you have about your performance, acknowledged the pressure you feel, and explored ways to reframe those thoughts through feedback and self-reflection. 

User: Yes, that summarizes everything well. I feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li. It’s all about taking small steps. As we conclude our session, remember that you have the tools and strategies within you to manage these feelings. How do you feel about our work today?

User: I feel like I have a plan now. I’ll work on keeping track of my successes and asking for feedback. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe you can make progress. If these feelings arise again, we can work through them together in our next session. Take care, Li, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m glad to see you today for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling more anxious lately. I keep thinking about the mistakes I made during my internship. I can't shake off this feeling of guilt.

Consultant: I hear you, Li. It sounds like those thoughts and feelings of guilt are having a significant impact on you. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about those mistakes?

User: I keep replaying the mistakes over and over. I feel like I’m not cut out for this job and that everyone is judging me. It’s really hard to concentrate on my tasks.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you care so much about your work. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think, “I’m not cut out for this job,” what emotions do you experience?

User: I feel really low, like I’ve let everyone down. I worry that I’ll never be able to do the job well.

Consultant: Those feelings of disappointment can be quite heavy to carry. Have you considered what evidence you have that supports or contradicts that thought of not being capable?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. I mean, I did well in school and I have received positive feedback before, but this mistake keeps overshadowing everything.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve had positive experiences and feedback in the past. Let’s think about that for a moment. If a friend made a similar mistake, what would you tell her?

User: I’d probably tell her that everyone makes mistakes and to learn from them. I would encourage her not to be too hard on herself.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response! What if you tried to apply that same kindness to yourself? How would that change your perspective?

User: I suppose it could help. I need to remind myself that mistakes are a part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to recognize that making mistakes doesn’t define your ability. It’s an opportunity to learn and grow. How about we explore some ways to challenge those negative thoughts you have about yourself during stressful times?

User: That sounds good. I want to be able to shift my mindset, but I often get stuck in negative thinking.

Consultant: One technique we can use is positive self-talk. When you notice negative thoughts occurring, you could replace them with positive affirmations. For instance, saying to yourself, "I am capable and still learning." What do you think about trying this approach?

User: I think it could be helpful. I just find it hard to believe those affirmations sometimes.

Consultant: That’s completely normal, Li. It takes practice. Maybe we can start small. Can you think of a specific situation where positive self-talk could help during your internship?

User: Maybe before I interact with my colleagues. I often feel intimidated and worried they think I don’t know what I’m doing.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Before those interactions, try repeating a positive affirmation like, “I am learning and growing every day.” Practicing this could help build your confidence. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can try that. I hope it helps me feel less nervous.

Consultant: It’s a step in the right direction! Besides using positive affirmations, what else do you think you could do to improve your interactions with your colleagues?

User: Maybe I could reach out to them more, instead of isolating myself. I often avoid chatting because I’m afraid of saying something wrong.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Gradually reaching out and initiating small conversations can help reduce your anxiety. What kind of small talk could you start with?

User: I could ask them about their day or if they have any tips for handling certain tasks. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It’s a good way to connect with them. With each conversation, you'll likely build more confidence. How would you feel about trying to initiate a conversation this week?

User: I’m feeling a bit nervous about it, but I think I can give it a shot. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Li! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Just take it one step at a time. What’s one thing you’ll do before your next session to prepare for this conversation?

User: I’ll practice the affirmations we discussed and maybe jot down some questions to ask.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Those preparations can help ease your anxiety. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about. What do you take away from our session today?

User: I feel like I have strategies to combat my negative thoughts and ways to engage with my colleagues. I’m hopeful that practicing self-talk and reaching out will help boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve identified some positive steps moving forward, and it seems like you have a clearer path ahead. Don’t forget to celebrate your efforts, no matter how small. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li. It’s been a pleasure to support you through this process. Remember, it’s a journey and you’re doing great. I’ll be looking forward to hearing how your week goes in our next session. 

User: I will! See you next time. 

Consultant: Take care, Li, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Li! Welcome back to our session. I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still sense a lot of distance with my colleagues. It’s like they’re not interested in engaging with me, and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're still struggling with feelings of isolation at work. Can you share more about specific interactions you’ve had recently with your colleagues that made you feel this way?

User: Well, just yesterday, I tried to join a discussion during lunch, but they seemed to shut me down quickly. It made me feel really uncomfortable, and I ended up sitting quietly.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it’s understandable that you would feel uncomfortable in that situation. How did that experience impact your thoughts about yourself and your ability to connect with them?

User: It made me doubt myself. I thought maybe they don’t like me or that I’m not good enough to be part of their conversations.

Consultant: It’s common for negative experiences to affect our self-esteem. When you thought that they might not like you, what emotions did that bring up for you?

User: I felt really sad and a bit angry. I don’t understand why it has to be this way.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel sad and frustrated in that situation. Let’s explore those thoughts of “not being good enough.” How often do you find yourself thinking that way, especially in social situations?

User: Quite often, especially at work. I feel like I shouldn’t speak up if I don’t have something great to say.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. What evidence do you have that supports this thought that you shouldn’t speak up unless you have something great to say?

User: I guess there's no solid evidence. It’s more of a fear I have of being judged.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this fear of judgment is influencing how you interact with your colleagues. Can we think of a time when you spoke up and felt good about it?

User: Actually, there was an instance where I shared some ideas during a meeting, and my manager acknowledged them. That felt nice.

Consultant: That's a wonderful example! How can we build on that positive experience? What if we challenge that thought of needing to have something “great” to say? 

User: I suppose I could try just sharing my thoughts or questions, even if they aren’t perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your thoughts, even if they’re just questions, can help you engage more with your colleagues. How do you feel about setting a small goal to do this at your next interaction?

User: I think I can try that. Maybe I could ask a simple question during our team meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Li! Asking questions can be a great way to open the door to conversation. How will you prepare yourself to do that?

User: I might write down a couple of questions beforehand to feel less anxious.

Consultant: Great strategy! Having questions prepared can help you feel more confident. As you think about this, how do you feel about your ability to make connections with your colleagues now compared to before?

User: I feel slightly more hopeful. It’s still scary, but I see there is a way to approach it.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your thinking! It's important to acknowledge this progress. How can we ensure that you maintain this sense of hope and confidence moving forward?

User: I suppose I could reflect on my successes or the steps I took after each interaction.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce that sense of achievement. What other strategies do you think could help you feel more comfortable in future social situations at work?

User: Maybe practicing role-play scenarios with some friends where we can pretend to have conversations. That could help me feel ready.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Role-playing can help ease anxiety by providing practice in a safe environment. What steps can you take to set that up?

User: I can reach out to a couple of friends this week and ask if they’d be willing to help me with that.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s proactive and a step toward what you want. Let’s wrap up today by summarizing what you feel are the key takeaways from our session. 

User: I feel I need to challenge my negative thoughts and try asking questions to connect with my colleagues. Also, reflecting on my successes will help boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s excellent, Li. You’ve identified some great strategies today. Remember, you’re already making progress. I’m looking forward to hearing how your next interactions go. When would you like to meet again?

User: Let's meet again next week. I’d love to share what happens after I try this out!

Consultant: Sounds great! I’m here for you anytime. Take care and best of luck with your goals.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident about my abilities at work. I think my relationships with my colleagues have improved, which is nice.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It's wonderful that you're noticing these positive changes. What specific situations or interactions at work have contributed to this newfound confidence?

User: Well, I recently handled a difficult patient situation more effectively than I expected. My colleagues complimented my approach, which made me feel proud.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement! It sounds like you received positive feedback that really boosted your self-esteem. How did it feel for you to get that validation from your colleagues?

User: It felt amazing, but I still sometimes doubt if I can keep this up. I don’t want to disappoint them or myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you're striving for success. Let’s explore that doubt a bit more. What specific thoughts come to mind when you start feeling that way?

User: I often think that maybe it was just luck, or that I won't be able to perform well consistently.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're concerned about maintaining your performance. Can you recall any specific evidence that proves you can handle such situations consistently?

User: I mean, I did well in my training and I've received good feedback from patients before, but I still can't shake off the feeling that I might not be as good as others think.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing your past successes. What if you replaced that thought of "maybe it's just luck" with one that acknowledges your hard work and skills? How would that change your perspective?

User: I suppose I could think that my training and experience contributed to my success, not just luck. It could help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Exactly! By validating your own skills, you empower yourself to embrace challenges. Can we try an exercise together? Let's think of situations where you've succeeded, and identify the specific skills you used.

User: Sure! I think communication was key when dealing with the patient. I was able to listen and respond thoughtfully.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight, Li! Communication is a vital skill, especially in your field. Recognizing and celebrating this ability can reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about making a list of your strengths and past successes?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I usually focus on my shortcomings, so having a list of positives could help me a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your strengths can shift your mindset positively. We could also incorporate regular self-affirmations based on your strengths. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. It might help me remember my capabilities rather than just my fears.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s create a plan for you to practice those affirmations daily. How about setting a specific time each day, perhaps in the morning before work?

User: Yes, I can do that. It would be a nice way to start my day.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s important to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this process. On days when self-doubt creeps in, how can you remind yourself of your achievements?

User: I can read my list of strengths or recite the affirmations I've made. That should help me refocus.

Consultant: Absolutely! That could serve as a powerful reminder of what you’ve accomplished. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. How do you feel about your journey so far?

User: I feel much more optimistic about my work and my abilities. I think I have a clearer way to keep building my confidence.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! You’ve achieved a lot, and I believe you have the tools to maintain and further your progress. Remember to keep nurturing that self-belief. If challenges arise, you know where to find support.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I'll work on my lists and affirmations.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep up the great work, and take care of yourself!

User: Will do! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more stable in your emotions and work performance. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. My social skills have improved, and I feel more confident at work. But I want to make sure I continue this positive trajectory.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Li! It sounds like you're really making progress. Let's discuss how you're managing this stability in both your personal and professional life. What specific improvements have you noticed lately?

User: Well, I've become more comfortable interacting with my colleagues. I used to feel shy in group settings, but now I can speak up more easily. It's nice to feel included.

Consultant: It must feel rewarding to connect more with your colleagues. Can you think of any specific situations where you felt particularly proud of your progress in social interactions?

User: Yes, just last week, I contributed to a team discussion about patient care, and my ideas were well-received. I used to worry about speaking up, but it went really well!

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! It’s great that your contributions were valued. How did that experience affect your confidence moving forward in similar situations?

User: It boosted my confidence a lot. I realized that my input matters, and it encouraged me to share my thoughts more often. I'm still a bit nervous, but I'm pushing myself.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're pushing yourself to grow, even with the nerves. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up for you when you feel anxious about speaking up?

User: Sometimes I worry that my ideas aren't good enough, or that I'll embarrass myself. But I try to remind myself that everyone is learning and growing.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Li. Recognizing those thoughts is the first step in challenging them. What alternative thoughts could you replace those worries with?

User: I could think that my ideas might help someone, or that it's okay to make mistakes because that's part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing those thoughts can be powerful. It seems like you have a good grasp on how to approach your anxiety. How do you plan to continue reinforcing this positive mindset?

User: I think I’ll keep pushing myself to speak up in meetings and perhaps even practice what I want to say beforehand to feel more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy, Li. Preparation can definitely help increase your confidence. How else can you support yourself in maintaining this positive momentum in your work environment?

User: Maybe I could set personal goals for myself, like initiating conversations with colleagues or sharing more ideas in discussions.

Consultant: Setting personal goals is a fantastic way to keep challenging yourself and growing. How do you feel about tracking those goals to see your progress over time?

User: I like that idea! I could write them down and check them off as I achieve them. Seeing my progress might motivate me even more.

Consultant: That's a great approach! By tracking your goals, you’ll have a visual reminder of your achievements. How do you feel about discussing what barriers you might face while pursuing these goals?

User: I sometimes worry about rejection or criticism when I share my thoughts. That fear still lingers a bit.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those fears, but remember that not every critique is a reflection of your worth or abilities. How could you manage those fears when they come up?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has different opinions, and that not everyone has to agree with me. I need to focus on my own growth instead.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Focusing on your growth and learning can help you remain resilient. What steps can you take if you do encounter criticism?

User: I could take a moment to reflect on the feedback rather than react immediately. It might help me process it better and not take it personally.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Li. Taking a moment to reflect can help you respond thoughtfully. As we move forward, what ongoing support do you think you need to maintain your progress?

User: I think regular check-ins would be helpful to stay accountable. Having someone to talk to about my experiences would keep me motivated.

Consultant: I’m glad you mentioned that! Regular check-ins can indeed provide support and help reinforce your growth. We can schedule our sessions to ensure you’re feeling supported as you continue to develop.

User: That sounds perfect. I appreciate having this space to talk and explore my feelings.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that, Li! Your openness is key to making progress. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to continue your self-improvement journey.

User: I’ve learned that I need to challenge my negative thoughts, set personal goals, and track my progress. It’s all about pushing myself outside my comfort zone.

Consultant: Great summary, Li! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you have the tools to continue on this path. Keep nurturing your confidence, and remember that it’s perfectly okay to seek help whenever needed.

User: Thank you for your support! I feel more equipped to face challenges ahead.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you’ve come a long way, and I'm proud of your progress. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need assistance in the future. Until next time, take care!

User: I will! Thank you again. Goodbye!
