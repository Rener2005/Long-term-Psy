Consultant: Hello, Xiaoshang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious, especially with the exams coming up. I can't focus on studying, and I feel overwhelmed by the whole situation.

Consultant: I can hear how stressed you are. It sounds like the upcoming exams are weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts are running through your mind when you think about the exams?

User: I keep worrying about failing the exams and potentially having to retake the courses. I feel like I’m letting everyone down, especially my mom.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel that pressure, especially given your history with your mom regarding your studies. How does this worry about failing make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel anxious and somewhat hopeless. Sometimes, I doubt my abilities and wonder if I’m cut out for this major.

Consultant: Doubting yourself can feel really heavy. When those thoughts come up, what else do you notice about your feelings or even your physical state?

User: My heart races, and I have trouble sleeping. Sometimes, I just want to escape everything, but I know I can't.

Consultant: It sounds like your anxiety is affecting both your mind and body, which is quite common. Let's work on breaking this cycle. Can you recall a recent moment when you felt these anxious thoughts strongly?

User: Yes, just the other night, I sat down to study but ended up staring at the books for hours without getting anything done. I felt so frustrated.

Consultant: That frustration can be paralyzing. What were the thoughts you had while you were staring at your books?

User: I kept thinking, "What if I fail? What if I disappoint my mom again?" It just spirals from there.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to lead you to a very negative place. Let’s take a closer look at those beliefs. Do you think there is any evidence that supports the idea that you will definitely fail? 

User: Well, I have struggled in the past, but I also did well in some classes. I guess it's not all bad, but the fear just seems louder.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! It's important to remember that past struggles don't define your future. If you were to reframe that fear – what would be a more balanced thought?

User: Maybe I could think, "I have prepared well before, and I can do it again"? 

Consultant: That sounds much more constructive! Let's focus on practicing that thought when you start feeling anxious. What other strategies do you think could help you manage your anxiety and stay focused?

User: I think I could try setting small study goals and maybe take breaks to relax.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Setting small goals can make things feel more manageable. What kind of breaks do you think would be helpful for you?

User: I could take short walks or listen to music for a bit. 

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ways to refresh your mind. Also, as you prepare for your exams, it might help to reach out to classmates or teachers if you're feeling stuck. How does that sound to you?

User: I guess I could ask for help, but I usually hesitate to reach out.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel hesitant, but remember, you are not alone in this. Many students feel the same way, and asking for help could actually strengthen your understanding. Can you identify a small step you could take to reach out this week?

User: Maybe I could start with a group study session with some classmates.

Consultant: That's a fantastic first step! It would not only help you academically but also socially. How do you feel about the idea of joining a study group?

User: I think it could relieve some pressure and maybe help me feel less isolated.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Feeling less isolated can certainly ease anxiety. As we continue our work together, it’s important to remember that anxiety can be managed, and you’re already on the right track. 

User: I hope so. I really want to believe I can get through this.

Consultant: You can, Xiaoshang. Let's recap what we've discussed today. You’ve identified some positive thoughts to replace your negative ones, considered strategies for managing your break times, and you’re planning to reach out to classmates. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have some tools now.

Consultant: That’s right! And keep practicing those positive thoughts and different coping strategies. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you can carry with you until our next session?

User: I think I’ll focus on taking things one step at a time and not let the fear of failure consume me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Xiaoshang. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I believe in your ability to manage this situation, and I'm here for you. Until our next session, take care! 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit lighter now. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, welcome back to our session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been doing a little better in terms of anxiety, but I still feel a lot of pressure related to my studies. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're struggling to fully believe in your academic abilities, even though your anxiety has lessened a bit. Can you tell me more about what's been causing you to feel this way regarding your studies?

User: Well, I keep comparing myself to my classmates, and it feels like everyone is doing better than me. Even though I try to study, I often get distracted, and then I think I'm just not capable of improving.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re comparing your progress to others. Let’s take a closer look at these thoughts. When you think “I’m not capable of improving,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel frustrated and sad. I feel like I’m letting everyone down, especially my mom. Our conversations usually revolve around my grades, and I just want her to be proud of me.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to carry that weight of expectation from your mom. You're feeling frustrated and sad because you want to meet those expectations. Have you noticed any specific situations or events that trigger these negative thoughts about your abilities?

User: Yes, usually it's when I'm studying and I hit a difficult topic. I sometimes just freeze, and then I start thinking that I should automatically understand everything, which I know isn't realistic. 

Consultant: That's a common feeling—expecting ourselves to grasp everything quickly. Can you remember an instance where you encountered a tough topic and how you reacted to it?

User: There was a math problem last week that I just couldn't solve. Instead of reaching out for help, I shut down and avoided it altogether. I felt overwhelmed and convinced that I would fail if I couldn't figure it out myself.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It seems like that moment contributed to your feelings of inadequacy. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to seek help when facing something challenging, instead of trying to solve everything on your own?

User: I guess it would make things less stressful. But I worry that my classmates will think I'm not smart enough if I ask questions.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember that everyone struggles with different subjects at times. If a friend came to you sharing the same fear, how would you respond to them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to ask for help and that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d be supportive to them, just like how you should allow that same kindness towards yourself. What if you tried to challenge your thought of “If I ask for help, it shows I’m not smart”? What alternative thought could you embrace?

User: Maybe I could think that asking for help shows I’m proactive and want to learn.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective! Seeing yourself as proactive rather than inadequate is empowering. How do you feel when you think about asking for help with that new mindset?

User: It feels a little less daunting. I think I could actually do it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue, let’s focus on practical steps. What small actions could we take this week to get you started on asking for help and working with your classmates?

User: I could try forming a study group with a few classmates. I think it would really help to discuss things together.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Collaborating with others can not only clarify doubts but also build your confidence. How about setting a specific day to reach out and invite them to study together?

User: Maybe I can message them tomorrow and set something up for the weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Before we wrap up, how do you feel about all the progress we've discussed today?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to think that asking for help can improve my situation instead of making it worse.

Consultant: Absolutely, and I believe you can achieve that. Remember to acknowledge the small victories along the way. Next time, we can discuss how the study group goes and explore any challenges you encounter. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll definitely keep you updated.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Just remember, you’re taking important steps towards building your confidence. If you need anything before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoshang! I'm happy to see you today. I remember from our last session that you were feeling quite overwhelmed with your studies. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! Honestly, not much has changed. I still feel anxious about my studies, especially with assignments piling up. I really want to improve, but I just don't know how to manage my time better.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious, especially with the pressure of deadlines. Let's explore your current study routine. Could you describe what a typical study day looks like for you?

User: Usually, I try to study a few hours in the library, but I get easily distracted and end up just scrolling on my phone. I want to focus, but I feel overwhelmed by everything I need to do.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of wanting to study but struggling with distraction. Can you identify what kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think things like, "I'll never catch up," or "What if I fail?" Those thoughts just make me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very powerful and stressful. Let's try to challenge them together. What evidence do you have that suggests you'll fail or won't catch up?

User: Well, I guess I haven't failed any classes yet. But sometimes, it just feels like I'm falling behind compared to my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a great point. It sounds like you’ve been doing well in your classes so far, even if it feels difficult now. How do you think a friend would view your situation if they were in your shoes?

User: I think a friend would probably tell me that I'm doing okay and not to be too hard on myself. They'd say that everyone has ups and downs.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to be kind to yourself. Now, let's consider creating a concrete study plan together. What would you think about setting specific goals for each study session?

User: That might help! But what if I still can’t focus?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. We can incorporate short breaks into your study sessions to help maintain focus. How does 25 minutes of studying followed by a 5-minute break sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! Maybe I could use those breaks to stretch or grab a snack.

Consultant: Great idea! That will give your mind a chance to rest. How about trying this plan for a week, and then we can discuss how it went in our next session?

User: Sure, I can give it a try! I'm hoping it helps me feel more in control.

Consultant: It's encouraging to see you feeling optimistic about it. Beyond studying, how have your friendships and social life been lately?

User: Honestly, I’ve been avoiding social situations. The thought of being around a lot of people makes me anxious.

Consultant: That’s quite common, especially when we're stressed. Would you be open to discussing ways to gradually engage in social settings without feeling overwhelmed?

User: I think I'd like that. Maybe I could start by hanging out with one or two friends instead of going to big gatherings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Taking smaller steps will help build your confidence. Can you think of someone you'd feel comfortable reaching out to?

User: Yes, I have a couple of friends I trust. I could invite them over for a study session.

Consultant: Perfect! Combining studying with socializing might help ease some of that anxiety. What do you think you can say to them to make the invitation?

User: I could just say I need some study buddies and would love their help. That sounds easy enough!

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to share how you’re feeling with them, too. Letting them know you'll appreciate their support can strengthen your bond. 

User: Yes, I will let them know. I'm feeling a bit better about this now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Let’s recap what you’ll do this week: try the study plan and invite your friends for support. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I'm ready to give that a shot.

Consultant: Wonderful! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoshang. Take care, and I’m excited for our next conversation!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Shang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, I think. I'm trying to balance my studies with social activities. Recently, I've joined some clubs and attended a few lectures, which has helped me feel a bit more confident socially. But I still get nervous in crowded places.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're taking steps to expand your social circle! It's understandable to feel anxious in crowded situations. Can you tell me more about the feelings you experience when you're in those environments?

User: Sure. When I'm in a crowded room, I often feel overwhelmed and want to just leave. I start to think that everyone is looking at me, judging me, and then I feel really self-conscious. 

Consultant: It sounds like those crowds bring up some uncomfortable thoughts and emotions for you. What do you think those thoughts are telling you about the situation?

User: They tell me that I won't fit in or that people won't want to talk to me. I feel like it's better to avoid those situations altogether because it’s less stressful.

Consultant: I can understand why you’d feel that way; avoiding uncomfortable situations can seem easier. However, avoiding can sometimes prevent us from making progress. What if we explored some smaller social settings together? 

User: That might be helpful. I guess starting small could be easier than jumping into big crowds.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small can help you gradually build confidence. Can you think of a situation that feels manageable for you where you could interact with a few people, rather than a large crowd?

User: Maybe attending a smaller club meeting? I know there are some gatherings with just a few members. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Attending a smaller club meeting could be a great step forward. How do you feel about setting a goal to attend one of those meetings this week?

User: I think I could try that. I'm a bit nervous, but I also feel somewhat excited about it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, but it's wonderful to see your excitement! Let’s also integrate some relaxation techniques. Do you have any methods you currently use to calm yourself down when you start to feel anxious?

User: Not really. I usually just try to avoid thinking about it or distract myself. 

Consultant: Distracting yourself can be helpful to an extent, but what do you think about exploring some relaxation exercises, like deep breathing or visualization? 

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I’ve never really tried it. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! It can help you calm your mind in those moments of anxiety. Would you like me to guide you through a simple deep breathing exercise right now?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let's do this together. First, find a comfortable position. Now, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a moment... and now slowly breathe out through your mouth for a count of six. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels nice. I feel a little calmer already!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Practicing this technique before situations that make you anxious can really help. How about we also discuss what you might say to yourself when you arrive at that club meeting to support yourself?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that I'm there to learn and meet new people.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a wonderful affirmation. Reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel nervous while focusing on your goals can really shift your mindset. How do you feel about implementing that?

User: I feel good about it. I think it will help me approach the situation with a better mindset.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's all about taking small, manageable steps and giving yourself grace as you work through this. After attending the meeting, let's plan to reflect on how it went together. 

User: That sounds like a plan! I appreciate having someone to talk to about this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Shang. You’re doing great work by being here and tackling these feelings. Just keep reminding yourself of your progress. Are there any other concerns or thoughts you have today?

User: Not right now. I think I've got a good plan to move forward.

Consultant: That's excellent! I'm really proud of you for being proactive. Remember, it’s always okay to reach out if you need support. I look forward to hearing about how your meeting goes.

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more optimistic now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome. Remember, building confidence takes time, but you're on the right path. Enjoy the club meeting, and I'll see you next time to discuss your experience! 

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling regarding your studies and exam preparations?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. With finals coming up, I'm starting to doubt whether my study methods are effective. I really want to do well, but I'm feeling anxious about it all.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with finals approaching. Could you share a bit about what specifically makes you feel anxious about your study methods and your upcoming exams?

User: Well, I often question if I'm studying the right way. Sometimes I feel like I'm not retaining what I've learned, and it just adds to my stress. I want to improve, but I'm unsure how.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform well and are worried about your study efficiency. What would you like to achieve in terms of your study preparation? How would it feel to have a clearer plan?

User: I wish I could feel confident about my methods and know that I'm on the right track. It would be great to have a sense of progress and maybe even see some results from my efforts.

Consultant: The idea of having a clear plan and seeing progress is really important. Let’s explore your current study methods together. Can you describe what your study routine looks like right now?

User: I usually just read through my notes and textbooks, sometimes I watch videos related to the material. But I’m not sure if that’s effective enough.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that! It sounds like you're trying to cover the material in various ways, which is a good start. While reading and watching videos can help, let's think about how you can make your study time more effective. Have you ever used any memorization techniques or structured your study sessions with time management?

User: I've heard about some memorization techniques but never really applied them. I often just find myself cramming the night before an exam.

Consultant: Cramming can indeed add to your stress. Using techniques like spaced repetition or memory aids can improve retention. Would you like to explore those together and see how they can fit into your study routine?

User: Yes, I’d really like that! I want to know how to use those techniques.

Consultant: Great! Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at increasing intervals, which helps reinforce memory. You can also try creating flashcards to test yourself. Does that sound manageable to you?

User: It does! I've never made flashcards before, but I think I could give it a shot.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Additionally, let's talk about structuring your study time. Instead of marathon sessions, consider shorter bursts of focused study time followed by brief breaks. Have you tried this before?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I usually just sit for hours hoping to get through everything.

Consultant: Changing your approach might help reduce that anxious feeling. You could try a technique like the Pomodoro Technique: study intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. How does that sound to you?

User: I like the idea of short study intervals! It might help me stay focused without feeling drained.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Let’s set some specific goals for your study sessions this week. What subjects do you plan to focus on first, and how can we break them into manageable pieces?

User: For the next week, I want to focus on my statistics and marketing courses. I think I could break them into chapters for each study session.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Focusing on one chapter at a time using the techniques we discussed could boost your confidence. How will you measure your progress throughout the week?

User: I think I could keep a checklist for each chapter I complete and maybe jot down what concepts I’m struggling with as I go.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Tracking your progress will give you a sense of accomplishment, which is crucial. As we move further, how do you feel about accountability in your study process?

User: Having someone to check in with could really help me stay on track. I’ve struggled with motivation alone, so that sounds beneficial.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having an accountability partner can motivate you to stick to your study plan. Perhaps you can share your goals with a classmate or friend. What do you think?

User: That’s a great idea! I have a friend in my statistics class who might be willing to help.

Consultant: Perfect! Support systems can make a big difference. Now, let’s circle back to how you're feeling. After thinking about these strategies, does your anxiety about studying seem more manageable?

User: Yes, I feel a little bit lighter. Having a plan makes it feel less overwhelming. I’m excited to try out these new approaches!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to feel some pressure, but you have the tools now to tackle it. How about we check in next time about how these strategies are working for you?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to sharing my progress and learning more.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll review what worked and develop more strategies for the future. Before we wrap up, what would you consider your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think it’s the importance of having a structured study plan and using techniques like flashcards. I believe this will help me a lot during finals.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Having a strategy can boost your confidence significantly. As we move forward, remember to celebrate even small victories. How do you plan to maintain this positivity as you study?

User: I’ll remind myself of my progress and maybe treat myself with something I enjoy after completing my study goals.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Rewards can really help reinforce positive behavior. I'm excited for you to implement these strategies and see how they work. If you face any challenges along the way, feel free to reach out. You’re making great strides!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more hopeful about my exams now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here to support you. Remember, you’ve got this! Looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoshang! It's great to see you back for another session. I'm glad to hear that you've made progress with your studies. Can you share how you're feeling about your recent achievements?

User: Hi! I'm really happy about it. I felt like the new strategies I tried out for revising and preparing for exams worked well, and my grades improved. It feels nice to see the results of my hard work.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's always rewarding when effort translates into success. What specific strategies do you think contributed most to your improvement?

User: I started breaking down my study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks and set short-term goals for each session. It made studying less overwhelming and I could focus better.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach! Setting short-term goals and breaking tasks into smaller parts can really help manage anxiety and make studying feel more achievable. How did you feel emotionally while using these strategies?

User: I felt more in control and less stressed. Before, I would get really anxious just thinking about studying, but now it feels more structured. I even found some time to relax and enjoy activities I like.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you found balance and enjoyment! Feeling more in control can significantly enhance your emotional well-being. What activities did you enjoy during your relaxation time?

User: I spent some time gaming and hanging out with friends. It really helped me unwind after long study sessions. I hadn't done that much before.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy way to balance out your study efforts! Taking breaks and enjoying activities with friends is important for maintaining overall well-being. Do you think you can continue to incorporate these activities into your routine moving forward?

User: Yes, I think I want to make it a regular thing. It's important to have that downtime, especially after intense study periods.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maintaining a balance between work and leisure is key to avoiding burnout. As we wrap up our discussion today, what do you think are the most important strategies you can employ to keep progressing in your studies while managing your emotions?

User: I believe I should stick to my short-term goals and not hesitate to ask for help when needed. Also, making sure I take breaks to recharge is essential.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Setting goals, seeking support, and prioritizing breaks are all important for sustainable growth. Looking ahead, how do you feel about the challenges that may arise in your future studies?

User: I feel more optimistic now. I’m confident that I can handle them better than before. Plus, I have strategies to fall back on.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have, Xiaoshang! It’s clear you’ve gained valuable skills during our time together. As a final note, what specific actions or reminders could you implement to help sustain your progress?

User: I could create a visual reminder of my goals and achievements to keep myself motivated. Maybe I can also set regular check-ins with myself to reflect on how I'm doing.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Keeping visual reminders can be very powerful in maintaining focus and motivation. Regular self-reflection check-ins will also support your emotional awareness. I'm proud of the progress you’ve made, and I believe you’re well equipped to face future challenges.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. It feels good to have clarity on my next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoshang! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. Remember that it’s completely normal for challenges to arise, and you can reach out for support anytime in the future. Best of luck, and I believe in your abilities!

User: Thanks! I’ll definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Take care, Xiaoshang! I'm looking forward to hearing about your continued successes. Goodbye for now!

User: Bye!
