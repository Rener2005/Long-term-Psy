Consultant: Hello, Tang. I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, it’s been tough. I still feel very afraid and lonely since the divorce. It's overwhelming, and I find it hard to cope with everything happening around me.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you are still in a lot of emotional pain and facing significant challenges. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or situations make you feel this way?

User: Well, my mind keeps racing with negative thoughts. I often think that I’ll be alone forever and that I’ll never find happiness again. It’s really hard to silence those thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite distressing for you. You mentioned feeling like you might be alone forever—can we explore where those thoughts come from? What evidence do you have that suggests this is true?

User: I guess I just feel stuck. I don’t see how things can get better. After the divorce, I’ve lost my support system, and my friends seem to be distant. It feels like there’s no way out of this loneliness.

Consultant: That’s understandably challenging, especially after such a major life change. It seems like you're interpreting your current social isolation as a sign that you will always be alone. Can we think about any alternative explanations for your situation? 

User: I suppose it could just be a rough period for everyone. But it’s hard not to feel like I've lost everything. 

Consultant: Yes, it can be very easy to view things in a more negative light during tough times. You mentioned that it's hard to see beyond this moment. How about we try to identify any small things that have brought you some comfort or connection recently?

User: I do feel a bit better when I go for walks, but I often just stay at home instead. It’s like I’m too tired to do even the simplest things.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that walks provide you some relief. It’s normal to feel fatigued when you’re experiencing such intense emotions. What if we tried to create a small plan where you could incorporate these walks into your daily routine? 

User: That sounds good, but I worry I won't stick to it. It's hard to motivate myself.

Consultant: Lack of motivation can be a common response to feeling overwhelmed. Let’s break it down into very small steps. What if you started with just a five-minute walk, once a day? No pressure to do more than that, just to help you ease into it.

User: I could try that. Five minutes doesn’t sound too intimidating.

Consultant: That's a positive start! Often, just getting outside for a short time can make a difference in how you feel. As you begin to feel a bit better, you might find it easier to extend those walks. How does that idea resonate with you? 

User: I feel hopeful about it. It’s a small step, but it feels manageable. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Along with physical activity, it might also be helpful to check in with your thoughts during those moments. If any negative thoughts arise, can you consider jotting them down to bring to our next session? 

User: I can definitely do that. Writing things down might help me see them clearer instead of just letting them swirl in my head.

Consultant: Absolutely! Putting thoughts on paper can be powerful. It allows you to process them more clearly and might help in identifying patterns. How do you feel about discussing your emotions surrounding the divorce more deeply next time?

User: I think I need to. I haven’t really unpacked how I feel about it. 

Consultant: That sounds like a productive direction for our next session. Today, we’ve worked on understanding your feelings and identifying small steps forward. How do you feel about the progress we’ve made?

User: I feel a little lighter. It’s nice to talk things out, and I feel like I’m starting to understand my feelings better.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Tang! Remember, it's okay to feel lonely but you're taking steps towards understanding those feelings. Before we wrap up, can we summarize what actions you’re committed to this week?

User: Sure! I’ll try to take a five-minute walk daily and write down any negative thoughts I have. 

Consultant: Excellent! Those are two meaningful actions. I believe that as you continue with these efforts, you'll start to notice small changes in how you feel. I'm here for you when you’re ready to talk again. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support and guidance. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing today, Tang. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. I look forward to seeing you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Tang! It's great to see you again. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of loneliness and frustration. I tried reaching out to my ex-partner, but it didn't go well, which just made me feel more isolated. Work has also been really intense lately, so I’m pretty drained.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that, Tang. It sounds like you’ve had a tough time with both your personal and professional life. Let’s talk about that—what feelings come up for you when you think about your attempts to communicate with your ex?

User: I just feel rejected and abandoned. It’s like I’m trying to engage, but it’s just not working, and that fuels this loneliness I can't shake off.

Consultant: That sounds really painful. It’s understandable to feel rejected, especially when you’re trying to reconnect with someone significant. Could you share more about the thoughts you’re experiencing when you feel lonely? What runs through your mind during those moments?

User: I think things like “I'll never find someone else” or “People don’t really care about me.” It’s like this endless cycle of negative thoughts.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound heavy and quite distressing. Let’s take a moment to examine them together. What evidence do you have to support the belief that “people don’t really care about you”? 

User: Well, it feels true sometimes. My friends seem busy with their own lives, and I don’t want to bother them.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially when feeling low. However, can you think of any times when your friends have been supportive or shown that they care? 

User: Yes, my friends have been there for me during tough times before. They’ve reached out when I was going through the divorce.

Consultant: That’s an important point to acknowledge! It shows that there is evidence that people do care about you. Perhaps we can work on replacing the thought of “People don’t really care about me” with something more balanced, like “Some friends do care and have been supportive.” How does that resonate with you?

User: That does feel a bit better. I guess I can see that not everyone is distant. I just need to reach out when I feel lonely.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reaching out is a great step. Now, let’s talk about some practical ways you can connect with your friends when you’re feeling this way. What activities or conversations come to mind that you might enjoy with them?

User: I used to enjoy playing basketball with a couple of friends. Maybe I could invite them out to shoot some hoops.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really help alleviate feelings of loneliness. Do you think you can set a date with them soon?

User: I can try to text them this week. I just hope they say yes and that we have fun.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, you’re taking the initiative, which is a big step. It’s okay to feel a little anxious about it; just focus on enjoying the time together rather than worrying too much about the outcome.

User: I’ll keep that in mind. What if they can’t make it or if it’s awkward?

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that. If they can’t make it, it doesn’t mean they don’t care. You could consider making it a regular plan, so it doesn’t rely on one outing. As for awkwardness, it happens sometimes, but bringing up shared interests can ease into conversation. 

User: That’s true. I could remind them of old jokes we had. It might break the ice.

Consultant: Exactly! Humor can be a great way to connect. Also, as you go out, remember to give yourself credit for trying. It takes courage to put yourself out there. 

User: I appreciate that. Sometimes I doubt whether I can truly connect with others, especially after everything I’ve been through.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those doubts, but each step you take can build your confidence. Remember, it’s a process, and every small effort counts. 

User: I see that now. I want to focus on being open to these interactions instead of fearing rejection.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy mindset. Perhaps we could also work on a specific way for you to challenge those negative thoughts the next time they arise? 

User: Yes, I’d like that! I feel like I need a strategy to shift those thoughts when they pop up.

Consultant: How about we use a technique called “thought-stopping”? When a negative thought occurs, you can acknowledge it and then consciously replace it with a more supportive thought. 

User: That sounds helpful. I’ll give it a try. 

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s all about practice and reminding yourself of your worth. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway from our session that stands out for you?

User: I think it’s realizing that I can reach out to my friends more and that my negative thoughts aren’t the whole truth. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Tang. You’re making progress, and I believe you’re capable of building those connections. As we move forward, let’s keep working on these strategies together. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more optimistic about my situation.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you face challenges, we can address them in our next session. 

User: I will. Thank you for your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Tang! I look forward to hearing about your experiences and continue working on these goals together. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Tang! It's great to see you today. I know you've been going through some challenging times recently. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to push myself to attend social gatherings, but I still feel that nobody really notices me. It makes me feel even more disappointed and lonely.

Consultant: I can see how that could be really tough for you. When you attend these social events, what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you in those moments?

User: I often think that maybe I'm just not interesting enough for others. It feels like I'm invisible, and that really impacts my mood.

Consultant: That sounds really hard, feeling invisible in social situations. It seems like those thoughts contribute to your sense of disappointment. Can you recall a specific event where you felt this way recently?

User: Yes, I went to a gathering last weekend. I tried to join in the conversations, but I felt like people were just polite and didn’t really engage with me. It left me feeling really down afterward.

Consultant: It's understandable you'd feel down after an experience like that. Let's think about what you were telling yourself during and after the event. What were your automatic thoughts at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I should have been more entertaining or that I wasn’t as good at connecting with people as others. 

Consultant: I hear you. Those self-critical thoughts can make social situations feel even more daunting. How did those thoughts affect your emotions and actions during the gathering?

User: I felt anxious, and it made me withdraw even more. I ended up just standing on the sidelines, not wanting to interact much.

Consultant: It sounds like your feelings of anxiety pushed you to withdraw instead of connecting with others. If you take a moment to reflect, do you think there could be another perspective on how those interactions were going?

User: Maybe I was too focused on how I perceived others viewed me, rather than enjoying the moment and connecting with them.

Consultant: That's an insightful realization, Tang! It’s common to get caught up in our own perceptions. What if you approached future gatherings with the mindset of engaging with others without worrying about how they see you?

User: That makes sense. It could help me relax and just enjoy the conversations. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's practice some strategies to help you feel more engaged and confident. How about we role-play a scenario where you initiate a conversation with someone at a social event?

User: Sure, I’m willing to give that a try.

Consultant: Great! Let's say you meet someone new. How would you start a conversation with them?

User: I might say something like, "Hi, I’m Tang. How do you know the host?"

Consultant: That’s a solid opening! It shows interest in the person and invites conversation. If they respond positively, what might you say next?

User: Maybe I could ask about their hobbies or interests to keep the conversation going.

Consultant: Perfect! Asking open-ended questions can really help develop connections. How do you feel about this approach?

User: It feels manageable. It’s less pressure than trying to come up with something clever right away.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, the goal is to connect with others rather than to impress them. How do you plan to apply this strategy at your next social event?

User: I’ll focus on being genuine and asking questions to get to know others better, rather than worrying about how I’m perceived.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. Let’s think about how you'll prepare for this gathering. Is there anything you can do to set yourself up for success?

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to just be myself and that it's normal to feel anxious sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! That kind of self-compassion can be incredibly helpful. How do you feel about addressing your anxiety before going to these events?

User: I think acknowledging it and telling myself it’s okay to feel that way will help ease some pressure.

Consultant: That’s a very healthy approach! We often underestimate the power of self-acceptance. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to incorporate these strategies moving forward.

User: I’ve learned to focus on engaging with others rather than worrying about how they see me. I’ll practice starting conversations and asking questions, and I'll remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful summary, Tang! I'm really proud of the progress you're making. As you work on these strategies, remember that building connections takes time and practice. Are there any concerns or questions you have before we end our session today?

User: No, I feel a lot more positive about my social skills now. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been great talking with you. I believe you'll continue to make progress in building your social network. Remember, if you ever need support, I'm always here for you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Tang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more open to socializing. I started attending an interest class, and I've met some like-minded people. It's nice to chat and feel accepted, but I still have moments of anxiety about connecting with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive development! It's great to hear you're making new connections. Can you tell me more about those moments of anxiety you experience when trying to connect with others?

User: Sometimes, when I'm in a group, I worry that I might say something awkward or that people won't be interested in what I have to say. It makes me hesitate to join in the conversation.

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to feel anxious about fitting in, especially after significant changes in your life. Let’s explore what thoughts go through your mind in those moments. What do you typically tell yourself when you feel anxious about speaking up?

User: I often think, "What if they find me boring?" or "What if I embarrass myself?" These thoughts make me want to withdraw instead of engaging.

Consultant: Those are some tough thoughts to deal with. It sounds like your mind is being quite critical. I wonder, what evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Have there been moments when people responded positively to you?

User: Actually, yes! In the interest class, people have commented that they enjoy my perspective during discussions. But I still struggle to remember that when anxiety hits.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’ve received positive feedback! It speaks to your ability to contribute meaningfully. When anxiety arises, can you challenge those negative thoughts by reminding yourself of the positive interactions you've had?

User: I suppose I could try that. It just feels hard in the moment.

Consultant: That's understandable, Tang. It can be a challenge when the pressure is on. Let’s practice this together. The next time you feel anxious, try to pause and breathe. Then, ask yourself, “What’s the evidence for and against my negative thoughts?” This can help you gain a different perspective.

User: That sounds like a good strategy. I'll try to remember to pause and evaluate my thoughts. 

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Besides that, have you thought about any activities or ways to further bond with the new people you've met?

User: I was thinking about inviting a few of them to grab coffee or maybe join me for a weekend hike. I hope it helps me get to know them better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Initiating an outing can deepen those connections. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous about how they might respond. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Remember, most people appreciate being invited out. If you’re feeling uncertain, you could even share your feelings with them. Sometimes, being open about our nervousness can help break the ice.

User: That's reassuring! I might say something like, "I’m a bit nervous, but I’d love to hang out."

Consultant: Absolutely! Being honest can foster connection. If they respond well, it could reinforce your confidence. How do you think you might feel after inviting them?

User: I think it would feel really rewarding, even if it goes differently than I expect. It’s a step towards building those relationships.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Focusing on the effort rather than just the outcome can help you build resilience. Let’s keep exploring how you can continue to strengthen these connections. 

User: Yes, I want to keep working on this. Sometimes I still feel that old anxiety creeping back in, especially when I think about making plans.

Consultant: It’s normal for anxiety to revisit us, especially during transitions. When that happens, let’s identify some techniques to cope. For example, have you tried engaging in activities that calm you before reaching out to others?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I usually just try to push through the anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a common approach, but it can be helpful to counters those feelings with calming practices like deep breathing or brief mindfulness exercises. This can help ground you before social interactions and make you feel more centered.

User: I can see how that might help. I’ll make an effort to include some calming activities before I make plans.

Consultant: Great! Incorporating those methods can create a positive cycle. Now, thinking about the social network you're building, how can you maintain contact with those you meet in the interest class?

User: I could create a group chat or regular meet-ups to keep our interactions going. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Regular communication can help reinforce those relationships. How does the thought of initiating that next step feel?

User: It feels encouraging! I think they’d appreciate it, and it would give us a reason to connect more often.

Consultant: Definitely! You’re taking proactive steps toward fostering those connections. Let’s recap what you've learned today: You can challenge negative thoughts, practice coping strategies, and maintain communication with your new friends. 

User: Yes, I’ve learned a lot! I feel more equipped to handle my social anxiety now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Tang. Remember to celebrate your progress. As we wrap up today, how confident are you feeling about applying the skills we've discussed in your social interactions?

User: I feel pretty confident! I believe I can put these strategies into practice and continue to build my relationships.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made impressive strides. Remember, if challenging moments come up, you can always reflect on our sessions. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance, and I feel optimistic about my future and the relationships I’m building.

Consultant: It’s been great to see your progress, and I believe you'll continue to thrive in these new connections. Whenever you need support, feel free to come back. 

User: I will! Thank you again for everything.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tang! I'm glad to see you again for this session. I remember last time we spoke about settling into your new single life and focusing on your career. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite good, actually. The anxiety has lessened a lot compared to before. I’m starting to enjoy my time alone, and I’m exploring my hobbies more.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making positive strides in adjusting to your single life. What hobbies or interests have you been focusing on lately?

User: I've started painting again. It’s been really therapeutic, and I feel more connected to my creativity. I also joined a local book club, which helps me meet new people.

Consultant: Painting and joining a book club sound like fantastic ways to express yourself and connect with others. How do these activities contribute to your overall life satisfaction?

User: They really help me feel more engaged and grounded. The painting allows me to express my feelings, while the book club gives me a sense of community. I feel less isolated.

Consultant: It seems these activities have provided you with both a creative outlet and social connection. As you continue to reflect on these positive changes, what areas do you think you might want to focus on more moving forward?

User: I think I want to set some personal development goals, especially in my career. I’m feeling motivated to push myself toward new opportunities.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Setting personal development goals can provide you with a sense of purpose and direction. What specific goals do you have in mind for your career?

User: I’d like to consider taking on more complex cases and possibly pursuing a leadership position at my firm. I want to challenge myself and grow professionally.

Consultant: Challenging yourself in your career is an excellent way to foster growth. Let’s explore what steps you can take toward achieving those goals. Have you identified any skills or experiences you might need to develop further for those positions?

User: I think improving my negotiation skills would be crucial. Also, I want to gain more experience in managing a team since I haven’t had that opportunity yet.

Consultant: Those are insightful observations, Tang. Developing negotiation skills and gaining team management experience will certainly prepare you for a leadership role. How do you feel about seeking out opportunities for training in those areas?

User: I think I should look for workshops or courses. It’s just a bit overwhelming to figure out where to start.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Perhaps we can break it down into smaller steps. Would you be willing to research one or two workshops or courses this week?

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I could set a specific time to look into it and write down my options.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By taking small, actionable steps, you can maintain a sense of control over your professional development. What will you do if you feel overwhelmed again while pursuing these goals?

User: If I feel anxious or overwhelmed, I’ll try to remind myself to take it one step at a time and maybe practice some mindfulness to calm myself down.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Mindfulness can be a useful tool to manage anxiety. How comfortable do you feel practicing mindfulness regularly?

User: I’ve tried some mindfulness exercises before, but I haven't made it a routine yet. I think I could commit to doing it a few times a week.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can greatly enhance its effectiveness. Perhaps you could set aside a specific time each week for mindfulness practice. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I can try that. Maybe every morning before I start my day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Starting your day with mindfulness can set a positive tone. As we look toward the future, what do you think will help you maintain the progress you've made in your personal life and career?

User: I believe staying connected with my interests and being mindful of my goals will be important. Also, keeping up with the social connections I've made will help me avoid isolation.

Consultant: Staying connected to your interests and social circles is vital for your well-being. As we summarize our session today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway regarding your journey so far?

User: I think I realize that I have the power to shape my future. Setting goals and pursuing my interests helps me feel more in control.

Consultant: Absolutely, Tang! Recognizing your agency in shaping your future is a significant step in your journey. Moving forward, what strategies will you put in place to continue this proactive approach?

User: I’ll focus on setting clear, achievable goals, and make sure to celebrate small successes along the way. I want to keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Celebrating small successes will help reinforce your progress. As we wrap up today, do you feel prepared to continue working towards your personal development goals?

User: Yes, I do feel more prepared. Thank you for helping me clarify my thoughts and plans!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad I could support you today. Remember, you can always reach out if you need guidance in the future. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tang! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been doing a bit better, actually. I’ve been reflecting on my past experiences, and while there are still some emotional echoes from my divorce, I feel more rational about it now. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Tang. Acknowledging those feelings and developing a more rational perspective is significant. With all the recent changes in your life, how would you assess your overall progress and mental resilience?

User: I think I've gotten stronger, especially with my social skills. I am able to engage more with my colleagues after getting the promotion, and it feels rewarding. But sometimes I still doubt myself.

Consultant: It's excellent to hear that you’re feeling more confident professionally. Doubt is something many people experience, especially after significant changes. Can you tell me more about what triggers those self-doubts?

User: Usually, it's when I'm faced with new tasks. I worry that I might not handle them well, which leads to feelings of insecurity. I keep comparing myself to others, which doesn't help.

Consultant: That sense of comparison can be tough. It often distorts our self-view and can lead to negative thinking patterns. What kind of thoughts do you notice when you start comparing yourself to others?

User: I think things like, “I’m not as capable as they are,” or “I don't deserve this position.” It makes me anxious about taking action on my responsibilities.

Consultant: It's important to recognize those thoughts as they arise. Would you say there’s strong evidence to support those beliefs? Or could there be alternative explanations for your capabilities?

User: I know I’ve achieved this position based on my skills and efforts. There's feedback from my colleagues which supports that I’m doing well, but I still can't shake off those negative thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like there is a contradiction between your accomplishments and the negative thoughts you’re experiencing. Let's challenge those beliefs together. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them to think in this situation?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and remember their past successes. But it’s easier said than done for me.

Consultant: Exactly, it can be challenging to apply the same logic to ourselves. Let's try to list some concrete achievements that you can remind yourself of whenever those doubts creep in. What do you think stands out the most?

User: Well, successfully managing a recent project and receiving positive feedback from my boss comes to mind. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! Let’s focus on that success. When self-doubt arises, how about you remind yourself of that achievement? Can you think of a practical way to keep that in mind?

User: Maybe I could jot down some of these achievements in a journal. I could read through them when I feel insecure.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! A journal can help reinforce your positive experiences. Alongside this, how about incorporating some positive affirmations related to your professional strengths?

User: I like that idea. Writing affirmations might help me stay grounded in my capabilities.

Consultant: Wonderful! You’re taking proactive steps towards reinforcing your self-esteem. As we progress, what other areas do you think we should focus on to maintain your mental well-being?

User: I want to ensure I can manage stress better as more responsibilities come my way at work. I’d like strategies for that.

Consultant: Sure! We can explore some stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or time management strategies, which can be incredibly beneficial in high-pressure situations. Have you tried any techniques in the past?

User: I’ve dabbled in meditation but often find it hard to maintain a routine. 

Consultant: Maintaining a routine can indeed be challenging, but we can start small. Maybe just a few minutes daily could help? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds more attainable. I think I can commit to a few minutes each day.

Consultant: Fantastic! We’ll build on that routine gradually. Plus, let's set a small goal for how you'll track your journaling and meditation. Keeping track of your progress can boost your motivation.

User: I can keep a calendar where I mark days I manage to meditate or write in my journal. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Visualizing progress often reinforces the commitment. As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on what you've achieved throughout our discussions. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway today?

User: I feel more confident acknowledging my achievements and planning strategies for managing self-doubt and stress. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that! You've made significant progress in recognizing your strengths and planning for the future. Remember, maintaining this awareness is key to long-term success. 

User: Thank you! I feel empowered to move forward now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Tang! You have developed some strong tools to navigate your journey. If you encounter challenges, remember you can always reach out for support. This wraps up our session today—make sure to celebrate your achievements. 

User: Thank you again! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure, Tang! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
