Consultant: Hello there, I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I don't know… I just feel really lonely at school. I haven't made any good friends, and I miss the way my family used to be when my parents were together. 

Consultant: It sounds tough to feel that loneliness, especially with so much change at home. You mentioned missing your family before. Can you tell me more about what that feels like for you?

User: Well, I just want things to go back to how they were. I feel sad when I see other kids laughing with their friends. I wish I had someone like that too. 

Consultant: I understand that these feelings can be really overwhelming. Wanting to have close relationships is a natural desire. How do you feel when you notice that other kids seem to be having fun?

User: I feel really left out and sometimes I worry that maybe there's something wrong with me. What if nobody wants to be my friend?

Consultant: It’s common to have those kinds of worries when you feel isolated. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way? 

User: I often think that I’m not interesting or fun enough for people to want to be friends with me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a really heavy thought to carry. What evidence do you have that supports this idea that you’re not interesting or fun?

User: I guess I don't have any… it's just how I feel sometimes. 

Consultant: It’s important to notice that feelings aren’t always facts. If a friend of yours said they felt that way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they are fun and nice, and they just need to find the right people. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a kind and supportive view towards others. How can we apply that same understanding to yourself? 

User: Maybe I should try to think that way about myself too. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! Can you think of a time when you felt good about yourself or when you enjoyed being with others?

User: There was that time during art class when I showed my drawing. My classmates liked it, and I felt happy.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful memory! Holding onto those moments can be really valuable. What if we could build on that feeling when you think about making new friends?

User: I guess I could remember that I do have something special to share. 

Consultant: Yes, and you do! What are some things you enjoy doing outside of school that you could share with others? 

User: I like drawing and reading. 

Consultant: Those are great interests! How about this: next time you’re at school, you could share your drawing with someone or talk about your favorite book. Would you be open to trying that?

User: That sounds a little scary, but I guess I could try. 

Consultant: That's totally understandable. Sharing can feel intimidating. We can also practice how you might approach someone. Would practicing feel helpful for you?

User: Yeah, I think that would be good. 

Consultant: Alright! Let’s do a little role-play. Imagine you see someone sitting alone. What could you say to start a conversation?

User: Maybe I could say, "Hi! I like your backpack. Where did you get it?"

Consultant: That’s a great opener! It’s light and friendly. What do you think the other person might say?

User: They might say thank you, and then we could talk about it?

Consultant: Exactly! It's a beautiful way to open up dialogue and find common ground. How do you feel about using this approach at school?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it like that. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Building confidence takes time, and you’re already taking steps in the right direction. What is one small action you can commit to trying this week?

User: I could try talking to one person during lunch. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! After you try it, let’s discuss how it went during our next session. How does that sound? 

User: Okay! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Great to hear! Remember, each step you take matters, and I’m here to support you through this journey. You’re doing a fantastic job. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open and willing to work on this. I look forward to our next conversation. 

User: Me too! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your new friendship at school?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious. I made a new friend, but she doesn’t reach out much, and I worry that she doesn't like me. I doubt my social skills and I'm scared I can’t keep the friendship going.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling uncertain and anxious about this new friendship. It’s completely normal to have these feelings. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you don't hear from her?

User: I think maybe she thinks I'm boring or annoying. Sometimes I wish she would message me, but then I feel disappointed when she doesn’t. I start to wonder if I'll ever have good friends.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really heavy. You mentioned thinking that she finds you boring or annoying; how does that make you feel about yourself in those moments?

User: It makes me feel sad and insecure. I start to think that maybe I’m not good enough for her or anyone else.

Consultant: I understand that must feel really difficult. But let's explore this idea a bit. Is there any evidence that supports the thought that you're not good enough for her?

User: I don’t know… I mean, I guess I do have some fun things to talk about sometimes. But when I’m nervous, I can’t think of anything good to say.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize that you have fun things to share! Feeling nervous is a common experience, especially when building new friendships. What happens when you’re in those nervous moments? 

User: I just kind of freeze and don’t say much. I feel like everyone is judging me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. What if we try to challenge that thought? If someone was feeling nervous like you were, how do you think they could handle that situation better?

User: Maybe they could try to just relax or think of a topic ahead of time to talk about.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful approach! Preparing topics in advance can really help ease the pressure. What kinds of topics do you think you could prepare that might interest her?

User: I could talk about our favorite movies or hobbies. I know she likes drawing because I saw her do it in class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing common interests can often strengthen friendships. How do you feel about initiating a conversation with her about drawing next time?

User: I’m a bit scared, but I think if I can just do it, it might be okay.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! It’s perfectly natural to feel scared, but taking that first step can be really empowering. What small action could you take to make this feel less overwhelming?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say before I talk to her. It might help me feel ready.

Consultant: Practicing is a wonderful strategy! How about planning to have a fun drawing conversation with her during your next break at school?

User: I think I could do that. It feels a bit easier to think about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, building friendships takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps. As you engage more, do you think that your confidence could start to grow?

User: Yes, I hope so. I really want to try and not give up.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! I believe that with practice and patience, you’ll build your confidence. Can we think about some other techniques you could use if you start to feel nervous again?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths or remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are both effective techniques! Deep breathing can really help calm your nerves, and reminding yourself that making mistakes is part of learning can shift your focus. 

User: Yes, I will try those! I want to feel happier about making friends.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Xiaohong. Remember, it’s a journey, and every little step counts. In our next session, we can discuss how your conversation with her went and any new feelings or thoughts that come up. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel a bit more hopeful now. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! I appreciate your openness today. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Consultant: Hi Xiao Hong! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately about the social activities at school?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit better because I want to join the school activities, but I still feel really shy and unsure of myself. I didn't manage to participate well last time.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you want to join the activities! Feeling shy can be tough. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically made you feel unsure during your last attempt?

User: I think I wanted to join the art club. But when I got there, I felt everyone was already friends, and I didn’t know how to talk to them. It made me feel really nervous.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel that way in a new environment. Let’s explore this feeling a bit more—what was going through your mind at that moment when you felt nervous?

User: I thought they wouldn’t like me or accept me. I kept worrying that I would say something stupid.

Consultant: It sounds like those worries made it hard for you to approach them. Would you say these thoughts about not being accepted are quite common for you, especially in social situations?

User: Yes, I often think that way. It makes me feel like just staying quiet instead of trying to join in.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can really hold you back. Let’s try to challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t like you? Have you met anyone who seemed welcoming?

User: Once, a girl smiled at me during class, but I still didn’t talk to her. I guess I don’t really know them yet, so it’s hard to say.

Consultant: That smile could be a sign that they might be friendly! Sometimes, reaching out can lead to surprising friendships. How do you think your feelings might change if you took a small step to say hi next time?

User: I guess if I just said hello, it wouldn't feel as scary. But what if they ignore me?

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about that, but often people are more open than we think. How about we set a small goal for you? One way to practice could be to greet one person at your next session. How does that sound?

User: That might be okay! Just saying hello seems easier.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s a great start. We can also practice some simple greetings here, and you can choose one that feels comfortable. Would you like to try that now?

User: Sure! I can practice saying hi to you. Hi!

Consultant: That was really good! It’s a great start! Now imagine doing that with someone new at school. What might that feel like for you?

User: Maybe a bit exciting? I guess it could feel nice if they smiled back.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling excited and hopeful is a fantastic mindset. Remember, it’s okay not to be perfect right away. Each small step counts. Let’s focus on this—what will you do next time you’re in a social setting?

User: I’ll try to say hi to someone. If I feel brave, maybe I’ll ask about the activity too.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Xiao Hong! Asking about the activity is a great way to break the ice. When you think about this plan, how does it make you feel now compared to before?

User: I feel a bit more confident! It seems less scary thinking about it like this.

Consultant: I’m really happy to hear that! Building your confidence takes time and practice. What other strategies do you think could help you feel even more comfortable?

User: Maybe I could talk to my mom about this? She might give me tips or even go with me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Having support can make a big difference. Your mom could help encourage you and might even join you at times. How would you feel about discussing this with her?

User: I think it would help to talk about it. She might come up with ideas too.

Consultant: Absolutely! She knows you well and can be a great ally. Before we wrap up today, let’s talk about how you can keep building on this positive feeling. What are you willing to practice until we meet again?

User: I’ll practice saying hi and maybe ask a couple of questions. I’ll also talk to my mom about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remember to celebrate each small effort you make. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel good! It was nice to talk about this and have a plan. I’m excited to try!

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking these steps, Xiao Hong. I believe you will do great! Keep in mind, it’s normal to feel nervous, but you're capable of facing these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! I'm so glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better. I invited some classmates over to play, and we had a really fun time together. It felt nice to make friends.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you had a great experience strengthening those friendships. How did it feel for you to invite them over?

User: I felt excited! But also a little nervous before they arrived. I didn’t know if they would have fun or like my place.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous in those situations. You took a big step by inviting them over! After they left, how did you feel about the time you spent together?

User: I felt happy! We played games and laughed a lot. It made me want to have more friends over again.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Your joy in the experience is a great sign. What do you think you could do next to build on this new friendship?

User: Maybe I can invite them again or ask if they want to play together at school sometime.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Inviting them again can help deepen your connection. What would it be like for you to practice inviting them again?

User: It sounds a bit scary, but also exciting. I think I could ask them to come over next weekend.

Consultant: It’s totally okay to feel scared, but it also seems like you're ready to give it a try! What could you say to them to make the invitation easier?

User: I could just say, "Do you want to come to my house and play again next weekend?" That sounds simple enough.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Making it simple can often take away some of the pressure. If they can't make it, how might you feel?

User: I think I would feel a little disappointed, but it's okay. I can always try again.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Rejection can be tough, but knowing you can try again is important. What other social activities would you like to explore to expand your circle of friends?

User: I think joining some clubs or groups at school could help. Maybe art or sports. I like those things!

Consultant: Joining a club is a great idea! What do you think would be your first step towards doing that?

User: I could talk to my teacher or look for flyers in school about clubs. 

Consultant: Exactly! Talking to your teacher is a proactive step. What might you say when you approach your teacher?

User: I could say, "Hello! I’m interested in joining a club. Could you tell me more about what’s available?"

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! It shows your enthusiasm. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also feel good about it. I really want to make more friends.

Consultant: Your desire to create friendships is commendable, and it's great you're willing to step out of your comfort zone. How might you celebrate your courage after trying out these new approaches?

User: I could treat myself to something I like after! Maybe my favorite snack or spend extra time doing something fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice reward! Celebrating your efforts can reinforce your positive experiences. How did you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more confident and excited about making new friends now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohong! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Remember, each small step counts, and I believe you’re capable of creating wonderful friendships. Let's plan to meet again next week to talk about how things went!

User: Yes! I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for helping me!

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I made a new friend at school during an activity, and I'm proud of how I interacted with them. It felt exciting!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re feeling more confident in your social skills. What did you enjoy most about interacting with your new friend?

User: I liked that we joked around and shared similar interests! It was nice to feel comfortable with someone new.

Consultant: That’s great! Comfort in new friendships is so important. How do you think this experience has changed the way you view your social abilities?

User: I think I’m starting to believe I can make friends easily. I used to feel shy, but now I feel like I can just be myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Embracing your true self is crucial in making connections. Is there anything specific you’d like to do to nurture this new friendship?

User: I'd really like to invite them over to play games! I think it would be fun for us to hang out more.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun plan! How do you feel about taking this step to invite them over?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. What if they don’t want to come or don’t enjoy it?

Consultant: It's natural to feel a bit anxious, but remember, you’ve already made a great connection. What evidence do you have that they might not enjoy it?

User: I don’t really have any evidence. I guess I’m just worried about being rejected.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those worries. However, focusing on the fun aspects of the invitation could help. What do you think you could say to make it inviting?

User: Maybe I could say, "Hey, want to come over and play some games? I think it will be fun!" 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful invitation! It’s casual and friendly. How would you feel after sending that invite?

User: I think I would feel relieved and excited. It would be nice to see what they say!

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Regardless of their response, you’re taking an important step towards building a friendship. How do you plan to handle their response if it isn’t what you hope for?

User: I guess I could just ask if there’s another day that works for them. I’d still want to be friends!

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to look at it! Flexibility in friendships can strengthen your bond. Now, how have you been feeling about your home life since we last spoke?

User: Things are okay. My mom is really supportive. I like having her around, but sometimes I wish my dad was more involved.

Consultant: It’s good to hear your mom is supportive. It’s normal to wish for more involvement from your dad. How do you think you can express these feelings to your parents?

User: I think I could just tell them that I would like to spend more time with my dad. Maybe we could plan something fun together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Communicating your wishes can help your parents understand how you feel. What activities do you think would be fun to do with your dad?

User: Maybe going to the arcade or having a movie night! I think that would be fun together.

Consultant: These ideas sound enjoyable! Planning a specific activity can make it easier to express your feelings. How are you feeling about approaching these conversations with your parents?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I really want to try. I think it could make things better.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Xiaohong! Taking action towards what you want can lead to positive changes. Let’s reflect on this: what have you learned about yourself through these experiences so far?

User: I’ve learned that I can be more open and confident in my friendships and that it’s okay to share my feelings with my family.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Realizing your ability to be open can greatly enhance your relationships. How can you continue to build on these positive changes in your life?

User: I want to keep inviting my friend over and talk openly with my mom and dad. I think that will help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Absolutely! Staying engaged with your friends and family is a wonderful way to enhance your connections. As we wrap up, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session today?

User: I feel encouraged to take steps in my friendships and family interactions. I’m excited to see where this goes!

Consultant: That's fantastic, Xiaohong! I'm proud of your progress. Keep nurturing those connections and expressing your needs. Remember, you’re growing every day. If you ever need support, I'm here for you.

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, actually. My relationship with my dad has gotten better, and I can tell him about funny things that happen at school now. My mom and I also talk more openly.

Consultant: That sounds really positive! It's great that you're feeling more connected with both your dad and your mom. What do you think has helped you make those changes?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regularly sharing your experiences can help maintain those strong connections. Are there any other strategies you think could help you stay open with your feelings?

User: Maybe I could write down my thoughts in a diary. Sometimes I think better when I write.

Consultant: Writing can be a powerful way to sort through your emotions. It can help you identify what you want to discuss with your parents. How might you feel about starting a diary?

User: I think it could be really fun! And it might help me see if there are any worries I’m still holding onto.

Consultant: Journaling sounds like a great idea. It could also provide you with a tool to reflect on your feelings before sharing them. What are you most excited about in your life right now?

User: I’m really looking forward to the upcoming school trip! I can’t wait to share that experience with my dad.

User: Yes, I feel really good about it. I’m excited to keep talking with my family.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve done a wonderful job today. Just remember, if you ever feel unsure, reaching out to someone you trust can make a difference. I’m here to support you anytime. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.
