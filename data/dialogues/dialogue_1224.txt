Consultant: Hello Xiao Qiang! I'm glad you could make it today. Let's take some time to talk about how you've been feeling lately. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling really lost. Since starting college, my grades have slipped, and I keep thinking that I'm disappointing my parents. I sometimes wonder if I even want to go on.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and disappointment. It's challenging to feel this way, especially after all your hard work in high school. Can you share more about what you think is causing these feelings?

User: I just can’t seem to adapt to the environment here. Back in high school, I had a routine and support from teachers. Now, I feel completely on my own. It's overwhelming, and I don’t know how to manage it.

Consultant: That feeling of being overwhelmed and alone is understandable, especially with such a big transition. Let’s explore your thoughts around this new environment. What specifically about college feels overwhelming to you?

User: Everything feels different—the classes, the independence, and the fact that there’s no one pushing me to study. I feel like I've lost control over my studies.

Consultant: Losing that sense of control can be very distressing. You mentioned that there’s no one pushing you to study. How do you feel about taking that responsibility on yourself?

User: Honestly, it feels heavy. I try, but I just end up procrastinating. I feel like I'm just wasting time and not getting anywhere.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Procrastination can be a common response when we're feeling overwhelmed. When you think about procrastinating, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I’ll just fail anyway, so what's the point? Or I convince myself that I can handle it later, but later never comes.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite discouraging. They might be leading to a cycle where you feel stuck. What would it feel like to challenge those thoughts? For instance, could there be a possibility that things could turn out better than you expect?

User: I suppose I haven’t really thought about it that way. I just feel like I'm bound to fail.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a strong belief that you will fail. Let’s examine that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that supports this belief, and is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: Well, I’ve failed some exams, but I also did well in high school. There have been times when I succeeded, but I just keep fixating on the negatives.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s easy to focus on the negatives, but it's important to recognize your successes as well. How can we work together to reframe that perspective? 

User: Maybe I could try to remember my past successes more often, but it feels hard when I'm in this bleak state.

Consultant: It can be tough to shift perspective when you’re feeling low. What small steps can you take to remind yourself of those past achievements? 

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down positive experiences or things I achieve each day, no matter how small.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Documenting your achievements can help you reflect on your progress. How does that make you feel about managing your studies going forward?

User: It feels like a step in the right direction. It might help motivate me a bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time. Would you be willing to set a specific goal for your studies this week, perhaps tied to your journal?

User: I think I’ll aim to read a chapter of a textbook every day and write about it in my journal.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable goal! How do you feel about having this plan in place?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It seems more manageable than what I’ve been trying to do.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Hope can be a powerful motivator. As you implement this plan, let’s also discuss how you can handle the inevitable setbacks or challenges. What do you think you could do if things don’t go as planned?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to fail sometimes. I just need to learn from it instead of letting it drag me down.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Learning from setbacks is key to growth. As we wrap up our session today, what have been your biggest takeaways?

User: I need to focus more on my strengths and remember that it’s okay to face challenges. Keeping a journal could really help me with that.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights, Xiao Qiang. I believe you have the potential to adapt and thrive in this new environment. Remember, it's a process. If you need more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel much better. It was nice to talk through these issues, and I actually feel like I have a plan now!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! I’m here whenever you need to talk again. You’re making progress, and I believe in your ability to keep moving forward.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Qiang! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I've reviewed our last conversation, and I see you've been experimenting with new study methods. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Honestly, I'm feeling pretty frustrated. I've tried different techniques, but nothing seems to work for me. I still can't keep up with my studies, and I feel like I'm really struggling.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel frustrated when things don't go as planned. Can you share a bit more about the specific techniques you've tried and what thoughts have been running through your mind during this process?

User: I've tried using flashcards and setting timers for study sessions, but I keep getting distracted or overwhelmed. I think I just keep telling myself that I'm not smart enough to learn this material.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some really tough thoughts there, especially about your intelligence. When you say you're "not smart enough," what kind of emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and defeated. I feel like I should be able to handle this since I did well in high school, but now I keep failing.

Consultant: Feeling anxious and defeated in the face of this challenge is a natural response. It's important to recognize that transitioning to a new environment, like university, can be difficult. Do you believe there might be some other factors influencing your ability to adapt beyond your intelligence?

User: Maybe. I guess I'm just not used to being in such a different environment and learning style. I thought I could just keep working hard like I did in high school, but it seems like that's not enough anymore.

Consultant: That realization can be quite tough, but it can also open the door to adjusting your approach. What would it look like for you to give yourself permission to adapt your study methods instead of feeling like you have to stick to just one?

User: I suppose it would feel a bit relieving. But I’m still worried about how much time I am losing trying to figure this out.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about time lost. However, every effort you make is actually a step toward finding what works best for you. Could you share what your ideal study situation looks like when you're feeling motivated and productive?

User: I think when I can study in a group and discuss things with others, I feel more engaged. It's just hard to find the right people to study with.

Consultant: Studying in a group can indeed be really motivating! What if we brainstormed some strategies together to help you connect with others for study sessions? 

User: That could help! Maybe I need to reach out to classmates or join study groups.

Consultant: Absolutely! That could open up opportunities for collaboration. What are some specific steps you might take to do that?

User: I guess I could start by talking to people in my classes, or checking to see if my university has study groups I can join.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent first steps! As you think about making these connections, how can you frame your expectations about your performance during these study sessions?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that it's okay not to understand everything right away, and that learning is a process.

Consultant: Exactly! Learning is definitely a journey, and it's great that you're recognizing that. Keeping a mindset that focuses on progress rather than perfection can help reduce some of that anxiety. 

User: Yes, I think that makes sense. I’ll try to remind myself to take things one step at a time.

Consultant: That's a powerful approach! As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the biggest takeaway or action plan you can implement moving forward?

User: I think I should focus on reaching out to others and trying to study in groups while being patient with myself. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Xiao Qiang! I'm really proud of your willingness to adapt and try new methods. Remember, it’s all about gradual progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about things now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Keep that hope alive, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need more support. We'll check in on how these strategies work for you in our next session. 

User: Absolutely! Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, Xiao Qiang, and I look forward to our next conversation.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqiang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling about your studies and your participation in the study group?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more hopeful lately since joining the study group. But sometimes I still struggle to keep up, especially with adjusting to the new methods of learning. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful! Joining a study group can be a wonderful way to gain support and motivation. When you say you're struggling to keep up, can you tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing?

User: Well, I often feel lost during discussions. I worry that my ideas won't be good enough or that I might not contribute as much as others do.

Consultant: Those feelings of uncertainty can be tough to handle. You're putting yourself out there in a group setting, and it’s natural to have doubts. Can you think of any specific examples when you felt lost during a discussion? What was going through your mind at that moment?

User: There was this one time when we were discussing a complex topic, and I had some thoughts, but I hesitated to share them. I kept thinking, "What if my ideas are wrong?" That made me feel anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation made you feel anxious and held back. It's important to recognize those automatic thoughts, like fearing that your ideas might be wrong. Let’s explore how those thoughts impact your feelings. How did it feel to not share your thoughts in that discussion?

User: I felt frustrated and a bit embarrassed. I wanted to contribute, but that fear held me back.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated in that situation. The fear of judgment can limit our desire to participate. What if we tried identifying that specific thought—“What if my ideas are wrong?”—and looked for evidence to question it? 

User: Okay, that sounds interesting. But I still often think my ideas just aren't as good as others'.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, and it can be beneficial to ask yourself, “Is there any evidence that my ideas are worse than others?” If a friend shared a similar worry, how would you respond to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone's perspective is valuable, and they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! What you would say to a friend can often apply to yourself. Now, let's try a little exercise together. Next time you find yourself thinking, "What if my ideas are wrong?", can you respond to that thought with, “Everyone has different perspectives, and mine is valid too”? 

User: I can try that. It makes sense to support myself like I would a friend.

Consultant: Great! Remember, practice is key. Each time you participate in discussions, reinforce that supportive message to yourself. How do you feel about approaching the next group discussion with this mindset?

User: It feels encouraging. I think I might be able to open up more.

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude! Additionally, can you also share an experience from the group that went well? What do you think contributed to that success?

User: Last week, I shared my thoughts on a topic, and my classmates responded positively. They even built on my ideas, and it felt nice to be engaged.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Recognizing moments like that can help build your confidence. How can you build on that positive experience in future discussions?

User: I guess I can remind myself that when I share, it might lead to good discussions, just like last time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering those positive interactions can create a positive feedback loop. Moving forward, we can work on building your confidence and participation in the group. What specific goals do you want to set for your upcoming sessions?

User: I want to aim to share at least one idea in each discussion and maybe also encourage others to share too.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Not only does sharing boost your own confidence, but encouraging others can also strengthen the group dynamic. How does that feel to commit to that plan?

User: It feels good! I'm excited to try it out.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too! Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re going to practice challenging negative thoughts, remind yourself of your contributions, and aim to share ideas in your group discussions. 

User: Yes, I’m ready to give it a try!

Consultant: Wonderful! I believe you have the potential to thrive with this new approach. Let’s meet again soon to talk about your progress. Remember, each step you take is a step towards building your confidence and enjoyment in learning.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoqiang. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in the study group. Keep up the great work, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqiang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi! I've actually been quite excited. I recently started taking some elective courses, and I really enjoy the new subjects. I also made some friends in class, which has been great.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're finding joy in learning and building connections. Can you tell me more about what specifically excites you about these new subjects?

User: I think it's just the way the teachers present the material. It's so different from high school. The subjects are stimulating, and I feel like I can think critically about what I'm learning.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Engaging with material that ignites your curiosity can be really rewarding. How does that influence your motivation to study?

User: It definitely boosts my motivation. I find myself wanting to study more and keep up with the assignments, which is a big change from how I felt in some of my other classes.

Consultant: It's great that you've noticed a change in your motivation. How do you think this newfound interest could impact your overall academic performance moving forward?

User: I hope it will help me stay on top of my coursework and maybe even improve my grades. I feel like I have a better attitude towards learning now.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset to have. Have you set any specific goals for yourself in these new subjects to help maintain this momentum?

User: Not yet, but I think I should. I want to focus on doing well in these electives and maybe explore more subjects that interest me.

Consultant: Setting goals is an excellent idea! It can provide a clearer path for your learning. What kind of specific achievements would you like to aim for in your electives?

User: I’d love to get good grades, but I also want to participate more in discussions and maybe lead a project with my classmates.

Consultant: Those sound like achievable goals! Participating more actively can also help build your confidence. How do you feel about leading a project?

User: To be honest, I feel a bit nervous about it. What if I fail, or what if my classmates don’t take me seriously?

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way, especially when taking on new responsibilities. Let's explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that suggests your classmates might not take you seriously?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence; it’s just a fear. They seem really capable and confident.

Consultant: It's common to compare ourselves to others and feel inadequate. Can you think of times when you’ve successfully contributed to group work in the past?

User: Yes, I remember working on a project in high school. I really contributed and felt like I had a valuable perspective.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that you have something to offer. What if you remind yourself of that experience when you start to feel unsure about leading a project?

User: I could definitely try that. Thinking about my high school experience helps a lot.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Also, remember that everyone brings unique skills to a team. You could invite your classmates to share their ideas, which could help build rapport. How do you feel about collaborating with them?

User: I like that idea. Collaborating could actually make it easier for me to lead, and I wouldn’t feel so much pressure on myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Teamwork can enhance the experience for everyone involved. Let’s talk about your social circle as well. How has connecting with your classmates impacted your confidence outside of academics?

User: I feel like I’m slowly building friendships, and I enjoy those interactions. It makes my time at school more enjoyable.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiaoqiang! Having friends can provide support and enhance your overall experience. Have these new connections inspired you to take on new challenges?

User: Yes, I think having a support system motivates me to step out of my comfort zone more than before.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It's amazing how friendships can encourage personal growth. As we wrap up, let’s outline a plan for your goals moving forward. What steps can you take in the coming weeks to continue building on this positive momentum?

User: I’ll set some specific goals for my electives, participate more in class discussions, and maybe start planning a group project. I’ll also work on reminding myself of my strengths.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on your strengths will undoubtedly support your confidence. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient with yourself. I’m looking forward to hearing about your developments in our next session!

User: Thank you! I’m really excited to see how these steps will help me. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqiang! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to hearing about your recent experiences. How have things been for you since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. Being part of the academic club has boosted my confidence quite a bit. I've been involved in organizing events, and it's nice to see that my efforts are paying off.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s fantastic to hear how your involvement in the club has had a positive impact on your self-confidence and your ability to organize events. Can you share some specific experiences that made you feel this way?

User: Sure! Last week, I helped coordinate a guest speaker event. I was really nervous at first, but everything went smoothly, and I received a lot of positive feedback from my peers.

Consultant: It’s impressive that you stepped up to coordinate the event! Receiving positive feedback must have felt rewarding. How did that experience change how you view your abilities in a group setting?

User: It made me realize that I can actually lead and bring people together. I used to doubt my leadership skills, but now I feel more capable and even excited about future projects.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in perspective! It sounds like you’re beginning to recognize your capabilities as a leader. What specific skills do you think you've developed through this experience?

User: I think I've improved my communication skills and learned how to delegate tasks better. I used to try to do everything myself, but now I see the value in collaboration.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're recognizing the importance of collaboration and delegation. That’s a critical skill in any group activity. How do you feel about asking others for help or input now compared to before?

User: I feel much more comfortable asking for help now. I understand that it doesn’t make me look weak; it actually shows that I value my teammates' contributions.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Valuing the contributions of others is key to effective teamwork. As you continue to lead in the club, what do you think are some challenges you might face moving forward?

User: I think I might struggle with balancing club activities and my academic responsibilities. Sometimes I worry about falling behind in my studies.

Consultant: Balancing multiple responsibilities can be challenging. It's important to find a rhythm that works for you. Can you think of strategies that might help you manage your time effectively between club activities and your studies?

User: I could set specific study times and stick to them. Maybe I can also create a schedule that allocates time for both studying and club activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating a schedule can help you stay organized and ensure that you make time for both your studies and your club involvement. How do you feel about implementing this plan?

User: I feel optimistic! Having a clear schedule will definitely help me feel more in control and less anxious about my workload.

Consultant: It sounds like you're on the right track. It’s great to hear that you're feeling more in control. As you implement this schedule, what will you do to hold yourself accountable?

User: I could share my schedule with a friend in the club. That way, we can check in on each other and make sure we're both staying on track.

Consultant: Sharing your schedule is an excellent idea! It creates a support system and helps keep you accountable. How do you think having that support will impact your efforts?

User: I think it will keep me motivated since I won’t be doing it alone. Plus, we can encourage each other if either of us starts to fall behind.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a support system can make a significant difference. Let’s reflect on how your experiences in the club have helped you develop these skills and confidence. What do you think you've learned about yourself through this process?

User: I’ve learned that I’m capable of more than I thought. I didn’t realize I had leadership potential, and now I’m excited to explore it further.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Recognizing your potential is a huge step forward. As you move ahead, how can you continue to build on this confidence and leadership skill?

User: I could take on more responsibilities in our club projects and seek feedback after each event to see how I can improve.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Seeking feedback will provide valuable insights and help you grow even further. As we wrap up our session, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I think the main takeaway is that I have the ability to balance my responsibilities and continue developing my skills, and I feel confident about that.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization, Xiaoqiang! I'm proud of the progress you've made and the way you're approaching your challenges. As you continue this journey, remember to celebrate the small wins along the way. If you find yourself needing support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more prepared now to tackle both my studies and club activities.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress in our next session. Take care!

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good actually. I’ve found a rhythm in my school life and am quite satisfied with my recent progress, especially with my grades improving.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant strides. What specific changes do you think contributed to your improvement in grades?

User: I think I've been more focused and organized with my study schedule. I also started sharing my campus experiences with my family, which has made me feel more connected and supported.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’ve built a supportive network with your family. Connecting with them can offer valuable encouragement. How has sharing your experiences affected your feelings about studying and campus life?

User: It makes me feel more accountable and motivated. When I talk about my challenges and achievements with them, it helps me reflect on my journey and inspires me to keep pushing forward.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiao Qiang. Reflecting on your journey can certainly reinforce your motivation. Could you tell me more about the moments when you felt particularly proud of your accomplishments?

User: One moment that stands out was when I received my grades for the last semester—I did pass more subjects than I expected. It felt like all my hard work was paying off, and I got a surge of confidence.

Consultant: Celebrating those milestones is important! That confidence can be a great foundation for future successes. How do you think you can build on this momentum?

User: I want to keep setting small goals, like studying consistently every day and participating more in class discussions. I believe these will help me stay engaged.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is a smart approach! By staying engaged, you’re likely to maintain that sense of accomplishment. Are there any specific subjects or areas where you’d like to focus your efforts more?

User: Yeah, I still struggle a bit with math. I want to improve there, so I’m considering joining a study group. I think collaborating with classmates could help me understand better.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like a great idea! Collaboration can enhance learning experiences and offer you support. How do you feel about engaging with your classmates in that way?

User: I’m a little nervous, I usually prefer studying alone, but I think it would be beneficial. Plus, it might help me make new friends!

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous about trying something new, but it’s also an excellent opportunity for growth. What steps can you take to ease that anxiety about joining a group?

User: Maybe I could start by reaching out to a couple of classmates I know. I could also express my concerns upfront, so they understand I might need some time to adjust.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful plan! Communicating your feelings can help set a comfort level with your group. As you explore this path, how do you want to ensure that you're also taking care of your well-being?

User: I think I will try to maintain a balance between my study time and relaxation. I enjoy playing video games, so I’ll make sure to include some leisure time to recharge.

Consultant: Balancing study and relaxation is key! Enjoying hobbies and making time for fun can help prevent burnout. How do you feel about your current ability to maintain that balance?

User: I feel like I’m doing well. I’ve been better at time management, so it hasn’t been hard to fit everything in. I want to keep that up.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Xiao Qiang! Maintaining that balance is essential for long-term success. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel has been the most significant takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is the importance of sharing my experiences and maintaining balance. Both help me stay motivated and engaged in my studies.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight! Reflecting on how sharing and balance contribute to your growth can guide you moving forward. As we conclude our time today, what strategies will you implement to sustain this positive state?

User: I’ll continue setting small goals, engaging with my family about my school life, and joining the study group. That should help keep me on the right track.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! I believe you have the tools needed to keep progressing. Remember, you can always reach out for support if needed. Thank you for sharing your journey today, Xiao Qiang. I'm so proud of how far you've come!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I'll keep working on my goals and look forward to our next session.
