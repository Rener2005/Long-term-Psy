Consultant: Hello Huang, it's good to see you again. I want to start by asking how you've been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling even more overwhelmed. The pressure of this two-year rehabilitation is just too much for me. Sometimes I don’t know how to cope with it, and I feel like my situation is hopeless.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and hopelessness regarding your rehabilitation. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming for you right now?

User: I just don’t understand why I keep making these impulsive decisions to hurt myself. It feels like I’m trapped in a cycle I can't escape from. I want to break free, but then I feel lost.

Consultant: Feeling trapped is a very distressing experience, and I appreciate you sharing that with me, Huang. Let’s explore those impulsive feelings a bit more. When you feel that impulse to hurt yourself, what thoughts go through your mind at that moment?

User: I often think that nothing will ever get better. I feel like I deserve this pain because of how my life has turned out. It feels like the only control I have.

Consultant: That’s a very powerful realization. It seems like there's a connection between your feelings of worthlessness and the need for control. Can we look at those thoughts more closely? How do you think these beliefs about yourself and your situation might be influencing your emotional responses?

User: I guess I think that since I failed in life, there’s no way out for me. It's like I’m not allowed to feel good about myself, so I bring on more pain.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those beliefs shape your emotions. However, I wonder if there's a different way to view your situation. Can you imagine what you would say to a friend who felt like they failed and didn’t deserve happiness?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to ask for help. But it feels different when it’s me.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It’s important to realize that it’s okay for you to seek help and to view your experiences through a more forgiving lens. What if we work on challenging that belief that you don’t deserve to feel good? How would that change the way you perceive your situation?

User: It could change a lot, I guess. But I’m not sure how to stop feeling so low about myself.

Consultant: Let’s take small steps together. One approach can be to write down those negative thoughts when they arise. Then, we can collaboratively discuss alternative, more positive thoughts that could counteract them. Would you be open to trying that?

User: I can try that. But what if I don’t know how to think positively? It feels so unnatural to me.

Consultant: That’s very common, Huang. It often feels awkward at first. What we can do is start by identifying at least one small positive aspect of yourself or your situation, no matter how insignificant it may seem. What’s something positive you can identify?

User: I think I’m resilient. I’ve endured a lot and I’m still here, even though it’s hard. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your resilience is a fantastic start. It shows that you have strength within you, even when times are tough. How does recognizing this strength make you feel about your current situation?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful, I suppose. Like maybe I can handle this.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling. It sounds like you’re beginning to see that while things are challenging, there might be a path to handle them differently. As we move forward, let’s plan to explore how your family dynamics, especially with your father, influence these feelings and beliefs.

User: That sounds... complicated. I don’t really understand how he plays into all of this.

Consultant: It can be complicated, but understanding these relationships can aid in understanding how they’ve shaped your self-view and behaviors. Can we delve a bit into your feelings towards him? What thoughts or emotions come up when you think about your father?

User: I feel a lot of anger and disappointment. He was never supportive and just made things worse for me when I was younger.

Consultant: Those feelings are valid, Huang. It’s important to express and acknowledge them. Exploring your relationship with your father might uncover some patterns that could explain your current feelings. How do you think this affected how you see yourself?

User: I guess I’ve always felt like I’m not good enough because of his expectations. Maybe that's why I don't believe in myself now.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. It sounds like there’s a pervasive belief linked to those expectations that you still carry with you. What do you think would happen if you began to separate your self-worth from his expectations?

User: It would be a huge change, I think. It feels scary to think about, but also kind of freeing.

Consultant: Recognizing the potential for freedom in that change is essential. It does take time and practice, but learning to value yourself outside of external expectations is a valuable skill. How about we focus on building that perspective in our next sessions?

User: I would like that, yes. I want to work on seeing myself differently.

Consultant: That's a solid goal, Huang. As we wrap up today's session, I’d like you to spend some time this week reflecting on those positive aspects of yourself we talked about. Remember, it’s a process, and every small step matters.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely try to focus on the positives.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I’m proud of you for engaging in this process, and I look forward to seeing you next time to continue working on these insights together. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang. It’s great to see you again. I know we started exploring some of your feelings regarding your family dynamics in our last session. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling very conflicted. I often think about my father and how his treatment of me has shaped who I am today. Sometimes, I feel angry, and other times, I just feel lost.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Huang. It's understandable to have mixed emotions when reflecting on such significant figures in your life. What do you think has been the most challenging aspect of this reflection for you?

User: I guess I feel like I want to understand why he treated me that way. I often feel like I've been pushed aside, and it's hard to shake off that feeling of isolation.

Consultant: That feeling of isolation must be really difficult to cope with. It’s important to acknowledge how past experiences contribute to the way we see ourselves. When you think about those moments of feeling pushed aside, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think I'm just not good enough or that I deserve to be alone. It’s like there’s this voice in my head that says I won’t ever change.

Consultant: That sounds like a very heavy burden to bear. Those thoughts can be really overpowering. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started feeling that way about yourself?

User: It started when I was a teenager. My father would often criticize me, and no matter how hard I tried, it felt like nothing was ever good enough. It led to me just giving up on trying to please him.

Consultant: It's understandable that such criticism would lead you to feel that way. It's important to recognize that those experiences can shape our self-image. Looking back, can you see any moments where you felt proud of yourself, despite those challenges?

User: There were a few times, like when I managed to get good grades in school projects, but those moments were overshadowed by the criticism. It feels like I never fully allowed myself to celebrate those successes.

Consultant: Acknowledging those moments of success is crucial. They show that you’re capable of achieving good things. What do you think it would take for you to start recognizing and celebrating your successes more?

User: I think I need to stop comparing myself to others and focus on my own journey. But it's hard to break that habit.

Consultant: It really can be hard to shift our focus. We often hold onto habits that feel familiar, even if they are unhelpful. What do you think might help you to focus more on yourself rather than on comparisons?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself? Something that I can achieve and feel proud of.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Setting small, achievable goals can help build your confidence over time. What might be a small goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: Perhaps I could try reaching out to someone I haven’t spoken to in a while. Just to start a conversation.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Starting a conversation can definitely be a step towards building connections. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel nervous but also a bit excited. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, Huang. Remember, taking that step is a testament to your willingness to engage with others. What thoughts might come up for you as you prepare to reach out?

User: I worry they might not want to talk to me, or that I’ll mess up and not know what to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts are understandable. Sometimes we anticipate negative outcomes, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what will happen. What might be a helpful way to challenge those worries?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I have value in conversations, and that it's okay if it's not perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your value is a powerful strategy. Fostering that positive self-talk can help combat those worries. How about we discuss some ways you could encourage this positive self-talk in your daily life?

User: That would help! Maybe I could keep a journal of positive affirmations about myself.

Consultant: A journaling practice focused on positive affirmations is a fantastic idea! It allows you to regularly reinforce your self-worth. How do you feel about starting this practice?

User: I think it's a good plan. It could help me keep a positive perspective.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Consistent practice can build a stronger sense of self. What else do you think you could do in conjunction with journaling to further enhance your confidence?

User: I could also reach out and reconnect with more people. Maybe even join a group that interests me.

Consultant: Joining a group sounds like a wonderful way to meet new people and develop your social skills! It can also provide a supportive environment. What type of group interests you?

User: I’m thinking about joining a local gaming community or art class. Something fun.

Consultant: Those both sound like excellent options! Engaging in activities you enjoy can make connecting with others feel more natural and enjoyable. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds exciting! I just hope I can overcome the initial fear of joining.

Consultant: It's natural to feel apprehensive about new experiences. Would you like to brainstorm some ways to ease that initial anxiety when you decide to join?

User: I could practice some relaxation techniques beforehand. Maybe deep breathing.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! It's simple but very effective in managing anxiety. Have you practiced deep breathing before?

User: Not much, but I’ve read about it. I think I can manage to give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a good plan! Practicing it ahead of time can help you feel more prepared and calm when you enter those new situations. As we wrap up today, what would you say your main takeaway from this session is?

User: I feel like I have a better understanding of my feelings, and I’m more hopeful about taking steps to connect with others. It feels manageable now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You've made great progress today, Huang. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. I’m here to support you anytime you need. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my family situation, and it's really tough for me to interact with others. I tried talking to some members of the rehabilitation center, but I still feel awkward and frustrated afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions when it comes to social interactions. Frustration can be difficult to navigate. Can you tell me what specific thoughts were going through your mind during those interactions?

User: I kept thinking that they probably wouldn’t understand me or that I would just embarrass myself. It made me feel anxious and want to retreat.

Consultant: That makes sense. Those anxious thoughts can definitely create a barrier to connection. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. How do you think they might be impacting your feelings during social interactions?

User: I think they make me feel more isolated. If I believe that nobody will relate to me, I’m less likely to engage.

Consultant: You're recognizing a link between your thoughts and feelings, which is an important step. Would you say these thoughts are mostly extreme or perhaps unrealistic?

User: Yes, I do tend to think it's all or nothing. Either they will understand me completely or they won’t at all.

Consultant: That's a common cognitive distortion called black-and-white thinking. What if we looked for some middle ground? Are there moments where you felt some understanding or connection, even if it was small?

User: I guess there were a few times when someone smiled or shared their own struggles, and it felt nice. But then I quickly dismissed it as a fluke.

Consultant: It's great to hear you experienced those moments! It shows that some connection is possible. How might you challenge the idea that those experiences were just a fluke?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that people can understand each other to different degrees, and it doesn’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: That's a positive shift in perspective! Would you be willing to try engaging with others again, while keeping that new thought in mind?

User: I think I could try. But what if I feel overwhelmed again like before?

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about feeling overwhelmed. What if we create a plan where you start with very small interactions, like saying hello or asking someone how their day was? 

User: That sounds manageable. I’d feel a little less pressure that way.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it's okay to have these feelings. You don’t have to push yourself too hard right away. What small step would you like to take this week?

User: I could try to say hi to someone at the center. It feels like a good starting point.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! After you do it, let’s discuss how it felt in our next session. We can build from there. 

User: Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind. I worry a bit about feeling discouraged if it goes poorly.

Consultant: That makes sense, but let’s also think about how to deal with that. What if you identified a coping strategy, like deep breathing, to practice if you begin to feel discouraged?

User: I could try that. It might help to calm me down in those moments.

Consultant: Great! Breathing can be very grounding. It’s also helpful to reflect afterward on what you learned from the experience, regardless of the outcome. How does that sound?

User: That sounds reasonable. I like the idea of learning from it instead of just seeing it as a success or failure.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! I believe you’re on the right track. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful actually. It’s nice to think about taking small steps.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. Remember, progress can be gradual. You have a lot of strengths to draw upon. Let’s continue building on that. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. It makes me feel like I can actually improve.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Huang! I’m here to support you. Keep practicing, and let's discuss your experiences next time. 

User: I will. See you next time, then! 

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! It's great to see you again. I’d like to start our session by discussing your recent experiences. How have you been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling encouraged because I managed to participate in some social activities recently. For the first time, I actually enjoyed being around others, but I still worry about falling back into my old patterns during longer interactions.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’re having positive experiences! It’s completely normal to have some concerns, especially when trying something new. Could you share more about these successful social interactions? What specifically went well for you?

User: Well, during one gathering, I started a conversation with someone, and it felt really good, like I was actually connecting. We talked about our favorite games, and I found myself laughing. It was nice to share something without feeling anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you experienced a genuine connection, which is fantastic! Laughter can be incredibly uplifting. What do you think made that interaction feel so positive for you, and how can we build on that?

User: I suppose it was because I felt comfortable discussing something I love. I realized that when I focus on common interests, I can relax a bit more. However, I’m still worried about what happens when socializing goes on for too long.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d feel that way. Focusing on shared interests can indeed help ease anxiety. Let’s explore strategies to manage longer social situations. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about being in a social setting for an extended period?

User: I often think that I might run out of things to say or feel overwhelmed by the pressure to keep the conversation going. I fear that I’ll revert to awkward silence or just want to leave.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common and understandable. Let’s challenge that a bit. What evidence do you have that these situations will turn out poorly? Have you experienced anything that contradicts those thoughts during your recent experiences?

User: Actually, thinking back to the gathering, I did manage to maintain the conversation for a while, and it felt okay. I guess I often jump to the worst-case scenario without considering that I can handle it.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It shows you have the ability to engage and enjoy social interactions. Let’s work on building that awareness further. How about we set some small goals for your next social event? Perhaps a strategy to pause and take a breath if you start to feel overwhelmed?

User: That sounds helpful. I think if I remind myself to take breaks, it might ease the pressure. I’m just not sure how to go about doing that.

Consultant: A simple approach could be to give yourself permission to step aside for a moment if needed. You might say, “I just need a quick break.” It’s okay to take care of your feelings during social situations. How would that feel for you?

User: That might actually work! I can see how taking a break would relieve some pressure. I also think it would help me reset before re-engaging.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re recognizing how to manage your needs, which is crucial. One more thing we could implement is having a few conversation starters ready. This way, if you feel stuck, you can refer back to them. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I love the idea of having starters prepared. It feels like a safety net I can rely on. 

Consultant: I’m glad you like it! Let’s brainstorm a few starters together. What topics or questions would you feel comfortable discussing?

User: Maybe I can ask about their favorite movies or recent activities, or even share something funny that happened to me. It’s something relatable.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! They invite conversation and keep it light. Remember, it’s perfectly fine to lean on these starters if you feel unsure. Now, reflecting on the progress you’ve made, how do you feel about your ability to handle social interactions moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more confident. Knowing that I can take breaks and have conversation starters gives me hope. It feels like I’m taking steps forward instead of running back to old habits.

Consultant: That’s an important shift in your mindset! Building confidence takes time, and recognizing these small victories is key. What strategies do you think you can use to continue reinforcing this confidence after our session today?

User: I can practice using conversation starters in smaller settings first, and remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had. Keeping a journal might help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Writing down your thoughts can help solidify your progress. Let’s ensure that you continue celebrating these moments. How do you feel about reconnecting with friends or even reaching out to new people using these strategies?

User: I think it would be a good idea! I’m a bit nervous, but I feel like I can give it a try, especially if I remember all the positive things we talked about.

Consultant: Embracing that nervousness is a sign of growth! You’re already moving in the right direction by planning to apply what we discussed. How do you feel about scheduling our next session to reflect on your experiences?

User: I think that would be good. I want to share how it goes and get more feedback. I’m feeling hopeful!

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experiences! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. You’re on the right track, Huang. Let’s wrap up our session today—do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: Just that I feel more assured now. Thank you for helping me see things differently today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Keep embracing those positive experiences, and I’ll see you next time to celebrate your progress. Stay strong!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling after your recent group activity where you received positive feedback?

User: Hi. Honestly, I felt really good after that activity. It was nice to hear those encouraging words from my teammates. For the first time in a while, I felt like I contributed something.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience was a significant boost to your confidence. Can you tell me more about how that made you feel and what thoughts came to your mind afterward?

User: After the activity, I felt a mix of pride and uncertainty. I keep questioning whether I can keep this up. I enjoyed the moment, but I wonder if I’ll disappoint them next time.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both pride and uncertainty. It's a sign that you're reflecting on your experiences. Let's explore that uncertainty. What specific thoughts come up for you when you think about potentially disappointing them?

User: I often think that if I don’t perform well, they might not appreciate me as much. I worry that I’ll go back to being the person no one notices.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of pressure from the fear of judgment. How do these thoughts of disappointment affect your feelings about engaging in future activities?

User: They make me hesitate. Sometimes I want to participate, but then I hold back, thinking I might not be good enough, which makes me feel anxious.

Consultant: That anxiety can be quite paralyzing, can’t it? Let’s try to challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that you’ll disappoint them in the future? Have you seen any signs that they value your contributions?

User: Well, they did appreciate my input last time. I guess there's no real reason to believe I’d disappoint them... It just feels so intense in the moment.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize that your last experience was positive. Remembering those instances where you were appreciated can help counteract this intense fear. What if we reframed that thought? How might it sound if you consider that your effort is valued regardless of the outcome?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that as long as I try my best, I deserve to feel good about myself, even if things don’t always go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a great reframe! Emphasizing your effort over the outcome can foster a healthier mindset. How do you think adopting this perspective might change your approach to future group activities?

User: I think it would ease some of the pressure I feel. If I focus on my contribution rather than on what others think, I might feel freer to engage.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your own contributions can lighten the load of others' evaluations. Let's build on this mindset. What are some small steps you could take in your next group interaction to practice this approach?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to share at least one idea during the next meeting, without worrying too much about how it’s received.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By setting that goal, you’re taking control of your experience. What emotions do you think will come up for you as you try this?

User: I think I’ll feel a bit nervous but also excited. I really want to see how it goes.

Consultant: Nervousness can be a natural response, but excitement is a positive sign. How can you prepare yourself to handle those nerves when they arise?

User: I could remind myself that feeling nervous just means I care about the outcome. And I could practice some breathing exercises to stay calm before speaking.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! By acknowledging your nerves and using relaxation techniques, you’ll be better equipped to express yourself. How does it feel knowing you have a plan in place for your next interaction?

User: It feels relieving to have a plan. I feel more in control, and it’s nice to see that I can also lean on my own thoughts instead of just worrying about others.

Consultant: Absolutely! This self-reliance is a significant step toward building your confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve achieved and how you can maintain this progress. What’s your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I’ve learned that I can trust my own input and focus on my contributions instead of worrying too much about others’ opinions. It makes me feel more empowered.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Huang! As you move forward, remember that your perspective matters and that you've got the skills to validate your contributions. How will you continue to reinforce this mindset in the future?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that I deserve to feel good about my efforts, and I’ll challenge any negative thoughts that come up. I guess I need to keep practicing it.

Consultant: Perfect! Practice is key, and I'm confident you’ll make progress. If you find yourself struggling, just remember our discussion. I'm here to support you whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the guidance. I’m looking forward to applying what we discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to hearing about your thoughts since our last session. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident, especially after participating in group activities. However, there’s still a nagging worry about returning to normal life after rehab. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that your confidence has improved and that you’re engaging more with others. Let’s explore that worry about returning to normal life. What specifically are you concerned about?

User: I guess I’m worried that I might slip back into my old habits. I want to keep moving forward, but what if I can’t handle the pressures outside?

Consultant: Those concerns are completely valid. Transitioning back into everyday life can be challenging. You’ve made incredible progress; what strengths do you think you can draw upon to help you in this transition?

User: I think my social skills have really improved, and I can better manage my emotions now. I just hope it’s enough when I face real-life situations.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid foundation with those improved social skills and emotional management. Let’s focus on how you can apply these strengths. What strategies can you think of that might help you cope with those pressures when they arise?

User: I guess I could start by making a plan for my day-to-day life. If I could structure my time and have support from my sister, that could help me stay on track.

Consultant: A structured plan sounds like a great way to navigate daily life! How do you envision that plan working? What elements do you think are crucial to include?

User: I think I should set aside time for work, leisure, and socializing. Also, maybe check in regularly with my sister for support.

Consultant: That’s a well-rounded approach! Balancing work, leisure, and socializing will be essential for your well-being. What do you think would be a realistic way to start implementing this plan?

User: I could create a daily schedule and start with small, achievable goals each day. That way, I won’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Starting small can help build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to set some specific short-term goals for your first week after rehab?

User: Sure! I think I’ll aim to spend at least an hour on job hunting each day and also dedicate time to engage with friends or family.

Consultant: Those sound like very achievable goals! Focusing on job hunting while maintaining social connections is a wonderful balance. How do you think you’ll feel if you accomplish these goals?

User: I think it would boost my confidence even more. Even if I only manage a little each day, it would feel like I’m moving forward.

Consultant: Absolutely! Every little step counts. Additionally, what potential obstacles can you foresee that might challenge your plan, and how could you address them?

User: I guess distractions from gaming or gambling tendencies could be a challenge. I might need to set specific boundaries for myself regarding screen time.

Consultant: Recognizing those potential distractions is an important step. Setting boundaries is key to avoiding old habits. What kind of boundaries are you thinking of putting in place?

User: Maybe I can limit gaming to a couple of hours a week after I've completed my daily goals. That way, it won’t interfere with my plans.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! You’re taking control of your time and prioritizing your goals. How do you plan to keep reminding yourself of your objectives when distractions arise?

User: I could write my goals on a sticky note and keep it on my desk to remind me of what I want to achieve.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visual reminders can be very effective. How do you feel about having these strategies in place to help guide you through this transition?

User: I feel a lot better knowing I have a plan. It gives me a sense of security, and I think I’m ready to face these changes.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more secure about the upcoming changes! As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our discussion that will help you moving forward?

User: I feel renewed motivation and a clearer plan for my transition. It’s reassuring to know I have specific goals and strategies in place.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made tremendous progress, and I believe you’re ready for this next chapter. Remember, it’s perfectly fine to seek support when needed. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we conclude?

User: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate your guidance today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support. Good luck, Huang, and I’m confident you’ll do wonderfully!
