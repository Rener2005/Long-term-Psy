Consultant: Hello, Yun Yun! I'm really glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious and lonely, especially after my mid-term exam results were disappointing. My mom and I had a big fight about it, and I just feel so isolated at home.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like it's been tough for you. Could you share a bit more about the fight with your mom and how that made you feel?

User: Well, she was really upset about my grades, and I just felt like she didn't care about how much I was struggling. I can't focus on my studies, and all she sees is the result. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It must be incredibly frustrating to feel misunderstood, especially when you're doing your best. In those moments, what sort of thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I often think that I'm disappointing everyone, and sometimes I wonder if it would be better if I wasn’t here. It’s really hard to shake off that feeling.

Consultant: Yun Yun, I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It sounds like the pressure from school and at home is weighing heavily on you. Can we dig a little deeper into those thoughts you mentioned? What do you think makes you feel that being gone would be better?

User: I don’t know... maybe because it feels like I can’t make anyone happy. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of disappointment.

Consultant: That cycle sounds really exhausting. When those thoughts come up, do you ever notice any signs of how they affect your emotions or actions?

User: Yes, when I think that way, I just want to shut everything out. I avoid talking to my family or doing my homework. It's like I feel paralyzed.

Consultant: I see. Avoidance can feel like a relief in the moment, but it often makes things tougher in the long run. What do you think would help break that cycle for you, even just a little bit?

User: I guess if I could talk to my mom without it turning into a fight, maybe I could feel a little better. But I don’t know how.

Consultant: That’s a really good insight! Communication can be challenging, especially when emotions are high. What would you want to say to her if you had the chance?

User: I would want to tell her that I’m trying and that I’m scared of disappointing her. I need her to understand me, but I don’t know how to start.

Consultant: It sounds like expressing your fears and vulnerability could be a great start. Sometimes using "I" statements can help, like "I feel scared when I think about my grades" instead of blaming her. What do you think of that approach?

User: I think that might help. I just hope she listens and doesn’t get angry again.

Consultant: That's understandable. It’s a big step to express your feelings honestly. Maybe you could even ask her if this is a good time to talk about it when things are calm. How would that make you feel?

User: It would feel a bit less intimidating to at least try that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take this one step at a time. You’re being brave by even considering having that conversation. What else do you think could help you cope with your feelings of loneliness right now?

User: I think I could reach out to a friend, but I’m not sure they’d understand what I'm going through.

Consultant: Reaching out to a friend sounds like a great idea. Sometimes friends can provide support we didn’t expect. You could share a little bit about how you’re feeling, and if they have their own struggles, it might bring you closer together. What do you think?

User: That makes sense. I might try that. I really just want someone to listen without judging.

Consultant: Absolutely! Genuine support can make a big difference. Let’s also think about some small things you can do for yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed. What activities or hobbies bring you even a little bit of joy?

User: I like drawing, but I haven’t felt inspired to do it lately.

Consultant: Drawing can be such a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings. Maybe setting aside just a few minutes a day to draw could help channel some of that anxiety into creativity. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds nice. I think I could do that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Just remember, it's important to be kind to yourself in this process. Life can be tough, especially at your age. Is there anything else that feels important for us to discuss today?

User: I just want to figure out how to deal with my mom better. I feel like that’s the main source of my anxiety.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. The relationship with your mom is really important to you. With practice, using open communication can help you express your thoughts and feelings without fear of conflict. Would you like us to brainstorm a few scenarios together?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Let’s imagine a situation where you want to talk to her about your grades. What could you say at the beginning of the conversation to set a calm tone?

User: Maybe I could start by saying I really appreciate everything she does for our family and that I just want to share what I'm feeling.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to open! Showing appreciation often goes a long way. Then perhaps you could follow up with your feelings about your grades. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I think it sounds gentle, which might help keep things from escalating.

Consultant: Exactly! Starting on a positive note can create a safe space for conversation. As you practice this, remember to take care of yourself emotionally. Reflecting on how you feel after every conversation can also help you understand your progress. 

User: I will try and remember that. Thank you for helping me think this through.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yun Yun. You’re making great strides in addressing your feelings and seeking ways to improve your situation. Keep reminding yourself that it’s a process. Whenever you feel alone, know that you can return to these strategies or talk to someone who understands.

User: I appreciate that a lot. I’ll keep trying, even when it feels tough.

Consultant: I believe in you, and I know you have the strength to navigate through this. Let’s keep building on this together in our next session. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! Looking forward to talking again.

Consultant: Hello, Yun Yun! I'm really glad to see you today. Let’s start by discussing how you’ve been feeling lately, especially about your relationship with your mother. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I feel really frustrated with my mother. We keep arguing, especially when I stay up late to study. It seems she doesn't understand how much pressure I feel to do well in school.

Consultant: That sounds very tough. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with the expectations at school. Can you share more about those arguments? What do they usually involve?

User: Most of the time, she complains that I spend too much time studying and not getting enough rest. I feel like she doesn't see how hard I'm trying or the stress I'm under. It makes me feel alone.

Consultant: It’s clear that you desire her understanding and support. You want to be recognized for your efforts. What do you think would help improve your communication with her during these moments?

User: I guess I could try to explain my feelings to her more openly. But I worry she won't listen, or she'll just get angry.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it shows you’re thinking about how she might react. What if we practiced how you might express your feelings to her? This could help you feel more confident.

User: Okay, that might be helpful. I think I would want to start by saying that I really do try hard in school and that staying up late is stressful for me.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You could also express how you feel when she gets upset about it. How about saying, “Mom, I feel alone when you don’t see my efforts”? 

User: That sounds good. I never thought of saying it like that. I usually just get defensive instead.

Consultant: It’s normal to become defensive when we feel hurt. This approach focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. How do you think your mother might respond if you share it this way?

User: I think she might be surprised and maybe a little more understanding. I just hope she doesn’t dismiss my feelings again.

Consultant: That’s a valid hope, and it’s also important to prepare for different reactions. If she doesn’t respond as you want right away, how might you handle that?

User: I guess I could remind her that it’s hard for me feeling like she doesn’t understand. Maybe she’ll think about it later.

Consultant: That’s a wise strategy. Giving her time to reflect can be useful. How do you feel about practicing this kind of conversation with her in upcoming weeks?

User: I think it could help me feel more prepared. I just don’t want to argue every time we talk about it.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Keeping the lines of communication open is essential, but it may take time. Are there specific times you find it easier to talk with her?

User: Maybe after dinner when things are calmer. It's just that she often seems tired, too.

Consultant: That’s a good observation. It might help to choose moments when everyone is more relaxed. Would you feel comfortable initiating a conversation then?

User: I’ll try it. I want to get through to her and show her how much I care too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective, aiming to show your care! As you prepare for these conversations, how do you feel about writing down your thoughts first? It might help organize what you want to say.

User: Writing it down sounds helpful. I do that sometimes when I need to express my thoughts better.

Consultant: Excellent! Writing can clarify your feelings and act as a reminder during the conversation. How will you keep track of these discussions we’ve had today?

User: I can make a note on my phone or write it in my diary. I’ll list what I want to say and things I want to ask her.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’ve shown a lot of insight today. Now, how do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed for improving your communication with your mother?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I really want her to understand and support me.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay if things don’t change overnight. How does thinking about your school experience make you feel during this process?

User: I feel stressed about school too, like I’m not fitting in well and it’s making me even lonelier.

Consultant: That’s a significant concern. The pressure at school can amplify feelings of loneliness. Would you like to explore ways to help improve your connections with classmates?

User: Yes, I really want to feel more connected, but I don’t know how to start.

Consultant: A good way to start could be reaching out to classmates for group study sessions or joining clubs. Have you thought about any activities that interest you?

User: I like drawing, but I’m not sure if there’s a club for that. I could check.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Even if there isn’t a drawing club, you might find friends who share similar interests in art or other activities. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds nice! I’ll look into it. I just want to feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, and taking these small steps can lead to positive changes. Remember, building relationships takes time, so be patient with yourself as you explore new connections.

User: Thanks. I really appreciate the suggestions. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yun Yun. It takes courage to share your feelings and seek support. Keep practicing your communication skills, and I believe you can strengthen your relationships both at home and school. If you need to talk again, I’ll always be here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better about everything. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Take care, and remember to look after yourself. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yun Yun! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately, especially with everything happening at school?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lonely at school. A lot of my classmates have left, and it’s hard to connect with the ones who are still there. I just want to have friends and not feel so alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of sadness and isolation with your classmates leaving. Establishing friendships is important, especially at your age. Can you tell me a bit more about your experiences at school recently?

User: Well, since everyone is leaving, I find myself sitting alone during lunch most days. I just don't know how to approach others or even start a conversation. It feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That must be really tough for you, feeling left out and unsure of how to connect with others. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed in this situation. Have you had moments where you tried to talk to someone new?

User: I tried once to say hi to a girl in my class, but she seemed busy, and I just froze. I felt embarrassed afterward for even trying.

Consultant: It's brave of you to reach out despite feeling nervous. It’s natural to feel embarrassed when things don't go as planned. What thoughts were running through your mind after that attempt?

User: I thought maybe I'd never make any friends because I can't even say hello properly. It just makes me feel more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has led to some negative thoughts about your ability to make friends. These thoughts can create a cycle of feeling lonely and disconnected. Can I ask, what would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way you are right now?

User: I would tell them it's okay to feel nervous and that they should keep trying, even if it's hard. 

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. It shows you understand that feeling nervous is part of the process. Now, what do you think about applying that same kindness toward yourself? 

User: I guess I should. I just feel like I keep failing when I try to connect with others.

Consultant: It's really important to give yourself some grace. Everyone experiences struggles in social situations, and it doesn't define your worth. If you were to try and talk to someone again, what small step might you take that feels manageable for you? 

User: Maybe I could start with a smile or just say hi again, even if it doesn't lead to a conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step! A smile or simple greeting can be a good way to break the ice. How do you feel about trying that in your next interaction at school?

User: I think I can try that. It feels less intimidating than jumping into a full conversation right away.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Yun Yun. Taking small steps can be much more manageable. How do you think you might feel after trying that out?

User: I think I would feel a little more confident if I just say hi. But I’m still worried about how people will respond.

Consultant: Worrying about others' responses is common. One thing to remember is that you cannot control how they react, but you can control your approach. If someone doesn't respond positively, it doesn’t reflect your value as a friend. Would you be open to exploring some positive affirmations to help shift your mindset?

User: Positive affirmations? I’ve heard of them, but I’m not sure how they work.

Consultant: Affirmations are positive statements that can help challenge negative thoughts. For instance, saying "I am worthy of friendship" can remind you of your value. Would you like to come up with a few affirmations together?

User: Sure, that sounds interesting. 

Consultant: Great! How about starting with one that resonates with how you want to feel in social situations? What’s a positive thought that you believe could help you?

User: Maybe “I can make friends, and it’s okay to take my time.”

Consultant: I love that affirmation! It's realistic and supportive, encouraging yourself to take your time. How will you remind yourself of this affirmation during your school days?

User: I could write it down and maybe read it before school or even keep it in my phone.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having it accessible will help reinforce that positive thought. How do you feel about the progress you've made today in understanding your feelings and finding ways to connect with others?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, actually. I think I have some strategies to try now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Yun Yun! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. As we continue our sessions, we will keep working on building your confidence and connection skills. What do you think would be a good focus for our next session?

User: Maybe I can share how my interactions go and we can talk about more strategies if I need them.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, practicing these skills takes time, and I’m here to support you. You're making important steps forward. 

User: Thank you! I feel better talking about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you found this helpful. Take care, Yun Yun, and I look forward to our next session together!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yun Yun! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling, especially with your recent attempts to join the school club?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I joined the club to make friends and feel more connected, but it’s really hard for me to fit in. I often feel out of place and question if I belong there.

Consultant: I understand it can be daunting to enter a new group, especially when you're eager to belong. Can you tell me more about what specific experiences in the club have made you feel this way?

User: Well, every time I try to start a conversation with someone, I feel nervous. They seem to have their own close friends, and I feel like an outsider looking in. It’s frustrating because I want to connect, but I just freeze up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing some anxiety when trying to engage with others. That’s completely normal. What thoughts run through your mind during those moments when you feel frozen?

User: I think things like “They won’t want to talk to me” or “I’ll embarrass myself.” It just discourages me from trying.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be tough to challenge. Let’s explore them a bit. How true do you think those thoughts are? Do you have any evidence that supports or contradicts them?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. I mean, nobody has actually told me to leave. But it feels so real in the moment.

Consultant: It's great that you’re recognizing that! Sometimes feelings can be misleading. If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them to think about their situation?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone feels nervous in new situations and to just be themselves. Maybe not to overthink it.

Consultant: That’s a kind approach! Now, how can we apply that idea to your experience? What if you allowed yourself to be a bit more open during these interactions?

User: Maybe I could just introduce myself and smile, even if it feels awkward. It could help me take that first step.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking small steps like that can lead to meaningful connections. What activities or topics do you think might help you ease into conversations with others in the club?

User: I like art, and I noticed some members working on projects. I could ask them about what they're creating. That might give me something to talk about.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Focusing on shared interests can be a great way to connect. How do you feel about this approach? Does it ease some of your anxiety?

User: Yes, it does feel a bit less intimidating. Talking about art is something I enjoy!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s plan to use that as a strategy. Additionally, what are some strengths or qualities you possess that you can remind yourself of when you feel anxious?

User: I’m creative and I guess I have a good sense of humor. Sometimes I can make people laugh!

Consultant: Those are great qualities! Reminding yourself of these positive traits can help bolster your confidence. How do you think embracing these aspects of yourself might change your experience in the club?

User: I think if I focus on my strengths, I won’t be so consumed by fear of rejection. I could actually enjoy myself more and interact with others naturally.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing your strengths can shift your perspective. How can you practice this approach in your next club meeting?

User: I could set a goal to say at least one thing about an art topic and maybe try to crack a joke. Just little things to start.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. Remember, it’s about small, consistent steps. How do you feel about trying this out at the next meeting?

User: I feel optimistic about it! I think I can do it if I remind myself to be positive.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! In addition to this, let’s discuss what you can do if things don’t go as planned. How might you cope with any setbacks?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and everyone has their off days. And I can always try again next time.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Recognizing that it’s okay to have ups and downs will help you stay resilient. What progress do you feel you’ve made so far in this process?

User: I feel like I’ve learned to identify my fears and turn them into goals. I also have a clearer idea of how to interact with others.

Consultant: That’s an impressive realization! As we wrap up today, what would you like to focus on moving forward to ensure you're building on this progress?

User: I want to keep practicing interacting in the club and building my confidence. I hope I can come back next time and share my experiences!

Consultant: I’d love to hear about your experiences! It’s been a pleasure working with you today, Yun Yun. Remember, you're making meaningful progress. If you feel uncertain, just reach out to your strengths. I'll see you next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello Yun Yun! I’m really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been making some positive strides in your social interactions. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I feel a bit more confident since I’ve made some friends in my school club. It’s nice to have their support, but I still worry about my social skills and whether I can maintain these friendships.

Consultant: That’s a great start, and it's perfectly normal to feel both excitement and worry. Let’s explore that feeling of confidence a bit more. What specific aspects of your social skills do you think you might want to improve or focus on?

User: I think I struggle with starting and maintaining conversations. Sometimes I feel like I don’t know what to say, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious about conversations, especially when trying to connect with others. Can you share a recent experience where you felt that anxiety during a chat with someone?

User: Well, just last week, I was talking to a friend about our favorite movies, but I blanked out and didn’t know how to keep the conversation going. I just nodded a lot, and it felt awkward.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, and it's great that you're identifying those moments. Nodding can be a way to show you're listening, but it’s also important to feel comfortable adding to the conversation. What kind of thoughts did you have during that interaction? 

User: I kept thinking, "What if they think I'm boring?" or "I shouldn’t have said that." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh. It’s common for people to have negative self-talk like that. Let’s try to reframe these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they found you boring or that you shouldn’t have spoken up?

User: I guess I don’t really have any real evidence. They seemed engaged, but I just assumed the worst.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Often our mind jumps to conclusions without sufficient proof. If a friend expressed similar feelings about their conversation, how would you reassure them?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay and that everyone has moments like that. Conversations don’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective towards others, which is a great quality. Let’s try to apply that same understanding to yourself. Next time, could you remind yourself that it’s okay to have imperfect moments in a conversation?

User: Yes, that makes sense. I'll try to be kinder to myself instead of expecting perfection.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Now, let’s discuss some practical strategies to help you feel more comfortable in conversations. Are there any topics you enjoy that could serve as conversation starters with your friends?

User: I really like music, and I know a lot about it. Maybe I could bring that up more often.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Music can be a lively topic and usually leads to great discussions. How about planning to ask your friends about their favorite songs or concerts next time?

User: I’ll definitely try that! I think it would help me feel more relaxed and engaged.

Consultant: Perfect! Engaging with a topic you’re passionate about can boost your confidence. How about also practicing some conversation prompts or questions to make it easier for you?

User: That sounds useful! I can write down some questions to have on hand.

Consultant: Great! Writing prompts down can help you feel prepared. Also, how do you feel about setting small social goals, like initiating a conversation at least once every week?

User: That sounds doable! I think it would give me more chances to practice.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small goals can help you build momentum and confidence over time. How do you feel about your progress in our sessions so far?

User: I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and think I’m making progress in feeling more confident.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Yun Yun! It’s essential to acknowledge your progress. As we continue, let’s talk about ways to maintain this positive mindset and what you can do if you start feeling anxious again.

User: I’d like that. Sometimes I worry that I’ll revert to how I was before.

Consultant: It’s possible to face setbacks, but having a plan can help you navigate those moments. What strategies or affirmations could you use to remind yourself of the progress you've made?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve made new friends and that I’m capable of improving my social skills.

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Remembering past successes can serve as motivation. Would it be helpful for you to keep a journal of your experiences and feelings during this process?

User: Yes, I think a journal would be great! I can track my conversations and how I felt.

Consultant: Wonderful! Reflecting on your experiences can give you insight and help reinforce your self-management skills. As we wrap up today, what do you think are the key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I think being kinder to myself and practicing more will help me stay confident in social situations.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights, Yun Yun. You’re developing effective strategies to manage your thoughts and interactions. I believe you’re on a positive path. How do you feel about scheduling our next session to continue building on this progress?

User: I’d love to! I’m excited to keep working on my social skills.

Consultant: Fantastic! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you have the skills to navigate these situations, and you’re not alone in this journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello Yun Yun! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. I think my ability to manage myself has improved, and my family relationships have gotten better too.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing positive changes. Can you share a bit more about what specific improvements you've noticed?

User: Well, I find it easier to communicate with my parents now. We talk more, and they seem more supportive. I also feel less overwhelmed with my schoolwork.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling more supported at home and that communication has improved. That can really help with managing stress. Let's take a moment to review the effective strategies you've developed so far. Can you recall what techniques have worked best for you?

User: I think writing in my journal has helped a lot. It allows me to express my feelings and reflect on my day. Also, taking breaks when studying helps me stay focused.

Consultant: Journaling and taking breaks are excellent strategies! They show you're actively engaging in your self-care. How do you feel when you practice those strategies?

User: I feel relieved and less stressed after journaling. And when I take breaks, I can concentrate better when I return to my studies.

Consultant: That's a positive response. It's important to recognize how these practices benefit you. Have you thought about setting any new goals for yourself, moving forward?

User: I’d like to aim for better grades this term but also want to maintain my mental well-being. I don’t want to feel too pressured again.

Consultant: It's wise of you to prioritize both your academic goals and your mental well-being. What steps do you think you can take to achieve those goals?

User: I could create a study schedule and make sure to include some relaxation time in it. That way, I won't overstress myself.

Consultant: A study schedule sounds like a great idea! It will help you manage your time effectively. How do you plan to ensure you stick to this schedule?

User: Maybe I can set reminders on my phone or ask my parents to check in on me to keep me accountable.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Having reminders and support from your parents can be very helpful. Are there any specific areas or subjects you feel you need additional support with?

User: I struggle mostly with math. Sometimes I just don’t understand the concepts, and it feels discouraging.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to find certain subjects challenging. Have you considered seeking help from a teacher or a tutor to work through those math concepts together?

User: I haven’t thought about it much, but that could really help. I might feel less lost if I get some extra guidance.

Consultant: Connecting with a teacher or tutor could really clarify things for you and alleviate some of that frustration. What do you think your next step will be in addressing these math challenges?

User: I think I will talk to my math teacher and see if I can get some extra help after school.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive plan! It shows that you're willing to take charge of your learning. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel like I have a clearer path now with my study schedule and knowing I can ask for help with math. It's reassuring.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Yun Yun! You've made significant progress, and it’s fantastic that you’re feeling reassured. Remember, it's all about balance, and you have the tools to manage your studies and well-being. If you ever need more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I wish you all the best with your goals. Take care, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.
