Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite lonely and anxious. The situation in the dormitory with my classmates hasn’t improved, and it really bothers me, especially with all the work I need to do.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like the isolation is weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing with your classmates?

User: Well, I feel like they completely ignore me. Even when I try to say hello or make small talk, they just don't respond. It makes me feel really rejected and lowers my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds really hurtful, and it's understandable to feel rejected in such a situation. How does this feeling affect your day-to-day life and your studies?

User: It makes it hard for me to focus on my studies. I feel so stressed about my upcoming projects, and the loneliness just makes it worse. Sometimes, I think maybe it's better if I just keep to myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Choosing to keep to yourself might seem easier, but it can sometimes reinforce that sense of loneliness. Have you had any thoughts about how you would like things to change with your classmates?

User: I would really like to have a better relationship with them, but I just don’t know how to reach out anymore. I'm afraid they’ll reject me again.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can be really powerful. What if we take a moment to explore what thoughts come to your mind when you think about reaching out to them? How do you feel in those moments?

User: I feel anxious and helpless. I worry that they might just dismiss me again, which makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about that. Let’s try to challenge some of those thoughts. What evidence do you have that reaching out will lead to rejection? Have there been any positive interactions that you can recall?

User: Actually, there was one time when we briefly chatted about a project, and they seemed okay at that moment. But I guess I just focus on the negative experiences more.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Wenwen. Noting the positive interactions can be a way to balance your perspective. How about creating small opportunities to connect with them about your shared projects? 

User: That sounds reasonable. Maybe I could ask for their input on a project or something. I just worry it wouldn’t lead to a real connection.

Consultant: It's a great first step, and it could lead to more meaningful interactions. If they respond positively, how might that change your feelings about your situation?

User: I suppose it would make me feel more included and less anxious in the dorm. I really want that.

Consultant: Balancing small steps like this can help you feel more connected. Would you like to set a specific goal for reaching out to them over the next week?

User: Yes, I think I could aim to ask one of them about a project this week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, taking one small step can be a powerful move toward breaking that isolation. How do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful—but also nervous. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous! Acknowledging those feelings is part of the process. How might you reassure yourself if things don’t go as planned after you reach out?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s just one interaction, and it doesn’t have to define our relationship. 

Consultant: Exactly! Seeing it as just one step in a larger journey can help reduce the pressure. What if we also brainstorm a few ways to handle situations if they don’t respond positively?

User: Maybe I could just give myself a break and not take it personally. I could also focus on my other friendships. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Focusing on self-compassion and other relationships can be very healing. How do you feel now, thinking about your goal and strategies?

User: I feel less anxious about the situation. I guess I just needed to talk it through. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Talking things through can often bring clarity. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to explore today regarding your situation?

User: No, I think we've covered a lot. I feel more prepared to speak with them now.

Consultant: That's wonderful! As we move forward, keep in mind that it’s okay to have ups and downs, too. You’re taking steps towards a more positive interaction. Let's check in on your progress next time.

User: Yes, I look forward to updating you on how it goes.

Consultant: Great! Take care of yourself, Wenwen. Remember, every little step counts. See you next time!

User: Thank you! See you!

Consultant: Hello Wenwen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. I've tried to join a new club to meet people, but I still feel lonely sometimes, especially when I compare myself to others.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've taken the step to join a new club. That’s a positive move toward improving your social situation! Can you tell me more about your experiences with this club? How did it feel to connect with new people?

User: It was a bit awkward at first, but I was able to talk to a couple of people. They seemed nice, but I still feel like I don't belong completely.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way when you’re stepping into a new environment. Building connections takes time. What thoughts do you have that make you feel like you don’t belong?

User: I keep thinking that they might not want to be friends with me or that I’m not interesting enough. Those thoughts make me anxious when I’m around them.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would create some anxiety for you. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, and is there any evidence that contradicts them?

User: Well, I guess they were friendly to me when we talked. But then I think about how they might just be polite and not really interested in getting to know me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of doubt and worry. Let’s try challenging that thinking. If a friend was in your shoes feeling this way, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would tell them that if people are being friendly, it’s a good sign and they should take it as an opportunity to engage more.

Consultant: That sounds like solid advice! You have the capacity to offer yourself the same encouragement. How might you apply that perspective to your interactions with the new friends you’re trying to make?

User: I suppose I could focus more on being open during conversations rather than worrying about how they see me. Maybe invite them to hang out more.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Being open and inviting can help you build those connections more naturally. Have you thought of any specific activities to suggest to them?

User: I was thinking of suggesting we grab coffee or do a study session together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Socializing over coffee or a study session can ease some of the tension. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous thinking about it, but also excited. I really hope it helps me connect better with them.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, and it’s a sign that you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it's okay to feel excited and anxious at the same time. What steps can you take to prepare yourself for this invitation?

User: I think I could plan a few topics to talk about and try to practice my approach a little in front of a mirror.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Practicing can boost your confidence and help ease any anxiety. What if you set a small goal for yourself regarding this invitation? 

User: Maybe I can aim to invite at least one person this week to join me for coffee.

Consultant: That’s a perfect goal! Keep it simple and approachable. After the invitation, how would you evaluate your feelings—what will success look like for you in this interaction?

User: If they agree to meet up and we can chat comfortably, I’d feel successful. Even if it’s just a casual talk.

Consultant: I love that your measure of success is based on the quality of the interaction rather than the outcome itself. That’s very reflective! How do you think you’ll feel after taking this step?

User: I hope I’ll feel more confident and less lonely, but I’m still a bit worried about how it will go.

Consultant: Those feelings are understandable, but remember that every step you take helps you grow. Let’s check in on these feelings in our next session. How can you remind yourself to be gentle with yourself regardless of the outcome?

User: I can tell myself it’s okay to feel anxious, and that simply trying is what matters right now.

Consultant: Exactly, Wenwen! Acknowledging your emotions is part of the process. As we wrap up, what are the most important insights you’re taking away today?

User: I’ll focus on being open in my new social interactions and remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. Taking small steps can lead to bigger changes.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You’re making meaningful progress. I’m proud of you for being willing to step into new experiences. Remember, I'm here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I feel supported and motivated to try. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Wenwen! Take care, and I look forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! I'm glad to see you today. I hope you're doing well. How do you feel about your interactions with your new friends recently?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better actually. The new friends I made in the club have been really warm and welcoming, which is nice. But I still feel anxious when I'm with them at times, like I might say something wrong and they'll judge me.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've made some new connections! Those feelings of anxiety are a common experience when building new relationships. What situations specifically make you feel anxious around them?

User: When we're chatting in a group, I sometimes hesitate to speak up. I worry my contributions won’t be good enough, and I might be ignored like my roommates do.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's understandable to feel nervous in those situations. It sounds like comparisons to your past experiences with your roommates might be influencing your current thoughts. What thoughts go through your mind when you're about to speak in a group?

User: I often think, "What if they don't find this interesting?" or "What if I sound silly?" These thoughts make me want to stay quiet.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create a barrier to speaking up. Let's challenge these ideas together. How much evidence do you have that they would judge you negatively? Have there been moments where they responded positively to you?

User: I guess there have been a few times when they laughed at my jokes or seemed engaged. But I just can't shake the fear of being ignored again.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've had some positive interactions! Those moments can serve as evidence that your contributions matter. What if we reframe your fear? Instead of assuming they'll ignore you, what if you viewed it as an opportunity to connect and share?

User: That sounds more positive! But I still struggle with it in practice. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to struggle with that. What if we think about some small, achievable goals for your next group interaction? For example, you could aim to share one thought or ask a question, no matter how small. How does that sound?

User: I can try that! It seems less daunting if I think about it as just one thing.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about taking small steps. And remember, it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly. Each experience builds your confidence. How do you feel about planning a specific scenario where you might practice this?

User: Maybe at our next club meeting? I could prepare one question to ask.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Preparing ahead can help ease your anxiety. Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself to challenge any negative thoughts during the meeting. Do you have any reframes that could help if you start feeling anxious?

User: I could tell myself that they like me and want to hear from me, not just ignore me.

Consultant: That's an excellent reframe! Keeping positive reinforcement in mind is essential. Would you like to write down some of these affirmations to use leading up to and during the meeting?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel more prepared and confident.

Consultant: Wonderful! You can keep them somewhere visible to remind yourself of your worth and the connections you’re building. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the direction we’re heading in?

User: I feel more hopeful and excited about socializing. I think these strategies could really help.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made great progress in recognizing and challenging those negative thoughts. Remember, it's a journey, and it's important to celebrate these steps. How do you envision applying these strategies in other areas of your life?

User: I think I can use this with my classmates too. Sometimes I feel the same way when I want to speak up in class discussions.

Consultant: Absolutely! The skills we practiced can be applied broadly. Keeping yourself open to sharing confidently can enhance your experiences everywhere. For our next session, let's talk about how things went with your new social situations and any challenges you faced.

User: Yes, I’ll note down my experiences and feelings for our next meeting. Thank you so much!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wenwen! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to take your time. Until next time, take care!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I remember you recently organized a club event and felt recognized for your efforts. How has that experience been for you so far?

User: Hi! Yes, organizing the event felt really great. It was nice to see people appreciating what I did. But I'm still struggling with my relationships in the dorm. The other girls don't talk to me, and it feels really isolating.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you had a positive experience with the event. However, it's understandable that feeling isolated in your dorm can overshadow that. Can you tell me more about how that isolation is affecting you?

User: I find it hard to concentrate on my studies because I feel lonely. Whenever I try to talk to them, they just ignore me. It makes me question my worth and whether I'm doing something wrong.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Wenwen. Feeling ignored can really affect your self-esteem and focus. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When they ignore you, what kind of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think maybe they don’t like me or that I'm not interesting enough to talk to. It makes me feel inadequate and anxious.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts of feeling inadequate when faced with their silence are quite powerful. Have you noticed how those thoughts shape your feelings in those moments?

User: Yes, when I think like that, I feel really anxious and sometimes even depressed. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop of negative feelings.

Consultant: That loop can be very difficult to break. It might help to think about how you would respond to a friend who felt the same way. What would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it's not their fault and that they deserve friends who appreciate them. I’d encourage them not to take it personally.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate of you. It shows you have a different perspective when you think about others. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself during these tough moments?

User: I guess I should try to remind myself that it’s not just about me. Maybe they have their reasons for behaving that way, and it doesn’t define my worth.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a significant realization. It’s important to separate their actions from your self-worth. What steps do you think you could take to enhance your social interactions, drawing from your recent positive experience?

User: Perhaps I could initiate more activities or invite them to join me in something. I think being proactive might help break the ice.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking that initiative could open up opportunities for connection. Do you have any specific activities in mind that you could propose?

User: Maybe a study group or a movie night. Something casual that doesn’t put too much pressure on anyone.

Consultant: Those ideas sound wonderful! Casual settings can promote bonding without overwhelming anyone. How do you feel about suggesting these activities to them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I’m also excited about the possibility. I guess it’s a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a positive way to frame it! Remember, feeling nervous is natural, but it also means you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s think about what you might say when you approach them about it.

User: I could say something like, “Hey, I’m planning a study group, and I’d love for you to join.” That feels straightforward enough.

Consultant: That’s perfect! It’s clear and inviting. When do you think you would feel ready to bring this up with them?

User: Maybe by the end of this week. I want to feel prepared and positive when I do it.

Consultant: Giving yourself time to prepare is a good strategy. How can you maintain that positive mindset as you approach this?

User: I could write down some positive affirmations about myself and remind myself of that supportive feedback I received from organizing the event.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Focusing on your strengths and those positive experiences can really bolster your confidence. Could you share one affirmation you think might help you?

User: I think I could say something like, “I am worthy of friendship, and I have valuable contributions to offer.”

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation, Wenwen! Reminding yourself of your worth can create a more supportive internal dialogue. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the steps we discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think I have a plan, and it feels good to have that clarity.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, building social connections takes time, and you are taking important steps toward that. How about we check in again soon to discuss how these experiences unfold for you?

User: Yes, I’d love that! Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wenwen. You’ve made great progress today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! Welcome back to our session. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, to be honest. Expanding my social circle has given me some comfort, but I still struggle a little with my dormmates. It’s like they intentionally ignore me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling better overall! It sounds like the new connections are helping. However, the situation with your dormmates seems challenging. Can you share more about how that makes you feel?

User: It really hurts, you know? I feel so isolated when I try to talk to them, and they just don’t acknowledge me. It feels like a constant reminder that I might not fit in.

Consultant: That sounds really painful and frustrating. Feeling ignored can definitely impact your sense of belonging. Let's explore this together. What thoughts go through your mind when you experience those moments of being ignored?

User: I often think that they must not like me, or that I did something wrong. I wonder if they talk about me when I’m not around. It makes me anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite distressing and lead to anxiety. Let’s take a moment to unpack that. Do you believe those thoughts are based on solid evidence, or could there be other explanations for their behavior?

User: I guess I don't really know. I mean, I haven't done anything directly to upset them. Sometimes I wonder if they’re just not in the mood to interact.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Wenwen. It's possible that their behavior isn't personal towards you. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you advise them to think about the situation?

User: I would probably tell them to give it time or to try to engage more with the others. I mean, I wouldn’t want my friend to feel bad about themselves.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Maybe you can apply that same advice to yourself. What if you tried engaging with them in a different way? Could there be a strategy that feels more comfortable for you?

User: I could try initiating light conversations or finding common interests. It just feels daunting sometimes because I fear rejection.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, as stepping out of your comfort zone can be challenging. Would you be open to practicing a few conversation starters together today?

User: Yes, I think practicing could really help! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a scenario where you bump into one of your dormmates. What would you say to break the ice?

User: Maybe I'd say, "Hey, I watched a great film recently. Have you seen anything interesting?" 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It shows interest and opens the door for them to share. How do you feel about saying that in a real situation?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s nice to have a prepared line.

Consultant: That’s a good sign! Nerves are normal, especially when reaching out to others. Let’s talk about how you can handle any potential awkwardness or silence after you initiate the conversation.

User: I suppose I could share something else about the film or ask another question if they don’t respond.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a few follow-up questions ready can help keep the conversation flowing. What kind of things could you ask if they seem uninterested?

User: Maybe I could ask about their classes or weekend plans. Those seem like safe topics.

Consultant: Those are excellent alternatives! They not only keep the conversation light but also create more opportunities for connection. How does this approach make you feel about interacting with them?

User: I feel a little more prepared and less anxious. Having some options makes it feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Preparation can be incredibly empowering. Now, remember that if things don’t go as expected, it’s not necessarily a reflection of you; social interactions can be unpredictable.

User: That’s reassuring to hear. I think I often take their reactions too personally.

Consultant: It’s very common to feel that way. Let’s shift our focus for a moment—what progress have you noticed in your social interactions since we last spoke?

User: I've been attending more campus events, and I've met a few new people! It's been encouraging.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Wenwen! Engaging with more people shows your courage and determination. How can you maintain that positive momentum moving forward?

User: I think I'll keep attending events, and maybe focus on building those new connections more instead of fixating on my dormmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy plan! Engaging in environments where you feel welcomed can further boost your confidence. I’d love to hear how that goes for you in our next meeting.

User: I will! I really appreciate the support and guidance you've given me. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great working through these thoughts and strategies together. As we wrap up today, what’s your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: It’s important to challenge my negative thoughts and focus on the positive connections I’m making. 

Consultant: That's an excellent realization! Remember, you have the tools to manage your feelings and continue building those relationships. I’m proud of your progress, Wenwen. If you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident about facing my dormmates now. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wenwen! I'm glad you're back for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I feel a lot better. My relationship with one of my dorm mates has improved a bit. I felt much more relaxed after we talked openly. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that conversation had a positive impact on you. Can you share more about what changes you've noticed since then?

User: Well, I feel less isolated now. Previously, I was very lonely since the other girls wouldn't talk to me. But this improvement makes me hopeful that we can all get along better.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling more hopeful. Building relationships takes time, and it seems you're on the right path. What specific moments or feelings during your conversation made you feel more connected?

User: I think just being able to talk without feeling judged was really helpful. I felt like she was actually listening to me, and we found some common ground.

Consultant: That's really important, having that sense of being heard can make a big difference. How do you think this open communication can help you in your relationships moving forward?

User: I guess it shows me that opening up can lead to better understanding. I might try doing that more with the others, even if it’s scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Communication can encourage more positive interactions. It sounds like you're willing to take that step, which is fantastic. What kind of strategies can you think of to help you approach those conversations with the others?

User: Maybe I can start with small talk or ask them about their day, just to break the ice a bit.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Starting with light topics can ease the tension. How do you think you'll feel if things don’t go as planned when you reach out?

User: I might feel disappointed, and it could remind me of the past. But I think if I keep trying, someone will eventually respond.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but it’s great that you’re focusing on the possibility of progress. Remember, even small steps are still steps forward. What can you remind yourself of to stay positive if you face those challenges?

User: I could remind myself of this recent success with the one dorm mate and how it made me feel. 

Consultant: That's a powerful reminder. Reflecting on positive interactions can reinforce your confidence. Have you thought about how you can maintain the progress you've made so far?

User: I think I should continue to engage with my dorm mates and not isolate myself. I want to actively participate in conversations.

Consultant: That's a solid plan. Engaging consistently will help solidify those connections. We’ve discussed some great strategies today. How are you feeling about taking these steps?

User: I feel encouraged! I’m ready to try reaching out more and seeing what happens.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let's summarize your key insights and strategies. What do you think will help you the most moving forward?

User: I think it’s really about being open, starting small, and not giving up if I face setbacks.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are key takeaways. Remember, each effort counts. How do you feel about coming back to share your experiences next time?

User: I’d like that. I want to keep track of my progress and see how things change.

Consultant: That sounds great! I believe you have the tools to manage your relationships successfully. You've shown so much growth already. If challenges arise, just remember what we've discussed today. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more confident about moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wenwen! I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support. Take care!

User: Thank you! I'll see you next time.
