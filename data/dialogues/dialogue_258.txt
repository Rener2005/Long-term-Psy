Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today. I’d like to start by talking about how you’ve been feeling lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really upset recently. I made some inappropriate comments and shared a picture in a group chat with my friends. Now, I feel like they are avoiding me, and I’m really confused about what I did wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing feelings of rejection and sadness over this situation. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you share more about how you're feeling when you think about your friends' reactions?

User: I just feel embarrassed and lost. I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but now I keep replaying it in my head and I don’t know how to fix it.

Consultant: That must be really difficult for you. Replaying those moments in your mind can create a lot of discomfort. What do you think led you to make those comments and share that picture in the first place?

User: I guess I was just trying to be funny or fit in. But it seems like it backfired completely. Now I feel like I don’t understand how to communicate properly with them.

Consultant: It seems like you had a genuine intention to connect with your friends, but it didn’t turn out as you hoped. This can happen to anyone! Let’s explore your communication style a bit more. When you’re thinking about how to express yourself, what thoughts come up for you?

User: I often overthink what to say. My brain goes a bit blank, and I try to say something quick, but then I worry it might not be taken the right way.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, especially in tense social situations. You mentioned feeling like your brain goes blank. What kind of thoughts do you have when you feel that way? 

User: I just think that I’ll mess up again, or that they’ll judge me. Sometimes I think, "Why can’t I just say the right thing?"

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging. Let’s take a moment to challenge them. What evidence do you have that your friends are judging you, or that you always mess up?

User: I guess I don’t have solid proof… it's just how I feel. Maybe they’re just disappointed, but I’m not sure if they truly think poorly of me.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing that your feelings might not be the full story. Remember, emotions can sometimes lead us to think the worst. If you were to talk to a friend in your situation, what would you advise them to consider?

User: I’d probably tell them that one mistake doesn’t define their worth, and that it’s important to communicate openly about it.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective! Let’s use that insight for yourself. How could that advice change the way you approach your friends now?

User: Maybe I could reach out and apologize sincerely. I could explain what I meant and hope they understand?

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward. When we can clarify intentions, it can really help repair relationships. How do you feel about approaching them like that?

User: I’m really nervous, but I think it’s worth a try. I hope they’ll give me a chance to explain.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous! Acknowledging your feelings is a good first step. What are some ways we could prepare you for that conversation?

User: Maybe I could think through what I want to say, or even practice it with you? I just want to sound sincere.

Consultant: Practicing can definitely help build your confidence. What key points do you want to convey when you apologize?

User: I want to tell them I’m really sorry, that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone, and that I’ve learned from this experience.

Consultant: Those are powerful points to express. Let’s take a moment to role-play this apology. I’ll be your friend, and you can practice your approach.

User: Okay, I suppose I’ll start. “Hey, I wanted to talk to you about what happened. I’m really sorry for my comments and the picture I shared…”

Consultant: That’s a great start! How do you think I—your friend—would respond to your apology?

User: I’m not sure. Hopefully, they’d understand. But I guess I just have to see how they react.

Consultant: Exactly, it’s a process. Being open and vulnerable can sometimes surprise us with positive responses. What do you think your next steps will be after the apology?

User: If they respond well, I hope we can talk more about it. If not, I guess I need to give them some space and reflect on how I can improve.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach. It’s important to respect their feelings while also continuing to work on improving your communication skills. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel a little better. Understanding my feelings and practicing what to say helps. But I still feel upset about everything.

Consultant: It’s okay to still feel upset. Healing often takes time, and recognizing your feelings is a solid step forward. Let’s keep building on this momentum. We can explore more communication strategies next time we meet.

User: Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll try to reach out to them and see how it goes.

Consultant: You're welcome! I’m here to support you. You’re taking brave steps, and I believe you can navigate this situation with confidence. Remember to be kind to yourself in the process. 

User: I will. I’m looking forward to our next session. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it too. Take care, and I'll see you then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you're feeling and what you've been experiencing with your friends lately.

User: Hi. I've been really trying to connect with my friends more, but it seems like they are still distant. I apologized for what happened, but I feel like I'm being pushed away. It's frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, C. It seems like you've been putting in a lot of effort to reach out, yet you're still feeling rejected. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it made you feel?

User: Well, I think I misunderstood something they said, and I reacted poorly. After that, I apologized, but I still feel that there's a wall between us. It feels like no matter what I do, I can't break through.

Consultant: I can see why you feel frustrated. It must be disheartening to feel like your efforts aren't enough. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way? 

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not good at making friends or that my friends don't really care about me. It feels like I'm meeting the same wall every time I try to talk to them.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy, C. It’s understandable to feel down when you believe your friends don't care. Let's explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you think supports the idea that your friends don’t care about you?

User: I guess they sometimes don't respond quickly or seem busy when I reach out. But I know they have their own lives too.

Consultant: That’s a good observation. It sounds like there's a part of you that understands they might be busy, yet another part that feels dismissed. Think about a time when they did respond positively. What might that suggest about their feelings toward you?

User: There were times when they did respond and were enthusiastic. It’s just hard to remember that when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to focus on the negatives during tough times, C. Now, let’s think about how you could communicate your feelings to them. What do you think might happen if you openly shared your feelings about the distance you’re sensing?

User: I worry that they might think I'm overreacting or that I’m too needy. I'd hate to make things worse.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. However, expressing your feelings doesn’t need to come off as needy. What if you framed it more as wanting to understand them better? It could open up the conversation without putting pressure on them.

User: That sounds less intimidating, actually. I could say something like, “I've noticed a distance and I’d like to understand it.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That could help you express yourself while inviting them to share their perspectives. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. It sounds okay, and I think it would help clear the air.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, C. Remember, communication is a two-way street. It will also give them space to express if there's something they are feeling too. Are there any specific skills or strategies you’d like to work on today to help you feel more prepared for that conversation?

User: I think I need help with how to express my feelings without getting too emotional or defensive.

Consultant: Let's practice using “I” statements. For example, you might say, “I feel a little left out when I don’t hear from you.” This focuses on your feelings without placing blame. Would you like to try crafting a few sentences using this technique?

User: Sure! I’ll try. “I feel confused when I sense a distance from you”... How does that sound?

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It clearly expresses your feelings without sounding accusatory. Would you like to explore another example to reinforce the technique?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s think of a situation where you felt particularly left out. We can create an “I” statement based on that. Can you share one of those moments with me?

User: There was a time they all went out without me. I felt so left out. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. How about saying, “I felt sad when I heard about the outing and wasn’t invited”? This expresses your emotion and opens the door for discussion without making them feel guilty.

User: That makes sense. It feels less confrontational. 

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, the goal is to foster understanding and openness. Do you feel ready to put this into practice, or is there anything else you’d like to work on?

User: I think I am ready to try this! I want to feel less scared about reaching out.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. You’ve developed some communication skills and practiced expressing your feelings effectively. How might you apply these skills when you talk to your friends?

User: I’ll use “I” statements and focus on how I feel rather than making it about them. That should help.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but you’re taking steps toward improving your connections. If you feel overwhelmed again, we can work through it together. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help today. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, C. Remember, you have the tools to connect with your friends better. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance. Take care until next time!

User: I will! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello C! I'm glad you're here for our session today. Before we dive in, can you tell me how you’ve been feeling recently, especially regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling a bit hopeful since I managed to communicate better with some friends after a misunderstanding. But I still feel stuck because it didn’t go as well as I had hoped.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a mix of hope and some lingering frustration regarding those interactions. Can you share more about the misunderstanding and how it makes you feel?

User: Sure. I think I misunderstood a friend's message, which made things awkward. Although we talked it out, I still doubt my ability to communicate effectively. I worry about making the same mistake again.

Consultant: I can see why that would be concerning for you, C. It's tough when communication doesn't go as planned. What specific thoughts or beliefs do you have about your communication skills after these experiences?

User: I often think that I might say the wrong thing or not express myself well. It makes me hesitant to get involved in conversations, especially in social settings. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite difficult to navigate. Can you identify any particular situations where this fear of saying the wrong thing has affected you recently?

User: Yes, there was a gathering last week. I wanted to join a conversation but ended up not saying anything. I just sat quietly and felt like everyone was judging me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, C. When you're in situations like that, what thoughts go through your mind? Specifically, what are you telling yourself in those moments?

User: I tell myself that people will notice I'm not contributing and think I'm awkward or not smart enough to join in. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. What evidence do you have that others are judging you in that way?

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence; it's just a feeling I get. I guess I've never really had anyone openly say anything negative about me.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight to have, C. It seems that your feelings may be influencing your perception of the situation. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their worries?

User: I’d probably tell them to relax and that it’s okay to not be perfect in social situations. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to be kind to yourself, just as you would with a friend. What if we experimented with challenging that critical voice you hear when you're in those situations? How would you feel about practicing some self-compassion?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think I need to learn how to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with some practical strategies. Next time you're feeling anxious in a social setting, what’s one small thing you could say to remind yourself that it’s okay to be imperfect?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "It's okay; everyone makes mistakes, and I can just be myself."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mantra! Let’s also think about specific scenarios where you can practice this self-talk. Can you identify a social situation coming up where you could try this approach?

User: There’s a study group meeting later this week. I could try to engage in conversation there.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! Before that meeting, it might help to prepare a couple of topics you feel comfortable discussing. What do you think you might want to talk about with your group?

User: I’d like to discuss some upcoming projects and maybe ask for help with some difficult topics. 

Consultant: Excellent! Planning some discussion points can help ease your anxiety. And don’t forget to remind yourself of your self-compassion mantra. How do you feel about approaching the study group with this mindset?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it. It helps to have a plan and a reminder to be kind to myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Progressing in your social interactions is about taking small, manageable steps. As we continue in our sessions, we can practice different social scenarios to further build your confidence. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I’d like to feel more comfortable in those situations.

Consultant: Let’s keep working together towards that goal. Remember, it’s all part of the process, and each step you take will build upon the last. Do you have any specific concerns or situations you’d like to explore more in our next sessions?

User: I think it would be helpful to practice more situations, especially ones I find challenging, like initiating conversations.

Consultant: Absolutely! We'll dedicate time to that in our upcoming sessions. For now, take the insights we’ve discussed today and try them out. I believe in your ability to improve and adapt. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and suggestions.

Consultant: It's my pleasure, C! You've made meaningful strides today. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any feelings or thoughts you'd like to share before our next session. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. 

User: I will, thank you! I feel more hopeful about my communication skills now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let's carry that hope into our next session, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in the study group. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi there! I've been feeling a bit more confident in social situations. I tried using some of the communication techniques we talked about, and it did help a little.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you are starting to feel more comfortable with your communication skills. Can you share a specific situation where you applied these techniques?

User: Sure! There was a small gathering with my classmates. I made an effort to initiate conversations, and I actually talked to a few people I hadn’t interacted with before.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic step forward! How did it feel to initiate those conversations?

User: It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but once I got into it, it felt rewarding. I was surprised by how some people responded positively!

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious at the start. It sounds like you received some positive feedback, which must be encouraging. What thoughts went through your mind during this experience?

User: I thought about everything we discussed in our previous sessions. I reminded myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that every conversation is a chance to learn.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! Keeping that perspective can really help reduce pressure. Were there any moments where you felt your old habits creeping back in?

User: Yes, there were times when I hesitated to speak up. I worried that I might not say the right thing or that others wouldn’t be interested.

Consultant: It’s great that you were aware of these thoughts. Can we explore how those thoughts affect your feelings and behaviors in social situations?

User: Sure, when I think that way, I usually feel anxious and sometimes I end up just staying quiet instead of joining the conversation.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Let's identify any cognitive distortions in those thoughts. Do you think you might be overgeneralizing or catastrophizing the situation?

User: I guess I do assume the worst outcomes, like thinking people will judge me if I say something silly.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re engaging in some "all-or-nothing" thinking. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this idea?

User: I don’t have concrete evidence; it’s just a fear I have. Most of my classmates seemed friendly, so it’s unreasonable to think they’d judge me harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to challenge those negative thoughts. If a friend was in your position, how would you advise them to think about it?

User: I would tell them to focus on the positives and remember that everyone makes mistakes. I would encourage them to just be themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach. Now, let’s discuss some practical steps. What could you do next time you find yourself feeling anxious about speaking up?

User: I could remind myself of the positive responses I received last time and maybe even think of a few conversation starters beforehand.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Preparing conversation starters can make it easier to engage with others. How do you feel about putting this plan into action?

User: I feel optimistic! Having a plan makes me less anxious. I think I can handle the next social event better now.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Let’s also think of some self-affirmations you can use to build your confidence before the event. What positive statements can you remind yourself of?

User: I could say, "I am capable of having good conversations," or "It’s okay to be myself.”

Consultant: Those affirmations sound empowering! Let’s wrap up by reflecting on your progress. What would you say has been your biggest achievement since we started working together?

User: I think my biggest achievement is realizing that I can actually connect with people and that I’m not as awkward as I thought.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! As we conclude today’s session, what do you think you’ll take forward into your next social interactions?

User: I’ll take the confidence I’ve built, the techniques I’ve learned, and the knowledge that it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, social skills improve with practice, and you’re already making great strides. If you need support, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I look forward to applying what I’ve learned and hopefully expanding my social circle more. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of your progress and the steps you're taking. Keep being kind to yourself, and I look forward to discussing your successes in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, C! Welcome back to our session. It sounds like you've made some progress with your social interactions since our last meeting. How are you feeling about your social life these days?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling more open to socializing. I really enjoyed the positive feedback I got during the group activity. It made me want to connect more with others, but I still feel a bit nervous sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more open and receiving positive feedback! That can really boost your confidence. What are some specific situations where you've felt nervous despite your desire to connect?

User: Well, I find it challenging when I have to initiate conversations, especially in larger groups. I worry about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about initiating conversations, especially in larger groups. Let’s explore this feeling together. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt this way? What were your thoughts during that moment?

User: Sure. Last week at a gathering, I wanted to join a group chat, but I kept thinking, "What if they don’t want to talk to me?" I ended up just standing there quietly.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that thought created a barrier for you. You mentioned, "What if they don’t want to talk to me?"—that sounds like a negative thought. What emotions did that thought bring up for you?

User: I felt anxious and uncomfortable. It made me second-guess myself a lot.

Consultant: That makes sense. Anxiety can really take over in those moments. Let's try to unpack that thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to talk to you? 

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It's just this nagging fear I have when I’m in those situations.

Consultant: It's interesting how that fear can arise even without strong evidence. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you advise them to think about it?

User: I’d probably tell them that most people are just trying to have fun and make connections, so they shouldn't worry too much.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you know that people generally want to connect. Let’s try shifting your thought pattern. Instead of focusing on what might go wrong, how about considering what could go right when approaching a group? 

User: That sounds helpful. I think I can try reminding myself that it’s okay to just be myself and see where the conversation goes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Focusing on being yourself can take off some pressure. How do you want to implement this in your next social situation?

User: I think I’ll aim to join a conversation at the next group event and remind myself to just enjoy the moment instead of overthinking it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging in the moment can really help ease those nerves. How would you feel if the conversation doesn’t go as planned?

User: I'd probably feel disappointed, but I guess I could remind myself that not all conversations have to flow perfectly.

Consultant: Absolutely! That mindset is key. Remember that it’s a learning experience, and sometimes conversations can surprise you. What other strategies do you think might help you during these interactions?

User: I could practice some small talk topics or questions to have ready in my mind, just in case I need them.

Consultant: Great idea! Having a few conversation starters can make you feel more prepared. What topics are you most comfortable discussing?

User: I usually enjoy talking about movies or music. I could also ask about people’s experiences in school.

Consultant: Those are excellent topics! They can easily lead to deeper discussions. How about we set a goal for you to approach at least one person and start a conversation next time?

User: That sounds manageable. I could even set a specific goal, like talking to two new people.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Two new people is a great challenge to take on. How do you feel about going into this next event with that intention?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous too. It's a mix of emotions.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Embracing both excitement and nervousness shows you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Are there any techniques we could discuss to help manage that anxiety before the event?

User: Maybe some breathing exercises to keep me calm before I join in?

Consultant: Breathing exercises are a fantastic way to ground yourself. Taking deep breaths can help you relax and focus. Would you like to try a quick breathing technique now?

User: Yes, I’d like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four, and then breathe out for six counts. Ready? In… 1, 2, 3, 4... hold... 1, 2, 3, 4... and out… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: That was really refreshing! I think I can use that when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you feel overwhelmed. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about your interactions and yourself?

User: I’ve learned that I need to challenge my negative thoughts and remember that connections are what I want. I feel more confident in the steps I can take.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, C. It sounds like you're making great strides in understanding yourself and your social interactions. I’m excited for you to put these strategies into action. 

User: Thank you for your help! I feel more prepared for the next step. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to grow your social skills further. Before we finish, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I think I'm good for now. Thanks again!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember to celebrate each small victory in your journey. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello C! I'm glad you're here today. It's great to hear about the improvements you've made in your social confidence. Can you share how you've been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling quite satisfied with how I connect with new friends. It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I am willing to keep working on my social skills.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're in a really positive place. What specific aspects of your social interactions do you feel are most improved, and how would you like to build on this progress?

User: I think I’ve become more at ease in conversations. I used to struggle with small talk, but now I can engage more comfortably. I want to further enhance my ability to initiate conversations and maintain them.

Consultant: It sounds like initiating and maintaining conversations is a key focus for you moving forward. Let’s explore some strategies that could help you feel more confident in these situations. Do you have any particular scenarios in mind where you'd like to practice these skills?

User: Yes, especially when I'm with my classmates or at social events. Sometimes I still feel a bit shy about approaching groups.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Starting conversations in groups can feel daunting. Would you like to brainstorm some conversation starters or questions that you could use in those situations?

User: That sounds helpful! I usually get stuck on what to say once I approach someone. 

Consultant: Let's work on that together. Think about topics you enjoy discussing. For instance, asking about a recent class project or sharing something interesting you learned can be a good way to engage others. What do you think about that approach? 

User: Yeah, that makes sense! I can definitely see myself using those topics instead of feeling too pressured to come up with something perfect right away.

Consultant: Exactly! The goal is to keep it light and natural. What about practicing those starters in a safe environment, like with a friend or during a casual group study? 

User: I can try that! I think practicing with a friend would ease my nerves. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea, C! Practicing in a comfortable context can really build your confidence. How do you feel about setting small social goals for yourself, like initiating a conversation during your next study group? 

User: That sounds doable! I can aim to speak to at least one new person next time, just to keep pushing myself a bit.

Consultant: Wonderful! Setting small, achievable goals is a great way to maintain your progress. Remember, the goal is to enjoy the process and learn along the way. How do you feel about discussing more long-term social development strategies today?

User: Sure! I want to make sure this improvement lasts, so I’d like to hear more about that.

Consultant: Great! One effective long-term strategy is to continue practicing various social scenarios regularly—like engaging in different clubs or activities. This helps reinforce your skills. Are there specific activities you’re interested in?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a club or group that aligns with my interests. It might be a good way to meet people and practice.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a wonderful way to connect with others! It allows for regular interaction in a shared context, which can help you ease into conversations more naturally. What kind of club are you considering?

User: I’m considering a book club or maybe a sports group. I enjoy discussing stories and it could help me meet people who share the same interests.

Consultant: Both options sound like fantastic choices! Engaging in activities that you enjoy can really help you relax and be yourself while meeting new people. Have you thought about any specific goals for these clubs?

User: I think my goal would be to simply participate actively in discussions and to try to remember names. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Actively participating and remembering names are great ways to foster connections. What strategies do you think you might use to help with remembering names?

User: I could try repeating the names after someone introduces themselves. That might help me remember.

Consultant: Absolutely! Repeating names can be very effective. You can also try associating something memorable with the person, which makes it easier to recall later. How are you feeling about the progress you’ve made today in our discussion?

User: I feel positive! I have actionable goals now, and I’m excited to put them into practice.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, C! It sounds like you're in a good place for maintaining and further developing your social skills. As we wrap up today, let's briefly summarize what you'll take away from our session.

User: I’ll focus on practicing conversation starters with friends, aim to initiate discussions in my study group, and try to join a club that interests me.

Consultant: That’s a great summary! You’ve set clear, achievable goals. Remember that it’s a process, and it’s okay to take small steps. If challenges arise, don’t hesitate to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, C. It’s been wonderful working with you. Remember, you’ve got the skills to manage and enhance your social interactions. I believe in your progress, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next time!
