Consultant: Hello Lin Feng, it's good to see you today. I appreciate you being here. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with school. My recent exam scores were disappointing and it just makes me doubt myself more. 

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure from school and your exam results are really weighing on you. Can you share more about what thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your exams?

User: I feel like I’m going to fail and that everyone else is doing better than me. It makes me think maybe I’m just not good enough.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy can be really challenging to deal with. When you think you’re not good enough, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really sad and hopeless. There are moments I even think life would be better if I just... didn’t exist. 

Consultant: That sounds very serious and I'm really sorry to hear that you feel this way. It's important we talk about these feelings. Let’s explore a bit, can you recall any specific thoughts that lead you to feel hopeless?

User: I think about how everyone expects me to do well, especially my parents. When I don’t meet those expectations, I just feel like I’m disappointing them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel pressured by others' expectations. It shows how much you care about their views. Have you noticed if these thoughts have a specific pattern or triggers in your daily life?

User: It usually happens after I get my grades back. I just focus on the negatives and forget about the positives, like the times I did well.

Consultant: That’s a common thinking pattern, and it can create a cycle of negativity. What would it look like for you to notice those positives in your achievements, alongside recognizing where you can improve?

User: I guess I would feel slightly better? But it’s hard to think about the good things when I’m so focused on what went wrong.

Consultant: That’s a fair point, Lin Feng. It’s completely normal to get caught up in negatives. Can you think of a time when you felt proud of an achievement, no matter how small?

User: Maybe when I finished a school project on time. I did feel good about that.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Finishing a project is definitely something to be proud of. Could we reframe that experience? Instead of just focusing on your grades, can we focus on the effort you put in to complete that project?

User: I suppose that makes sense. I did work hard on it.

Consultant: Great! Recognizing your effort can be empowering. Let’s also explore how you can apply this thinking to your exams. When preparing for exams, what strategies could you use to balance your focus on both your strengths and areas for growth?

User: Maybe I can set smaller goals, like just studying for an hour and then taking a break?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Breaking down your study time with small breaks will help alleviate pressure. How does thinking about your study sessions in this way make you feel?

User: It feels more manageable. I can see how that might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Yes, making it manageable can definitely reduce that sense of being overwhelmed. So moving forward, how do you feel about setting those small goals for your studies this week?

User: I think I can do that. It sounds much less stressful than cramming everything in one go.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Small steps can lead to major change. Also, whenever you feel those negative thoughts creeping in, remember the successful moments like completing that project. How do you think you might remind yourself of that during stressful times?

User: Maybe I can write it down somewhere or tell a friend about it.

Consultant: Writing it down is a brilliant strategy! Sharing with friends also helps you connect and feel less isolated. Lastly, how are you feeling about our conversation today? 

User: I feel a bit lighter. Talking about things out loud helps a lot.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You're taking positive steps today, and I hope you continue to practice these techniques. Remember, it's okay to reach out when you're feeling down. 

User: Thanks. I appreciate talking through this with you. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Lin Feng. You've shown great courage in being here and discussing your feelings. I look forward to seeing how you progress next time. 

User: Me too! I’ll try to keep working on it.

Consultant: Excellent! Keep practicing those strategies, and remember, I’m here whenever you need support. See you next time! 

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially with school and your relationships with classmates?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really uneasy. My relationships with my classmates seem tense, and I often doubt my own abilities. It’s frustrating, especially with exams coming up soon.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure from both your relationships and the upcoming exams. Could you share a bit more about what specific situations make you feel uneasy with your classmates?

User: Well, just hanging out with them makes me anxious. I worry they might judge me or think I'm not good enough. Sometimes, I feel like they talk behind my back, and it makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: That's understandable, Lin Feng. Feeling judged can be very distressing. When you think about those interactions, what specific thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think things like, "They must think I’m a loser," or "I’ll never fit in." These thoughts make me feel really tense and sad.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really weighing on you. Let's explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, or could there be alternative explanations?

User: I guess I don't have strong evidence. It's more of an assumption based on how I feel in those moments. But it feels so real, you know?

Consultant: Absolutely, it makes sense. Emotions can create very powerful thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about those feelings or thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to not take things so seriously and that it’s okay not to be perfect. Maybe they just need to be themselves.

Consultant: That's great advice! Now, let's think about applying that to your situation. What do you think would happen if you tried to challenge those negative thoughts the next time you’re with your classmates?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that they probably don’t think those things about me. I could focus on just having fun instead of worrying about what they think.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a good approach. What activities or situations do you think you could engage in with your classmates to help practice that mindset?

User: Maybe I could join them in some group study sessions or participate more in class discussions. It might help me feel more included.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging more can foster connections. How do you feel about initiating some of those interactions?

User: I’m a bit scared, honestly. What if they still judge me or reject me?

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel scared about that. However, reframing your thoughts could help. Instead of thinking about rejection, consider viewing it as an opportunity to learn and connect. How does that perspective feel?

User: It feels a bit less intimidating, actually. I guess it’s worth a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Let’s think about some small steps you can take. Is there a particular group or situation where you feel you could start engaging more?

User: I think I could start with my science group. We often work together, so it wouldn’t be too out of place.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent starting point! What specific action could you take in that group to engage more?

User: Maybe I could ask a question related to our project or offer to help someone with their part. That might break the ice.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Lin Feng! Asking questions and offering help can pave the way for better interactions. How do you feel about setting a goal to do that in your next session with them?

User: I’m feeling a little more positive about it. I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we talk about improving these relationships, let’s also recognize your upcoming exams. How are you feeling about them?

User: Honestly, really worried. I doubt I can perform well, especially with everything else on my mind.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Balancing social anxiety with exam pressure can be tough. What thoughts do you have about your current study habits or preparation?

User: I don’t think I’m studying as effectively as I should be. I keep getting distracted and anxious.

Consultant: Let's tackle that. Can you identify any specific distractions or negative thoughts that come up while studying?

User: I often think that even if I study hard, I won’t be able to remember anything, which leads to me giving up.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. Let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have for thinking you wouldn't remember, and can you reflect on past successes in studying?

User: I guess I’ve done okay in the past, especially when I actually focused. I tend to forget when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Maybe breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable parts could help. What do you think about planning some focused study time?

User: That sounds doable. I could also take breaks in between to reduce anxiety.

Consultant: Perfect! Setting up a study schedule with breaks might help in easing your worry. How about we set a goal for your study sessions leading up to the exams?

User: I’d like that. I want to create a schedule that allows me to prepare without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! As we wrap up today’s session, can you summarize what you plan to focus on in the coming days?

User: I’ll work on engaging with my classmates in science, challenge my negative thoughts, and create a practical study schedule. 

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan, Lin Feng! Remember, it's about taking small steps. If you apply these strategies and reflect on your feelings after each one, you might see progress. Keep me updated, okay?

User: I will! Thank you for your help today. It really means a lot to me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling pretty down and anxious, especially with mid-term exams coming up. I find it really hard to focus, and my sleep isn’t getting any better.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the pressure from the exams is weighing heavily on you, affecting both your focus and sleep. What do you think is making you feel so anxious about the upcoming exams?

User: I keep worrying that I won’t do well. I really want to perform better, but it feels like no matter how hard I try, it's never good enough.

Consultant: That’s tough, and it’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the added pressure of exams. Let’s explore that thought a bit more. What specific thoughts pop into your mind when you think about not performing well?

User: I often think that if I fail, my parents will be disappointed in me, and I'll be a failure. It feels like everything rides on these exams.

Consultant: Those are some heavy thoughts, Lin Feng. It seems you’re feeling a lot of pressure not only from yourself but also from the fear of disappointing your parents. Can you tell me how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and hopeless. Sometimes I think there's no point in studying at all because I’ll just end up disappointing everyone anyway.

Consultant: I can see why those thoughts would make you feel hopeless. However, let’s consider whether there might be other ways to interpret your situation. What evidence do you have that performing poorly would mean you’re a failure or that your parents would be disappointed?

User: Well, I just know they have high expectations for me, and I don’t want to let them down. But I guess I haven’t really thought of any specific evidence besides that.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. Sometimes our worries can exaggerate the situation. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about handling these expectations and the fear of failure?

User: I suppose I’d tell them to do their best and that it’s okay to not be perfect. But I have a hard time believing that for myself.

Consultant: You raised an important point. It's often easier to offer kindness to others than to ourselves. What if we tried to practice that same kindness and understanding in your situation? How would it feel to allow yourself to approach your studies with a mindset of doing your best rather than aiming for perfection?

User: That could help, I think. It would probably make me feel less pressured. 

Consultant: I believe it could! Now, let’s focus on some practical strategies to manage your anxiety. Have you ever tried relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness?

User: I’ve heard of them, but I’ve never really tried. I’m not sure they would help.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel skeptical, but these techniques can be very effective. Progressive muscle relaxation, for instance, involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups. It can help release physical tension and reduce anxiety. Would you be open to trying it together sometime?

User: Sure, that sounds worth a shot!

Consultant: Great! We can incorporate it into our next session. For now, how about we discuss some specific study strategies that you can use in preparation for your exams?

User: Yeah, I could use some help with that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! One useful technique is breaking your study material into smaller chunks and setting specific goals for each study session. Doing so can make studying feel less overwhelming. How do you usually plan your study sessions?

User: I usually just try to study everything at once, which never works out well.

Consultant: That’s understandable, and it’s a common approach. Allowing yourself to study in smaller, manageable segments is often more effective. How about you try dedicating 30 minutes to a subject, take a short break, and then switch to another?

User: I could try that. It sounds more doable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also make a plan for your sleep. Good sleep is crucial for managing stress. Have you noticed any patterns in what affects your sleep quality?

User: I think it’s mostly that I stay up too late studying or scrolling through my phone.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. Establishing a bedtime routine could be helpful. How does the idea of setting a specific time to stop studying and unplugging from screens sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful, but I’m worried I’ll fall behind if I stop too early.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about falling behind, but remember that adequate rest can actually improve your focus and retention. How about you start by setting a small goal, like putting your phone away an hour before bed and gradually adjusting from there?

User: I think I can manage that!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m really proud of the steps you're willing to take. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we've discussed today. 

User: Okay.

Consultant: We explored your feelings around exam pressure, practiced shifting your perspective on failure, and discussed strategies for studying and improving your sleep. How do you feel about all this?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it all. I think I can start making those changes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it's all about small steps. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you. Let’s check in again soon on how your efforts are going. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Lin Feng! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I'm glad you could join me for today's session. How have you been feeling about participating in the group activities lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m still feeling a bit anxious about it. I have some new thoughts about joining in, but I find myself second-guessing myself a lot.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about new experiences like group activities. Can you share with me what specific thoughts pop into your mind when you think about participating in those activities?

User: I often think that I might embarrass myself or that I won't know what to say, which makes me hesitant to join in.

Consultant: I understand that these thoughts can be really overwhelming. When you think about embarrassing yourself, what kind of feelings does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really uneasy and even a little panicked. I also feel like I want to avoid the situation altogether.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoidance can feel safe in the moment, but it often doesn’t help with anxiety in the long run. If you didn’t worry about embarrassing yourself, how do you think that would change your experience in the group?

User: I think if I wasn't worried, I would feel more comfortable to just speak up and maybe even enjoy the activities.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a desire to engage more without the weight of that anxiety. Let's explore this thought of embarrassment. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts that thought?

User: Well, I did join the last group activity, and although I was nervous, nobody seemed to mind what I said. Maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It seems like your experience in the group wasn’t as negative as your mind suggested. What alternative thought could you hold on to that might help you feel less anxious?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s okay to make mistakes, and most people are focused on having fun rather than on judging others.

Consultant: That's a fantastic thought! Remembering that your worth isn’t tied to being perfect can really help ease your anxiety. How might you practice this new way of thinking in your next group session?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is there to enjoy themselves, just like I am. Maybe I could even challenge myself to speak up at least once.

Consultant: I love that idea! Setting a small challenge can help build your confidence. What types of group activities do you feel most drawn to, where you might feel comfortable to start interacting more?

User: I think I enjoy sports and games more, as they have a natural way to bring people together. 

Consultant: That’s a great choice! Engaging in sports can create a sense of teamwork and connection. How do you feel about the idea of starting with a sports activity to practice your interaction skills?

User: I think that sounds good! It’ll give me something to focus on besides just talking, which sometimes feels really hard.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the activity can reduce the pressure of conversation. What are some specific strategies you might use to engage with others during a game?

User: I could initiate small talk, like asking someone if they want to team up. I could also compliment someone’s skills, which would be a good icebreaker.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Compliments and teamwork can really make connections easier. How do you feel about setting a goal for your next session?

User: I feel more confident about that. I want to commit to talking to at least one person during the sports activity.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Lin Feng! It's achievable and will help you gain confidence. Reflecting on our conversation today, what stands out to you?

User: I think I realized that my thoughts about embarrassment aren’t always accurate. I feel hopeful that I can improve my interactions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Recognizing those distorted thoughts is a big step towards feeling better. As we wrap up today, remember to practice those new thoughts and strategies in your next activity. What do you think is the next step for you after our session?

User: I’ll definitely think about what we discussed and remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect. I’ll look forward to the next sport activity.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! I'm proud of your progress, and I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges. If you find yourself struggling, remember that it's normal, and you can always talk it through. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! It helps to have this support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lin Feng! Remember, you’re not alone in this. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Participating in that outdoor activity helped a lot. I felt relaxed and even received some recognition from my peers, which was nice.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you felt relaxed and appreciated. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of that activity made you feel this way?

User: Well, I think just being outside and doing something active helped a lot. I also enjoyed being with my friends and feeling like part of the group. It made me feel more confident.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you were able to connect with your friends and enjoy the activity. Building those relationships can be very beneficial for your confidence. What do you think you could do to keep that positive feeling going?

User: Maybe I could try to participate in more outdoor activities or group events? I just don’t want to lose this momentum.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Lin Feng! Engaging in similar activities can help you maintain your confidence and improve your mood. Are there any specific activities you’re interested in trying out next?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a sports club or maybe a hiking group. I used to enjoy those kinds of things, but I wasn’t sure if I should get back into it. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! Joining a sports club or a hiking group could provide both physical activity and social interaction. What do you think might hold you back from pursuing these activities?

User: I guess I’m sometimes worried about being judged by others or not fitting in, but I also really want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way! Often, our mind can exaggerate those fears. Can we take a moment to explore what thoughts come to your mind when you imagine joining one of those groups?

User: I start thinking that maybe I’m not good enough to keep up with everyone else or that they won’t want me in the group.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Lin Feng. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit—what evidence do you have that supports these fears? Have you ever experienced someone being unwelcoming in such situations?

User: No, actually, thinking back, most people have been friendly and welcoming in past experiences. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like your past experiences contradict the worries you have now. How might you reframe those negative thoughts about joining a group based on your previous interactions?

User: I guess I could think that most people will be understanding and supportive, just like before. That feels a lot better!

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on that positive perspective can really help ease your anxiety about trying new things. As you think about joining a group, how can you remind yourself of those supportive experiences?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal and write down the positive experiences I have when I try new activities?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can help reinforce those positive memories and feelings, making it easier to face new challenges. How about setting a small goal for yourself regarding these activities?

User: I could aim to find a group and attend one session this month. That feels doable!

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! By setting a specific goal, you make it more achievable. How will you feel after you accomplish that?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself and more self-assured. It would be a step forward.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step can indeed boost your confidence. Let's also think about your family relationships—have they changed at all since we last met?

User: Yes, I feel like things are a bit better. I’ve been trying to communicate more openly with my parents, and they seem to be receptive.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Lin Feng! Open communication can significantly improve family dynamics. What strategies have you used to foster that communication?

User: I’ve just been more honest about how I feel, and I’ve tried to listen to their perspectives too. It feels nice.

Consultant: That’s a very mature approach! It’s great that you’re finding ways to connect with them. How does having a better relationship with your parents impact your overall mood and self-esteem?

User: I feel more supported and understood, which really helps me feel less anxious about everything.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Having a supportive family can make a significant difference in how you manage your feelings and challenges. Heading forward, how can you ensure that this positive relationship continues to grow?

User: I guess I could make it a point to check in with them regularly and keep sharing my thoughts. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Regular check-ins can help maintain that connection. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve accomplished during our sessions. How do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel really good about it. I’m starting to build my confidence and improve my relationships, which is huge for me!

Consultant: You’ve done an impressive job, Lin Feng! It’s important to acknowledge your progress. What strategies will you take away today to continue your journey toward personal growth?

User: I plan to participate in more activities, keep journaling, and maintain open communication with my family. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and build on your successes. Remember, if you ever feel the need for support again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful now about the future. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Take care, Lin Feng, and best of luck with your new activities and relationships.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Feng! It's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I’m quite satisfied with how things have improved with my family, and I feel more in control of my emotions. We even discussed my future plans, and I was able to express myself more openly.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing a positive shift in both your emotions and family dynamics. Can you share a bit more about that discussion on your future plans? What were some of the things you talked about?

User: We talked about what I want to study in high school and possible career paths. It felt good to share my thoughts, and my parents were supportive. I think I want to explore the arts, maybe graphic design or something creative.

Consultant: It's exciting that you've identified your interests! Creative fields can be very fulfilling. How did it feel to receive support from your parents while discussing these future plans?

User: It really boosted my confidence! I was so used to feeling misunderstood by them, so this change made me feel more secure and validated.

Consultant: That validation is very important and can help you build a solid foundation for the future. As we move forward, how do you feel about the emotional strategies you've been using to maintain this progress?

User: I've been trying to practice mindfulness and remind myself to focus on the positives. It’s not always easy, but it helps me when I start to feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Mindfulness and focusing on positive aspects are great strategies! When you feel overwhelmed, can you recall a specific instance where these strategies helped you alleviate those feelings?

User: Yes, there was one night when I felt really anxious about schoolwork. I took a moment to breathe deeply and thought about the things I’m grateful for, which helped me calm down.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! You’ve managed to intervene before the anxiety escalates. It’s about recognizing those feelings and taking steps to address them. Is there a moment recently where you might have felt anxious but remembered to use these strategies?

User: Yeah, just last week, I had a big assignment due. I was panicking about it and started thinking negatively like I wouldn’t finish on time. But then I remembered to breathe and focused on one step at a time.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement—a great example of using a positive cognitive strategy. Taking it step by step can make overwhelming tasks feel more manageable. As you continue on this path, are there any new goals you would like to establish concerning your academic journey or personal growth?

User: I want to maintain this positive mindset and also set a goal for my grades. I’d like to aim for at least a B average by the end of the semester. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal! Setting realistic targets like a B average can motivate you without overwhelming you. What actions do you think you’ll take to reach that goal?

User: I plan to create a study schedule that allows for breaks. I think balancing study time with leisure should help maintain my motivation.

Consultant: A study schedule with breaks can definitely help avoid burnout. How can we ensure that you stick to this schedule and adjust it if necessary?

User: Maybe I could use reminders or even involve a friend so we can hold each other accountable?

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Having a study buddy for accountability can make it more enjoyable and keep you motivated. As you create this schedule, feel free to factor in those accountability measures. 

User: I think involving a friend will definitely make it feel less lonely. I like that idea!

Consultant: Great! It’s nice to share learning experiences. In addition to academics, how do you feel about continuing to engage with your family regarding your future and studies?

User: I feel good about it! I think having an open line of communication with them helps a lot. I want to keep updates with my progress and plans, so they’re involved.

Consultant: Maintaining that connection with your family can provide additional support and encouragement. What steps can you take to keep them updated about your progress moving forward?

User: I can plan regular check-ins with them, maybe every few weeks to discuss how my studies are going and share my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy and proactive approach! Regular communication will benefit your emotional well-being and help them understand your journey. Is there anything you would like to express or any concerns you still have as we near the end of this session?

User: I feel like I'm on the right path, but I worry about slipping back into old habits if I face challenges.

Consultant: It's natural to have those concerns, especially when you've made such positive changes. Would you like to brainstorm some strategies we can add to your toolkit to help navigate those moments if they arise?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to ensure I don't revert to my old ways.

Consultant: One strategy could be to identify specific triggers that have previously led to negative feelings or behaviors. We can work together on developing coping mechanisms for when those triggers appear. 

User: That makes sense. If I can identify those triggers, I can prepare myself better to respond differently.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about building awareness and having a plan. How about we summarize what we’ve discussed today and outline the steps you want to take moving forward?

User: Sure! First, I’ll create a balanced study schedule, involve a friend for accountability, and keep open communication with my family about my progress.

Consultant: That’s a great summary! Remember that it's a journey, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. I'm optimistic about your progress. As we conclude today’s session, how do you feel about the direction you're heading in?

User: I feel really hopeful and energized about my goals. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Lin Feng. You’ve shown remarkable strength and resilience. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. I’m here whenever you need guidance. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
