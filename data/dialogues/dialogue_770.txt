Consultant: Hello, Feng! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing what’s been on your mind lately, particularly about the situation you encountered at school.

User: Hi. I really feel upset about what happened with my classmate. I lent him my biology answer booklet, and when I asked for it back, he just acted indifferent. It made me angry and frustrated, and when I confronted him, it only led to a bigger conflict. I don’t think the teacher handled it well either. It’s just so unfair.

Consultant: I can see how that situation would leave you feeling unfairly treated and frustrated. It's normal to feel upset when someone disregards your efforts. Can you tell me more about how you felt during that confrontation?

User: I felt really angry, but I didn’t express it outright. I just kept it inside because I didn’t want to escalate things further. But now I feel more hurt because I think my feelings didn’t matter to him or to the teacher.

Consultant: It's understandable that you’re feeling hurt and angry, especially since you kept those feelings bottled up. Holding onto those emotions can be quite heavy. Have you had other experiences like this in your interactions with classmates?

User: Yes, I often feel like I can't stand up for myself. There were times when classmates would tease me or ignore me, and I just let it happen. I feel like I can't change it, and now I’m just tired of feeling this way.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of frustration from these experiences. You mentioned feeling tired of how things are. What do you think this tiredness reflects for you?

User: I guess it shows that I'm really struggling. I want to have friends and get along with people, but it’s hard. I feel stuck and don’t know how to improve things.

Consultant: Feeling stuck can make it difficult to see a way forward. One thing I’d like to explore is how you view these social situations. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about interacting with your classmates?

User: I often think that they won't like me or that they’ll judge me. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not good enough to be part of their group.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very powerful and often lead to a cycle of feeling unworthy. Let’s take a moment to challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have that makes you feel you’re not good enough to be part of their group?

User: I don’t have any specific evidence, it’s just a feeling I’ve developed over time. I see how they interact so easily, and I can’t help but compare myself.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can be a common pitfall. It can make us overlook our own unique qualities. If you were to focus on the positive aspects of yourself, what do you think you would find?

User: Sometimes I think I’m good at studying and I’ve helped others with their work. But I just don’t think that will make them want to be friends with me.

Consultant: Helping others is indeed a valuable quality and one that can strengthen connections. What would it look like for you to reach out more, perhaps in light of your strengths, and engage with your classmates?

User: I guess I could try to join study groups or help them more frequently. But I'm really anxious about being rejected.

Consultant: Anxiety about rejection is completely understandable. Could we explore small steps you might take to gradually open up to interacting more, despite those feelings of anxiety?

User: Maybe I could start by saying hello or complimenting someone in class. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Small gestures can lead to meaningful connections. How might you feel after taking that first step?

User: I think it might feel good, but I'm also scared they won’t respond positively.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive about responses from others. However, positive steps often lead to unexpected outcomes. If a classmate doesn’t respond how you hope, how might you interpret that situation differently?

User: I suppose I could think that it’s not always personal and that people might be preoccupied. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective, Feng. Remember, interactions can be influenced by many factors outside of ourselves. How can you remind yourself of that when facing a situation that seems discouraging?

User: I could write it down or repeat it to myself to help calm my mind. 

Consultant: Writing it down can be a great way to process those feelings. As we reflect on this session, what do you feel you've learned about your feelings and the situation with your classmates?

User: I’ve understood that I shouldn’t carry feelings alone and that I can take small steps to engage. I also learned that my worth isn’t defined by their response. 

Consultant: What a powerful realization! Learning to express yourself and recognizing your worth is a significant move toward easing those feelings of frustration. 

User: It feels a bit comforting. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. As we wrap up today, let’s consider some strategies to help maintain this comfort and take those steps forward. 

User: I’ll try to implement the things we've discussed and keep track of my progress.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Remember, progress takes time, and each step you take is valid. I’ll be here to support you whenever you need. Until next time, Feng! 

User: Thank you, see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Feng! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?  

User: Hi. I've still been thinking about the issues with my classmates. I feel stuck and unsure about how to approach them.  

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling stuck with your classmates. It's normal to feel anxious about these social situations. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically has been bothering you?  

User: Well, I still feel the tension from what happened in class. I wish I could just ignore it, but it keeps bothering me, and I don’t know how to deal with it.  

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional load and trying to navigate a tough situation with your classmates. Let’s explore these feelings together. How do these experiences affect your daily life or how you interact with others?  

User: They make me more anxious in class, and I often feel overwhelmed. I don’t want to be around them, and it’s hard to focus on my studies.  

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Feng. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you think about interacting with them?  

User: I often think they will just judge or make fun of me again, so I just want to avoid them completely.  

Consultant: Avoiding situations that make us anxious can provide temporary relief, but it often reinforces those fears. Let’s try to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that they would judge or mock you again?  

User: I guess it’s mostly just my fear. They have mocked me before, but maybe it won’t happen again.  

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge that fear while also considering that not every interaction will lead to negative outcomes. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them about facing these fears?  

User: I’d probably tell them to try talking to the classmates instead of avoiding them. But I don’t know if I can do that myself.  

Consultant: That’s a wise suggestion. It sounds like you’re aware of the benefits of facing these fears, even if it feels difficult. What if we practiced some approaches together that you could use in these situations?  

User: That might help, but I’m still really nervous about actually doing it.  

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about new approaches. Let’s start with a simple practice. How about we role-play a scenario where you’d interact with your classmates? What situation would you like to practice first?  

User: Maybe just saying hi to them in the hallway. That seems simple enough.  

Consultant: Starting with a simple greeting is a great idea! Let’s pretend we’re in that hallway now. You walk by, and I’ll be one of your classmates. Go ahead and try saying hi.  

User: Okay. “Uh, hi!”  

Consultant: Good start! How did it feel to say that?  

User: It felt awkward, but not as bad as I thought it would.  

Consultant: That’s a positive revelation! Sometimes the anticipation of discomfort is worse than the reality. Now, would you like to add something to your greeting, like asking how they are?  

User: Sure, let’s try that. “Hi! How are you?”  

Consultant: Excellent! How did that feel?  

User: A bit more comfortable, actually. It’s nice to feel more engaged rather than just avoiding them.  

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Feng! Engaging like that can create little opportunities for connection. How can you build on this experience in the future?  

User: I think I could practice saying hi to them a bit more often.  

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular practice can help reinforce that new behavior. Let’s think about how you might feel if they respond positively.  

User: I guess I would feel relieved and maybe even happy that I tried.  

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling that relief can motivate you to keep trying. Now, let’s establish some next steps. What specific strategies can you use when you feel anxious again in these interactions?  

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and it’s okay to take small steps, like just saying hi.  

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Acknowledging your feelings and approaching them gradually can lead to a more positive experience. As we wrap up, how would you like to summarize what you’ve learned today?  

User: I think I’ve learned that facing my fears step by step can make it easier, and that practicing simple greetings can help me feel more connected to my classmates.  

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! It’s all about progress at your own pace. I believe you’re heading in the right direction. As a next step, can we plan to practice these strategies before our next session?  

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I’m still anxious, but I feel more hopeful now.  

Consultant: Wonderful to hear, Feng! Remember, taking these small steps can lead to significant changes over time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before then. I’m here to help you through this journey!  

User: Thanks. I appreciate it. See you next time!  

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, Feng. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Feng! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your attempts at social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been a bit anxious, to be honest. I tried reaching out to some classmates, but it didn't go as well as I hoped. I felt embarrassed and worried about how they viewed me.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like the recent attempts took a toll on your feelings. Can you share more about what happened during those interactions and how they made you feel?

User: Well, I invited a couple of classmates to join me for study sessions, but they seemed uninterested. I felt like I was bothering them, and that made me anxious about trying again.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Feeling rejected can be really tough. When that situation happened, what thoughts went through your mind? How did those thoughts affect your feelings?

User: I thought, “They don’t want to be around me,” which made me feel even more isolated. I guess it just reinforced my belief that I'm not good at socializing.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts created a negative cycle for you. Let's explore that thought, “They don’t want to be around me." What evidence do you have for that belief? Is there a possibility that it might not be completely true?

User: I mean, they didn’t seem very excited, but maybe they were just busy or distracted. I guess it could be my perception influencing how I see their reactions.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Feng! It’s valid to consider the context of their behavior. If a friend of yours was in a similar situation, how might you respond to them? What would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay, and that not everyone is going to react the same way. I would encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! Applying that same understanding to yourself is very helpful. What if we tried reframing your thought to something more balanced? Instead of thinking “They don't want to be around me,” you could think, “They were busy, and this doesn’t define my worth.” How does that feel to you?

User: That feels a bit lighter. I think it makes sense to not take their reactions so personally.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s think about some practical steps you can take moving forward. What are some social situations you might feel comfortable trying again, perhaps with a different perspective in mind?

User: Maybe I could start with smaller groups, like just one or two classmates for a casual hangout. It might feel less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Smaller groups can be more manageable. How about you set a specific time to reach out to someone? What would you say to initiate that?

User: I could just ask if they want to grab a coffee or study together sometime. That feels doable.

Consultant: Absolutely, that feels very approachable. Remember to keep your expectations flexible, and focus on enjoying the interaction rather than worrying about the outcome. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I like the idea of keeping it casual and friendly.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! With practice, these interactions can become easier. Let's also discuss the importance of reflecting on your experiences—after a social interaction, jot down how it went and what you learned. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. Having a record might make me feel more accomplished about any little success I have.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about acknowledging those small wins. As we move forward, try to celebrate every step you take in the right direction. Is there anything else you feel would help you during this process?

User: I think just having this plan makes me feel more confident. I would like to talk about handling situations if I face rejection again.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's wise to prepare for that as well. If you face rejection, remember to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone experiences rejection and it doesn't define your value. What strategies might you use to help yourself in those moments?

User: I could try telling myself it’s not the end of the world. I can also remind myself about the positive feedback I’ve received recently.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! It’s crucial to focus on the positives and to have self-reassuring thoughts handy. As we wrap up today, what are your main takeaways?

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and not to take social interactions too personally. I feel more eager to try again.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Feng! You’ve made significant progress today. Remember to keep practicing these skills and be gentle with yourself. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll give it my best shot.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in you and I’m excited about your journey ahead. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Feng! I’m glad to see you again. It sounds like you’ve had some positive experiences since our last session. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling a bit better. I attended a class event where I tried talking to some classmates, and I actually received some positive feedback. It felt nice, but I’m still struggling with the idea of continuing to put myself out there.

Consultant: That’s great to hear about the event and the positive feedback! It sounds like it was a valuable experience for you. What do you think contributed to that positive feedback? 

User: I think it was mainly that I tried to be more open and just enjoy the moment instead of overthinking everything. I didn’t feel as anxious as I usually do.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to recognize the benefits of being open in social situations. That's a huge step forward! What do you think could help you maintain that openness in future interactions?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that not every conversation has to be perfect. I could focus on enjoying the interaction rather than worrying about what to say next.

Consultant: That seems like a healthy perspective! If we think about the conversations you want to engage in moving forward, what specific situations might still make you feel anxious?

User: I think larger gatherings still make me a bit nervous. I often feel lost in those settings, and I worry about not knowing what to say.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way in larger groups. Let’s explore how you might navigate those situations. What might be a small step you could take to prepare for a larger gathering?

User: I guess I could practice some small talk topics in advance. Having a couple of things ready to say could ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Preparing topics sounds like a useful strategy! Would you like to brainstorm some potential topics together that you could use in those settings?

User: Sure! I could talk about recent movies or music. Those seem like safe subjects that many people enjoy discussing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Movies and music are great conversation starters. How do you feel about approaching a classmate with one of those topics in an upcoming gathering?

User: I think I could do that. It feels less intimidating than approaching someone without any plan.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! When you think about using that approach, what kind of feelings come up for you? 

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: Excitement is a good sign! It shows you’re willing to try. What can you do if that nervousness creeps in during the conversation?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. It’s part of putting myself out there, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that nervousness is normal can help ease the pressure. What other strategies do you think might help if a conversation doesn't go as planned?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and remind myself it’s just one conversation. It doesn’t define my whole social life.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Taking a deep breath can help center you in those moments. How do you see these new skills influencing your overall social experience?

User: I hope they will make me more comfortable in social situations. I want to keep improving and not feel so isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re on the right track towards feeling more comfortable. Recognizing your progress is important. What progress have you seen since our last session?

User: I’ve done more social interactions than I usually would. It feels good to have taken those steps.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Feng! Celebrating those steps is essential. How do you want to continue building on this momentum in the next few weeks?

User: I think I’ll aim to participate in more class activities and use the social strategies we discussed. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway from our session that you want to keep in mind as you continue this journey?

User: I think I want to remember that it’s okay to be nervous and that approaching people with a plan can help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s a valuable takeaway! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, Feng. Keep practicing those strategies, and you're likely to feel even more confident in social settings. If you ever feel like you need support, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Feng! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to reach out to my classmates more and talk to them. It's going okay, but sometimes I still feel a bit anxious when approaching people.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to connect with your classmates! That can be a big step. Let's talk about that anxiety—what kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you approach someone?

User: I often worry about what they might think of me. I fear they might laugh at me or not be interested in talking. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create anxiety. It sounds like you're concerned about their reactions. How do those worries make you feel in the moment when you try to start a conversation?

User: They make me really nervous. Sometimes I second-guess myself and end up not saying anything at all.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous, especially when dealing with uncertain outcomes. Reflecting on this, can you think of a time when you approached someone and it went better than you expected?

User: Well, I did talk to one guy in class about a project, and he seemed open to it. We actually ended up discussing it for quite a while.

Consultant: That's a wonderful example! It shows that sometimes, the outcome can be positive, even if our worries tell us otherwise. How did you feel during that conversation?

User: I felt relieved and a bit more confident afterward. It was nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: That relief and confidence are significant. It demonstrates you have the ability to engage. Let's explore ways to build on that positive experience. When you feel anxious next time, what thoughts could you remind yourself of to stay calm?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that not everyone will react negatively, and that some people actually enjoy talking about common interests.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on shared interests is a great way to ease anxiety in social settings. What specific interests do you think you could talk about with others?

User: I like playing games and watching movies. I could start a conversation about the latest game or movie.

Consultant: Those are perfect topics! They're relatable and can help spark conversations. How can you prepare yourself for approaching classmates about these interests?

User: I could think of a couple of questions or comments beforehand. Maybe share something interesting I read or saw.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Having some conversation starters can definitely ease the pressure. How do you feel about trying this approach in your next social situation?

User: I think I’m willing to try it out. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, taking small steps is key. After your next interaction, would you be willing to reflect on how it went, so we can discuss it together next time?

User: Yes, I can do that. I’m curious to see how things change.

Consultant: That sounds great! It's all about tracking your progress and adjusting as needed. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your efforts to connect with others now compared to when we started?

User: I feel more hopeful and confident that I can improve. This conversation has helped me see things differently.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Your willingness to engage and reflect on your experiences is a big step forward. Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel anxious, but with practice, you'll get more comfortable. I'm looking forward to our next session to hear all about your experiences!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it as well.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Feng! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I think I’ve been a bit better overall. My exam scores improved, and I feel somewhat more confident now. My mom has been very supportive, which really helped.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your mother's support has made a positive impact on your confidence. Can you tell me more about how your feelings have changed since our last session?

User: I used to feel really low and anxious about school, but now I think I can handle things a bit better. I still worry sometimes, especially during classes, but it’s not as overwhelming as before.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling less overwhelmed. You mentioned still having some worries during classes. Can you elaborate on what specific thoughts or situations cause you to feel anxious?

User: Well, I often worry about speaking up in class. I fear that I might say something wrong or that others will judge me. Even though I want to participate, I hesitate because of that fear.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, and I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like fear of judgment is holding you back. When you have those thoughts, what kind of emotions do you feel?

User: I usually feel a mix of anxiety and frustration. I want to engage, but my mind tells me that it’s safer to stay quiet.

Consultant: I understand how frustrating that can be. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. When you think about what others might say or think if you speak up, what evidence do you have that supports those fears? 

User: I guess it’s just how I feel. I remember some situations where I didn’t respond and felt embarrassed afterward. But I don’t know if it was as bad as I imagined.

Consultant: It sounds like those past experiences left a strong impression. However, it’s possible they may not reflect the reality of what might happen. Can we think of a time when you did speak up and things turned out well?

User: Actually, there was a time during a group project when I shared an idea, and the teacher praised it. That felt good, but it’s rare for me to feel that way.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You showed that your contributions can be valued. How can we help you replicate that feeling of confidence in future situations?

User: Maybe I could practice in smaller groups first before speaking up in class. That might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing in smaller, less intimidating settings could definitely help build your confidence. What other strategies do you think you could use to manage your anxiety before classes?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises before class or even remind myself of the positive feedback I received last time. 

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Deep breathing can help ground you, and recalling positive experiences can shift your mindset. How do you feel about putting this plan into action for your next class?

User: I feel hopeful about it. I think having a plan will make me less anxious. 

Consultant: It's fantastic to hear your optimism! Just remember that it’s a gradual process, and every small step counts. When we meet next time, we can discuss how the strategies worked for you and make any adjustments if needed.

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes.

Consultant: I’m excited to hear about your progress as well! Before we finish today, let’s summarize the strategies we discussed so you can refer back to them easily. 

User: Yes, let's do that!

Consultant: To summarize, we talked about practicing speaking in smaller groups, using deep breathing exercises before class, and recalling your past successes to boost confidence. Do you feel prepared to implement these strategies?

User: Definitely! I’ll write them down to remind myself.

Consultant: Excellent idea! This will help reinforce your commitment. I'm really proud of the progress you've made, Feng. Remember to be kind to yourself as you practice these new strategies.

User: Thank you! That really helps.

Consultant: As we wrap up today, I want to remind you that progress takes time, and you have shown a lot of strength in facing your challenges. If you ever feel stuck, don’t hesitate to reach out for support.

User: I appreciate that! I will keep it in mind.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. I believe in your ability to manage both your feelings and your connections with others. Until next time, take care, and I look forward to seeing you again!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful after our session today. See you next time!
