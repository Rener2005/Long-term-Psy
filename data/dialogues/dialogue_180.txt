Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you. Before we dive in, I'd like to hear about how you've been feeling lately. What's been going on?

User: Hi. I've just been feeling really low and bored. I can't seem to focus on anything, especially with school and the recent exam situation. It's like I'm stuck and don't know how to move forward.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially with the added pressure from school. When you say you're feeling stuck, can you describe what that feels like for you? What thoughts come to mind?

User: I keep thinking that I’m a failure because I didn't do well on my exams. It’s like I can’t escape this negative cycle of thoughts. I also worry about what others think of me, especially my friends.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way after facing challenges like you did. You mentioned feeling like a failure—do you remember the specific thoughts you had during the exam that made you feel that way?

User: I thought things like “I'll never catch up” or “Everyone else is doing better than me.” It’s hard to shake those thoughts, and they just keep replaying in my mind.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It seems like they could turn into a cycle that keeps you from feeling good about yourself. Have you noticed how those thoughts impact your mood or the way you approach your studies?

User: Definitely. Whenever I think like that, I just feel so anxious and lose motivation. I even avoid studying because it feels pointless when I'm not doing well.

Consultant: That’s a common response. Avoiding study can feel like a way to escape the pressure, but it might also be keeping you stuck in that negative cycle. What do you think would happen if you faced those thoughts directly instead of avoiding them?

User: I guess that I might realize they're not true or at least see things differently. But it’s scary to think about confronting them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel scared. It takes courage to challenge those ingrained beliefs. Let’s think about ways to ease into that. What if we tried looking at one of those thoughts and finding evidence for and against it? For example, the thought that “Everyone else is doing better than me”—can you think of a time when you felt proud of your work or a successful moment?

User: Well, there have been times when I received good grades in the past. But it feels like a long time ago now, and I don't remember it clearly.

Consultant: Those moments matter, and they show that you can succeed. It’s easy to overlook them during tough times. What if we wrote them down? Having reminders of your achievements could help challenge the idea that you’re not doing well at all.

User: That sounds helpful. Writing things down could help me see things more clearly, I think.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by listing a few achievements that make you feel proud. Focusing on these moments can serve as a reminder of your abilities. What are some from your past?

User: I did well in some subjects in middle school and even helped a few friends with their homework. I felt good about that.

Consultant: Those are wonderful accomplishments! Helping others reflects your understanding and capability. Now, how did you feel when you were helping your friends? 

User: I felt really good and confident, like I was actually useful to them.

Consultant: That sense of usefulness is important. It sounds like you have the ability to contribute positively, which is a core part of building connections with others. Have you had the chance to connect with classmates about your shared experiences or struggles lately?

User: Not really. I feel like they wouldn't understand what I'm going through. It's hard to open up about how I feel.

Consultant: It's common to feel hesitant to share. Many people face their own struggles, and you might find that some of them relate to what you’re going through. What if you tried to share a little bit, maybe just a small part, and see how they respond?

User: I could try that. Maybe starting with something simple wouldn’t feel too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Small steps can lead to bigger changes. Also, if you connect with someone and face difficulties, remind yourself of your past achievements as a confidence boost. 

User: I see how that could help. I’ll certainly give it a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we discussed. You’ve identified some negative thoughts and discussed ways to challenge them, plus glimpses of past pride through accomplishments and connection-building with classmates.

User: Yes, I think writing those good experiences will really help, and talking to my classmates might ease my loneliness.

Consultant: Absolutely! Just remember to be patient with yourself. It takes time to change thought patterns, and it’s okay to seek help along the way. If you ever feel stuck again, we can explore deeper into the issues together.

User: I appreciate that! Thank you for listening and helping me think differently about things.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you. If you need to discuss anything further or want to check in, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a great week ahead!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxue! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling kind of lonely and disconnected from my classmates lately. It seems like they don’t really understand what I'm going through, and it's been weighing on me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of isolation, and it can be really tough when you feel like your classmates aren't there for you. Can you tell me a little more about those feelings and any recent experiences that might have contributed to this?

User: Well, there have been some changes in my class dynamics. Some of my friends have started hanging out with different people, and I just feel left behind. I wish I could connect with them like I used to, but now I feel awkward around them.

Consultant: I hear you. Changes in friendships can be really challenging. Feeling awkward is totally normal when relationships shift. What do you think is the biggest barrier that’s preventing you from reconnecting with them?

User: I think it’s mostly my fear of rejection. I worry that if I reach out, they’ll just ignore me or think I'm trying too hard.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough situation. Your feelings of fear and worry are understandable. Let's explore that fear of rejection a bit more. When you think about reaching out to your classmates, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I keep thinking that they might find me annoying or that they won't care about what I have to say. It makes me hesitant to even try.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really hold you back. Let’s try to challenge them. Is there evidence that supports the idea that they would find you annoying? Have there been instances where they showed they do care about you?

User: I guess they have been friendly before, but I just can’t shake off this feeling of being an outsider now. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel like an outsider during these kinds of changes. Sometimes, our minds amplify our fears, making them seem more real than they actually are. What might happen if you tried to reach out to just one classmate and see how they respond?

User: I guess it wouldn't hurt to try. Maybe I could invite one of them to study together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea, Xiaoxue! Inviting someone to study could create a natural opportunity to interact. What would be a comfortable way for you to do that?

User: I could send a message to one of them. I think I know a couple who might be open to it.

Consultant: Perfect! Crafting a simple message could ease you into reaching out. How do you think you might phrase your invitation?

User: Maybe something like, "Hey, want to study together sometime?" It’s casual, and it feels like a low-pressure way to connect.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s straightforward and friendly. How do you feel about sending that message?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I think it could help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Those mixed feelings are completely natural. A little excitement can be a good sign that you’re open to change. What if you think about how great it would be to reconnect, rather than focusing only on the fear?

User: That's a good point. I'll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Excellent! After you send the message, I encourage you to reflect on the outcome, regardless of what happens. How do you envision it going?

User: I hope they say yes! But even if they don’t, I’ll at least know I tried.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Remember, taking that step is a victory in itself. What other social activities could you consider trying if this goes well?

User: Maybe joining a study group or participating in some school event could help.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Engaging in group activities can open up more opportunities for connections. Would you be willing to set a goal to try at least one new social activity this week?

User: Yes, I would! I’ll look into study groups and see what’s available.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By actively seeking out more social opportunities, you'll likely feel a stronger sense of belonging. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually! It helps to talk it out and get some ideas.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Recognizing your feelings and taking steps to connect can be very empowering. As you move forward, remember to celebrate those small victories, whether it’s sending a message or joining an activity.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your support. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Xiaoxue! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxue! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. You mentioned feeling a bit lighter lately and trying new activities. How has that been for you recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve started participating in some art activities at school, which has been a nice change. However, I still feel anxious about my studies sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like engaging in art has been a positive shift for you, but the academic pressure still lingers. Can you tell me more about those moments when you feel anxious about your studies?

User: When I think about my homework or upcoming exams, I get this overwhelming feeling that I won't perform well. It makes it hard to concentrate on anything else, even when I'm at the art activities.

Consultant: I understand that feeling well. It can be quite challenging when academic pressure affects your ability to enjoy other aspects of your life. What specific thoughts run through your mind during those anxious moments?

User: I often think that if I don’t get good grades, I’ll disappoint my parents. Sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough compared to my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a tough position to be in, worrying about disappointing your parents and comparing yourself to others. Let’s explore that thought—how much evidence do you have that not getting perfect grades would actually disappoint them? 

User: Well, I know they want me to do well, but I think they might be more understanding than I assume. It's just that I put a lot of pressure on myself.

Consultant: It seems like you have an understanding of your parents’ expectations but also recognize that your self-imposed pressure might be part of the issue. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about managing those thoughts?

User: I'd probably tell them to take a breather and remember that their worth isn’t tied to grades. Maybe I should try to think like that too.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoxue! Shifting that perspective can really help. Let’s come up with a few practical strategies to balance both your academic responsibilities and your art activities. What do you think would be a manageable way to start?

User: Perhaps I could set specific times for studying and then reward myself with some art time afterward? That way, I can still enjoy both.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing a schedule that includes breaks for your art might help alleviate some of the pressure while keeping you motivated. Can you think of a small goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: I think I could aim to finish at least two chapters of my book and then spend an hour painting afterward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, and it integrates both your studies and your passion for art. How would you feel about sharing your goal with someone, as a way to keep yourself accountable?

User: I could tell my friends about it or share it with my parents. They’ve been supportive after I started my art activities.

Consultant: Sharing your goal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can help foster that supportive environment. Have you had any recent conversations with your parents about how you feel?

User: Not really. I usually just talk about my grades with them, but I think they would be open to discussing how I feel about everything else.

Consultant: That’s a great observation. Expressing how you’ve been feeling about your art and overall well-being could strengthen your connection with them. How about discussing it with them during your next family time?

User: Yes, I think I’ll try that. It would be good to share my progress and feelings instead of focusing only on academic stuff.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging them in your interests can help them understand you better and feel more connected. What do you hope to achieve from that conversation?

User: I hope they'll be proud of my efforts in art and understand that I’m trying to balance everything. It would be nice to feel supported.

Consultant: That’s a very reasonable wish. Feeling validated in your efforts can really reinforce a positive mindset. How do you think you would feel after having that conversation?

User: I think I’d feel more at peace and maybe a bit lighter, like I’m not carrying everything alone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I believe this supportive environment will empower you. Let’s plan on following up on how that conversation goes next time we meet. 

User: Sure, I’ll update you on that! I’m feeling a bit more hopeful about opening up.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoxue! Remember, taking small steps can lead to bigger changes. You’re doing great by engaging in activities you enjoy while looking for ways to share your feelings. Is there anything else on your mind for today?

User: I think that’s about it for now. I’m excited to try these steps and see how I feel.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Let’s keep working on the balance between your academics and your interests. Take care, and see you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxue! I'm glad to see you in today's session. I understand there have been positive changes in your communication with your family. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! I feel really hopeful. Having more conversations with my parents during weekends has made me feel more supported emotionally. It’s nice to share things with them again.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful improvement! Sharing things with your family can create a stronger bond. Can you tell me more about the types of conversations you've been having with them?

User: Well, we talk about my schoolwork and some of my feelings. I shared how I’ve been feeling a bit lost and bored with my studies, and they seemed to listen.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re opening up about your feelings. What was it like for you to share those feelings with them?

User: Honestly, it felt good. I was nervous at first, but they didn’t judge me. It felt relieving to express my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a significant step! Feeling accepted can make a huge difference. How do you think this openness might influence your relationship with your parents moving forward?

User: I think it could really strengthen our relationship. I feel like I can talk to them about anything now, which is nice.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being able to communicate like that lays a solid foundation for mutual support. As we continue, would you like to focus on enhancing your communication skills even further? 

User: Yes, I would love to learn more about how to express myself better.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s practice some effective communication techniques. We can do a role-play where you simulate a conversation with your parents. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think it could help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a situation where you want to tell your parents about your feelings towards studying. What would you say first?

User: I probably would say something like, “I’ve been feeling unmotivated in school. I find it hard to study.”

Consultant: That’s a solid opening. It’s clear and honest. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I think they would want to help me or encourage me. They care about my education.

Consultant: Yes, that’s likely. Imagine their response, and now, how can you express your needs further after that initial opening?

User: Maybe I could say, “I’d appreciate any advice on how to get back on track. I feel stuck.”

Consultant: Excellent follow-up! You’re asking for support, which is a healthy way to engage in a conversation. What do you think your parents might say in response?

User: They might suggest some study techniques or even help me plan my time better.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember to reinforce their support by thanking them for their input. How would you feel about thanking them after a conversation like this?

User: I’d feel grateful! I think that would encourage more support from them in the future.

Consultant: Wonderful insight! Expressing gratitude can enhance your connection. Now, let's talk about some specific study techniques you might want to ask them about next time. What would come to mind?

User: I think asking about creating a schedule or how to stay focused could be helpful. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Planning and focus are key. As you prepare for your next conversation, keep practicing expressing your feelings and needs. How does that make you feel about future discussions with your parents?

User: I feel more confident about talking to them now. I really believe it will improve our relationship.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It sounds like you’re making significant strides toward strengthening your family ties. It’s essential to reflect on these moments. What have you learned about yourself through this process?

User: I've learned that I can communicate more openly than I thought, and it feels rewarding.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Keep building on that strength. Let's also think about how you can maintain this momentum. What new goals would you like to set for yourself moving forward in your studies?

User: I want to create a balanced study schedule, find more engaging ways to learn, and stay in touch with my feelings about school.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Balancing study and emotion is crucial. As you work on these objectives, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. 

User: I will, I promise!

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, this is all part of your growth journey. It’s been a pleasure to see your progress today. How are you feeling about today's session overall?

User: I feel positive. I’m excited to improve my communication and study habits!

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that! You’ve got a clear path ahead. Just remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance! I truly appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoxue! I look forward to our next session where we can continue to explore your progress. Keep up the great work, and take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hey Xiaoxue! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I've been working on my studies and trying to stay positive.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're making progress with your studies. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling in terms of motivation and excitement for learning?

User: I’ve regained some of my excitement for school. I’ve been able to focus better on my subjects, and it feels rewarding to see improvements.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re regaining your excitement! What do you think helped you to focus better and feel more engaged?

User: I think setting up a study routine has really helped. Also, I allowed myself to take short breaks when I felt overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart strategy! Taking breaks can be really beneficial for maintaining focus. Have there been any specific challenges that you faced while getting back into the groove of studying?

User: Sometimes I still find it hard to sit down for long hours. I get bored and my mind starts wandering.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. It’s understandable, especially with the pressure of studying. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that come up when you feel bored or distracted?

User: I often think that I won’t do well anyway, so why bother? It’s frustrating.

Consultant: That’s a strong thought, and it definitely could affect your motivation. Let's explore that thought a bit more—what evidence do you have that keeps you thinking that way?

User: I guess I just fear failing again. It’s been a real struggle since I moved to a regular class.

Consultant: It sounds like the fear of failure has had a significant impact on your mindset. If a friend were to tell you that same thought, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on what they can control and to try their best without worrying too much.

Consultant: That’s very wise advice! It’s great that you can view it from a different perspective. How might you apply that advice to your own situation?

User: Maybe I need to remind myself that I can only do my best. I shouldn’t focus so much on the outcome.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on your effort rather than the outcome can shift your perspective. What small steps can you take to practice this mindset when studying?

User: I could set daily goals and celebrate small achievements rather than worrying about the final results. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Celebrating small wins can boost your motivation and reinforce a positive mindset. What kind of goals would you like to start with?

User: I could start with completing specific assignments each day and review a little bit at a time. 

Consultant: That sounds manageable and very effective! With this approach, how do you think your feelings about studying will change?

User: I think it would feel less overwhelming and more achievable. I might even start to enjoy the process again.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the process is so important. Now, let’s talk about any potential challenges you might face with this new approach. What do you think could come up?

User: I might get distracted by my phone or other things going on around me.

Consultant: That’s a reasonable concern, but being aware of it is the first step! What strategies do you think you could put in place to minimize distractions?

User: I could put my phone in another room while I study, or use apps that limit my usage.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Removing distractions can help create a conducive study environment. How does it feel to have these plans in place?

User: It feels reassuring, like I have more control over how I study.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about taking charge of your learning. Before we wrap up, let's summarize what you've learned today. What do you feel are your key takeaways?

User: I learned that it’s okay to have fears, but I can manage them by focusing on my efforts and enjoying the learning process. I also have concrete strategies to minimize distractions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary, Xiaoxue! You’ve made significant progress and I'm proud of you. As you move forward, what long-term goals do you wish to set for yourself?

User: I’d like to keep working on my studies and aim for good grades while maintaining my mental health. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal. Balancing your academic success and mental well-being is crucial. Remember, it’s okay to reach out whenever you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! This session has really helped me organize my thoughts.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! This will be our last session for now, so remember to celebrate your progress and apply these strategies. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you so much for your help! I feel more confident moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I wish you all the best. Feel free to come back anytime you need guidance. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
