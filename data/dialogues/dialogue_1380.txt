Consultant: Hello, Qian! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, can you share how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your interactions with women?

User: Hi, thanks for having me. I've been feeling really anxious. Whenever I think about approaching or talking to women, my heart races, and I feel a sense of dread. It makes me worry about my social skills and whether I'll ever get better.

Consultant: It sounds like this anxiety is really affecting your daily life and social interactions. Let’s try to understand where this fear is coming from. Can you describe a specific situation where you felt anxious about talking to a woman?

User: Well, there was this instance during a group project where I had to work with a female classmate. I couldn't focus on the task at hand because I was just so nervous about interacting with her. I ended up avoiding conversations, which made me feel even worse.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like this experience really heightened your anxiety and led to avoidance, which can be quite frustrating. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind during that situation?

User: I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself or that she wouldn't want to talk to me. It felt like I was just going to mess everything up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very distressing. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of negative thinking that leads to avoidance. Let's explore this a bit more—do you think these thoughts are based on real evidence, or might they be exaggerations of the situation?

User: I guess they are exaggerations because I don’t really know what she thought of me. But I often jump to the worst-case scenario, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially if avoiding these situations has become a habit. If you were to think about a friend who felt this way, what would you suggest to them about those negative thoughts?

User: I would tell them to challenge their fears and not assume the worst. Maybe try to approach the person and see how the conversation goes.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Perhaps we can practice that approach as a way to challenge your fears. How about we brainstorm some situations where you might try to engage more with women and see how it goes?

User: That sounds helpful. Maybe just starting with casual discussions in class or group activities could be a good step.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's identify one or two small actions you can take in those situations. What could be a simple way for you to start a conversation with a classmate?

User: I could start by asking questions about the project or sharing my ideas during group discussions. That feels more manageable.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Qian! Let's also think about what you can say to reassure yourself before these interactions. What positive affirmation could you tell yourself before approaching someone?

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to be nervous and that I’ve prepared for this. Just being myself is enough.

Consultant: Perfect! Remembering that it’s okay to be nervous can help ease some of that pressure. As you practice these interactions, we can check in next time about how they went. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I feel like I can at least try this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue, let’s also explore ways to reflect on your experiences afterward. How will you gauge your feelings after engaging in these conversations?

User: I think I could note down what went well and how I felt afterward each time. It might help me see my progress.

Consultant: Great idea! Journaling about these experiences can provide valuable insights and help you recognize positive changes over time. Would you be willing to commit to trying this out for our next session?

User: Yes, I’m definitely willing to try keeping a journal. It feels like a good way to track my growth.

Consultant: Excellent! We can conclude today by summarizing what you've learned and the steps you’ll take. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made in understanding your fears and starting to manage them?

User: I feel more hopeful than I did at the beginning. I see that I can take small steps toward improving my interactions.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Qian! Remember, each small step counts, and you have the tools to build your confidence. For our next meeting, think about the interactions you’ve had and how you felt after them.

User: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Feel free to reach out if you need support before our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Qian! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about the issues we discussed. I tried to approach some female classmates, but I still feel really anxious about the thought of being rejected.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting yourself out there, which is a big step. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you think about approaching them?

User: I keep thinking they'll judge me harshly if I fail. That makes me hesitate and want to avoid the situation altogether.

Consultant: I understand those feelings can be really overwhelming. Let's explore that further. What evidence do you have that they would judge you negatively? 

User: Well, I don't have any direct evidence. It's just a fear I have based on my past experiences—I was always shy, especially with girls.

Consultant: It’s understandable that past experiences can shape our fears. Sometimes we tend to think the worst will happen even when there's no proof. How might you view those interactions differently?

User: I guess I could try to think that not everyone will react negatively, but it's hard to shake those fears.

Consultant: That’s a good realization. It can help to challenge those automatic thoughts with alternative ones. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to face rejection and that it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rejection is a normal part of social interactions. How could that perspective help you when you think about approaching someone?

User: It might make it easier to take risks if I remember that getting rejected isn’t the end of the world.

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let's consider practicing that in a safe way. Can you think of a small, manageable situation where you could practice talking to a female classmate?

User: Maybe I could just start with casual small talk, like asking about assignments or something related to class.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting low-stakes situations can help you build your confidence gradually. How would you feel about trying that this week?

User: I think I could give it a try. I feel slightly more confident just discussing this.

Consultant: That's a great start! Confidence often grows with practice. What specific situation do you think you might encounter?

User: I have a group project coming up. I could speak to one of the female classmates in my group.

Consultant: Perfect! That setting provides a natural opportunity. What kind of things do you think you might say to start the conversation?

User: Maybe something like, “Hey, how do you want to divide up the work for this project?”

Consultant: That’s a great opening! It’s straightforward and relevant. Let’s think about how you could handle response if she seems uninterested or busy.

User: I guess if she seems busy, I could say something like, “No worries! Just let me know when you’re free to chat.”

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping it light can help reduce pressure. Let’s build on that. How do you feel about the idea of approaching her now?

User: I feel a bit less anxious, actually. It helps to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s normal to feel some anxiety. It means you care about the outcome. Let’s also consider coping strategies for if you do feel anxious during the conversation.

User: I guess I could take a few deep breaths before speaking.

Consultant: Absolutely, that's a great technique. Deep breathing can help calm your nerves. How about reminders of positive outcomes you've had previously—can you think of any?

User: I remember once when I talked to a classmate, and it went quite well. She even thanked me for reaching out.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example! Keep reminding yourself of those positive experiences. It can counteract the negative expectations. 

User: Yes, that does make it easier to think about it positively.

Consultant: Great! As we wrap up today, let's talk about what you're taking away from this session. 

User: I feel more prepared to talk to my classmates, and I'm beginning to challenge my fearful thoughts more actively.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress, Qian! I’m proud of you for facing these challenges head-on. Remember, small steps will take you a long way.

User: Thank you! I'll definitely try to approach someone this week.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences next session. Keep practicing those skills, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. You're doing great! 

User: Thanks so much! See you next time.

Consultant: Take care, Qian! See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today, Qian. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to engage more in social activities, but I still feel anxious when I'm around female friends. I hope to figure out how to be less sensitive to their opinions.

Consultant: It's good to hear that you're actively participating in social activities. Let's delve into what happens when you're around female friends. Could you tell me what thoughts come to mind in those moments?

User: Well, I often worry that they are judging me or thinking negatively about me. It makes me hesitate to speak up.

Consultant: I see. So, your concern about being judged makes it hard for you to engage in conversations. How does that worry affect your emotions during these interactions?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes even embarrassed. I just want to blend in, but that fear holds me back.

Consultant: It sounds like that fear of judgment is really powerful for you. Can you think of a specific moment recently when you felt this way? What were you thinking and feeling at that time?

User: Just last week, I was at a club meeting, and I wanted to share an idea. But when I thought about how the women might react, I just froze and kept quiet.

Consultant: That must have been frustrating for you, especially since you wanted to participate. What specific thoughts were running through your mind when you felt frozen?

User: I thought, "What if they think I'm silly or not interesting enough?" That made me too scared to even try.

Consultant: Those thoughts certainly sound overwhelming. Let's examine them a bit closer. How true do you think those thoughts are? Is it possible that others may not judge you as harshly as you think?

User: I guess I don't really know for sure. It just feels like a certainty in my mind.

Consultant: That’s quite common—sometimes our thoughts create a sense of certainty about experiences that aren’t as clear-cut. Let’s challenge that certainty together. If a friend were in a similar situation, what advice would you give him?

User: I'd probably tell him to just speak up and that not everyone is judging all the time. 

Consultant: Exactly! So you have the ability to encourage a friend, but it can be harder to apply that to yourself. How can we reframe your thoughts in a way that treats you with the same kindness you’d extend to your friend?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their insecurities, and they might not even notice what I think they're judging.

Consultant: That's a wonderful reframe! By acknowledging that others have their own concerns, it can help lessen the pressure you feel. What would it look like for you to put this new perspective into practice during your next interaction with a female friend?

User: I think I could try to focus on the conversation and remind myself of those reframed thoughts. I could even prepare some topics to discuss to ease my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Preparing topics can definitely help create a smoother interaction. How about we set a specific social goal for your next meeting? What would you like to achieve?

User: Maybe I could aim to share at least one of my ideas and not worry too much about their reactions.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Sharing your idea, regardless of the reaction, is a positive step. How do you plan to celebrate this achievement, no matter the outcome?

User: I suppose I could reward myself with a treat afterward, just to acknowledge that I took the step.

Consultant: Celebrating your efforts, no matter the outcome, is very important! It reinforces positive behavior. How does it feel to set this goal and have a plan to celebrate?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I think I can do it!

Consultant: That confidence is key! Remember, each action you take is a step toward strengthening your social skills. Let's check in on your feelings about being around women. How do you feel right now about these interactions?

User: I feel more hopeful, like maybe I can handle it better than before.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress, Qian! As we move forward, let's continue building on this achievement. We can explore more techniques for managing anxiety. Would you be open to some role-play exercises next time to practice social interactions?

User: Yes, that could be helpful! 

Consultant: Great! I look forward to working on that with you. Before we end today, is there anything else on your mind you’d like to discuss?

User: I think I'm good for now. Thank you for helping me think about these things.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Just remember, progress takes time, and I’m here to support you along the way. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Qian! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your interactions in the study group?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good actually. I’ve started to engage more with the group, and I even contributed some ideas in discussions. But I still feel a bit nervous when talking to the women in the group.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive development! It's natural to feel a bit nervous when interacting with women, especially with your background. What specific thoughts or feelings come to you when you start to feel nervous?

User: I think it’s mostly fear of saying something wrong or not being interesting enough. Sometimes I just worry that they won't want to talk to me.

Consultant: I completely understand that concern. It’s common to fear rejection or feel like we’re not good enough. Can you identify any specific moments in your conversations with them where this anxiety is heightened?

User: Yes, like when I’m about to speak up in a discussion. I feel my heart racing, and I often hesitate before I say anything.

Consultant: That’s a clear sign of anxiety. It sounds like your body is reacting to the situation. Have you noticed any patterns in those moments—like certain thoughts that come to mind or feelings that you experience?

User: I usually think, “What if they find my opinion silly?” or “What if they don’t respond positively?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound challenging to deal with. Let’s try to reframe them. What if instead of thinking that they might find your opinion silly, you considered that they might find it interesting? How does that shift in thinking feel?

User: That feels a bit better! I guess I hadn’t thought of it that way. 

Consultant: It's great to acknowledge that shift! It shows that these negative thoughts may not be completely accurate. When you think positively, it can help lessen the anxiety. We can practice this skill further. Would you like to try a role-play situation where you share an opinion in a discussion?

User: Sure! I think that might help. 

Consultant: Great! Imagine we’re in your study group, and there’s a discussion about a book you all just read. You have an opinion to share. How would you approach that?

User: I’d probably start with, “I found the character’s development really interesting because...” 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! Now, let’s emphasize this—how can you ensure your delivery feels confident? What could you tell yourself right before you share?

User: Maybe I could say, “I have a valid perspective, and it’s okay if they don’t agree.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful affirmation. Now, if you find yourself hesitating, can you recall that mindset? 

User: Yes, I think I can remember that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s discuss how you can apply this strategy next time you’re in the group. Do you have any upcoming sessions where you can implement what we’ve discussed?

User: Yes, I have a session next week. I’ll definitely try to use this positive mindset when I speak up.

Consultant: I’m excited for you! Remember, it’s perfectly fine to feel a bit uncertain—just to acknowledge that you’re trying is a significant step. After your session, how do you plan to evaluate how it went?

User: I think I’ll assess how I felt before and after speaking up, and see if I can notice any differences in my anxiety level.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s vital to reflect on your experiences. And if any negative thoughts pop up, you can remind yourself of our exercise today. You’re doing remarkable work, Qian. 

User: Thanks! I feel more confident now in handling these thoughts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think the most important thing is shifting my mindset and believing that my input is valuable.

Consultant: Absolutely! And as you move forward, keep practicing this new way of thinking. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to my next group session with this new attitude.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Qian. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you can always return here whenever you need support. Take care, and see you next time!

User: See you! Thank you again!

Consultant: Hello Qian, I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling about your interest in romantic relationships since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of excitement and uncertainty. After those successful social experiences, I realize I want to explore a romantic relationship, but I also feel unsure about how to navigate it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing both enthusiasm and some apprehension about these new feelings. That's completely normal. Can you share a bit about what specifically excites you and what makes you feel uncertain?

User: I'm excited because I’ve never really thought about dating seriously before. I want to understand what it’s like to connect with someone on that level. But I also worry about what I should offer in a relationship and if I can truly connect with someone.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing your excitement about exploring romantic connections. As for your concerns, it’s important to understand that relationships are about mutual exchange. Let's explore what you feel you can offer and what you might need from a partner. 

User: I think I can offer support and perhaps some fun experiences, but I’m worried I might not know how to communicate well. It’s hard for me to express what I really feel sometimes.

Consultant: It’s very insightful of you to identify both the support and fun you can bring into a relationship. And it's common to feel challenged by communication. What are some situations where you found expressing your feelings to be particularly difficult?

User: Well, during group projects at school, I often hesitate to share my thoughts, fearing that they might not be valuable or that others will disagree with me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Fear of judgment can hold us back from expressing ourselves. This could affect how you approach a romantic relationship too. Let’s think about ways you might practice sharing your thoughts in a more comfortable setting. How do you think you can start doing that?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my thoughts with close friends first. I feel more comfortable with them, and their feedback could help me.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Practicing with friends could build your confidence in expressing yourself. What specific topics do you feel ready to discuss with them?

User: I think I could share my views on a movie we recently watched together. It’s a safe topic, and I often feel strongly about films.

Consultant: Movies are a great topic! Discussing your opinions can help you practice expressing your feelings and thoughts. After sharing, reflect on how it felt. Did you notice any positive responses or encouragement that you received?

User: I think my friends usually respond positively. They ask me questions and seem to be interested in what I say. That feels nice.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a great indicator! Their interest shows that your thoughts matter. Recognizing those positive exchanges can motivate you to express yourself more. How might you apply this practice to expressing your feelings when it comes to dating?

User: I suppose I could start by being open about my interests or things I enjoy with someone I’m interested in. It feels more natural to share things about myself that I’m passionate about.

Consultant: Absolutely, sharing your passions can be a wonderful way to connect with someone! It also allows for a deeper conversation. What kind of interests or passions do you think you’d be excited to share with a potential partner?

User: I really enjoy playing video games and discussing interesting movies. I’d love to meet someone who shares those interests.

Consultant: Those are fantastic conversation starters! Engaging in shared interests can foster a connection. How do you feel about initiating a conversation about these topics with someone you're interested in?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also think it would be exciting. I could ask if they have seen any good movies or played any new games. That could spark a conversation.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Asking open-ended questions helps keep the conversation flowing. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous; what’s important is taking those steps forward. How do you foresee handling your nervousness if it arises during these conversations?

User: I could practice some breathing techniques I’ve learned to calm myself down before starting a conversation. That might help me feel more centered.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Breathing techniques can be very effective for managing anxiety. Let’s also reflect on what you hope to learn from these interactions as you explore romantic relationships. What do you think is important for you to discover?

User: I want to discover if I can be vulnerable with someone and if they can accept me for who I am. I think that will be crucial for me.

Consultant: Vulnerability is indeed key in developing deep connections. Being open about your feelings and experiences is essential. How can you prepare yourself to be open while still maintaining a sense of safety in those interactions?

User: I guess I can take it slow. I don’t have to share everything at once. I can gauge the other person’s response and decide how much to share based on that.

Consultant: That's a wise approach! Gradually sharing helps build trust over time. Remember, relationships are about mutual comfort. As you reflect on our conversation today, how would you summarize the key takeaways regarding your confidence in dating?

User: I feel more prepared to express my interests, approach conversations with potential partners, and manage my nervousness. I realize that I have much to offer and I can take my time.

Consultant: It sounds like you've made significant progress in understanding your feelings and approach to relationships. Remember to celebrate these small victories! Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any concerns you want to address?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I feel more confident and clear about what I want to do. Thank you for helping me clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Qian! I’m proud of your progress today. Keep practicing those communication skills and reaching out. If you have any questions or need support, don't hesitate to return. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qian! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I've made some progress in my communication with women. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're noticing some positive changes in your social skills. Can you share a bit more about what you've experienced recently?

User: Well, I recently had a couple of conversations with some female classmates. I was able to listen actively and engage in meaningful discussions. It felt good to connect with them.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Qian! Active listening is such an important skill in building relationships. How did you feel during those conversations?

User: I felt nervous at first, but as the conversations went on, my nerves eased. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the back-and-forth.

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous initially, but it’s wonderful that you found enjoyment in those interactions. What specific skills or strategies do you think helped you during those conversations?

User: I think focusing on what they were saying and asking follow-up questions helped a lot. It made the discussion flow more naturally.

Consultant: Excellent! Engaging with follow-up questions shows that you're genuinely interested, which can really enhance connections. Are there any challenges you faced during these interactions?

User: I did feel a bit overwhelmed at points, especially when I wasn’t sure how to respond. I worried about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Would you say those thoughts of saying the wrong thing influenced your confidence in the moment?

User: Yes, definitely. Sometimes I would second-guess myself and hesitate before replying.

Consultant: That makes sense. Let's explore those worries a bit. What evidence do you have that saying the wrong thing would lead to a negative outcome?

User: I guess there isn’t really any concrete evidence. I just fear rejection or making a fool of myself.

Consultant: It’s common to have those fears, but it’s important to challenge that thinking. If you were to give advice to a friend who feels the same way, what would you say?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s a part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! Mistakes are part of the process. By reframing your thoughts in that way, you can ease some of your anxiety. Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, it does. It’s good to remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Now, looking at your progress, what do you feel is your biggest achievement in these social interactions?

User: I think just being able to start conversations and keep them going is a big deal for me.

Consultant: That’s a huge step! Keeping conversations going shows that you’re building a connection. Where do you see yourself going from here? Any specific areas you want to improve?

User: I want to feel even more comfortable and maybe explore how to approach women in different settings, like social gatherings.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! It’s wonderful that you want to expand your comfort zone. How do you think you can prepare for those situations?

User: Maybe I could practice some openers or topics in advance. It might help me feel less anxious when the time comes.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Preparing in advance can give you more confidence. Would you be open to trying out some scenarios together in our next session?

User: Yes, I would like that! Role-playing might help me get used to different situations.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ll create some scenarios to practice in our next session. For now, keep reinforcing the positive changes you've made. How do you feel about your journey so far?

User: I feel proud. I was worried I wouldn’t improve, but I’ve surprised myself.

Consultant: You should be proud, Qian! Remember, self-reflection is key. As we wrap up today, do you have any thoughts on how you can maintain this focus moving forward?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing and remind myself that it’s a process. I won’t pressure myself too much.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Taking it step by step will help you continue to grow. Thank you for sharing with me today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. Looking forward to our next session!
