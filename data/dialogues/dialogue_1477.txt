Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hui. It’s great to see you again. Before we begin, I want to know how you've been feeling since our last session.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed. There was a fight in class recently, and now it feels like everyone is against me. I feel so isolated and unhappy.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that conflict has intensified your feelings of loneliness and disappointment. Can you tell me more about what happened in class and how it affected you?

User: Well, it started with a small argument over group work, and it just escalated. Some classmates started whispering and excluding me. It felt like I was invisible.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, feeling invisible among your peers. When this happened, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I'm just not likable, or that I deserve to be treated this way. It’s like I always mess things up.

Consultant: I can understand how those thoughts can be overwhelming and reinforce negative feelings about yourself. Let’s explore those thoughts together. When you think, "I’m not likable," how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really sad and angry at myself. I just wish I could be like everyone else and not feel so alone.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel sad and frustrated when you’re comparing yourself to others. Have you noticed any specific situations where you've felt you weren’t worthy or liked by your classmates?

User: Mostly in social events and during group activities. I often feel like I’m the odd one out, and I keep thinking maybe it's because I’m just not good enough.

Consultant: Those feelings can be heavy to carry. Let’s look at that thought more closely—what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough? Are there moments that contradict that belief?

User: Sometimes, my teacher says I did a good job on my projects, and a few classmates have been nice to me. But it’s hard to hold on to those moments when I feel so rejected by others.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize those positive moments, even if they feel overshadowed. Let’s challenge that core thought—what would you tell a friend who feels they aren't good enough when they've experienced something similar?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and that it’s okay to be different. Maybe I should try to remind myself of that too.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Let’s work on some positive affirmations that you can tell yourself. How about starting with, "I am unique, and I have qualities that make me valuable"? What do you think?

User: I think that could help. It sounds better than what I usually tell myself.

Consultant: Absolutely. It's all about rewriting that inner dialogue to be more supportive. How about we practice that? Next time you notice negative thoughts about yourself, try to reframe them into something positive.

User: I’ll give it a try. But I worry it won’t work. What if I still feel lonely?

Consultant: It’s okay to have concerns. Change takes time, and feelings of loneliness won’t disappear overnight. We can also think about ways to engage more with others. What activities do you enjoy that could help you connect with classmates?

User: I enjoy art and music, but I don’t know anyone who shares those interests. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful interests! Perhaps you could suggest an art project to your classmates or see if there's a music group you could join. Connecting over shared interests might help break the ice. 

User: That sounds like a good idea! Maybe I could be brave and reach out to someone.

Consultant: Absolutely, being brave can lead to wonderful opportunities. And remember, it’s perfectly fine to take small steps. How would you feel about setting a small goal to reach out this week?

User: I think I could try to talk to a classmate about music. It makes me a little nervous, but I want to try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Xiao Hui! Embracing that nervousness shows courage. After you try it, we can discuss how it went. What do you think?

User: Yeah, I’d like that. I hope I don’t mess it up. 

Consultant: It’s natural to worry, but even if it doesn’t go as planned, you’ll have learned something valuable. Remember, each experience is part of growing. 

User: That’s true. I need to remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! We all make mistakes, and it doesn’t define who we are. You're working on recognizing your worth and building connections, which is a significant step. 

User: Thank you for reminding me. I feel a little hopeful about trying to connect with others.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Hui. We’ve made great progress today. Let's keep practicing those positive thoughts and actions! What are your thoughts on next steps after today?

User: I will try my best to reach out to someone and remember to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe in you, and I can’t wait to hear about your experience next time. If feelings become overwhelming, remember you can always reach out for support. 

User: Thank you. This session has helped. I appreciate the encouragement.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Let’s touch base again soon to see how things have progressed. Take care until then!

User: Bye! I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohui! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi. I feel really overwhelmed. I just dread going back to the dorm on weekends. It’s frustrating because I thought it would get better by now.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still struggling with the idea of staying in the dorm. I appreciate you sharing this with me. What specific feelings or thoughts do you have when you think about returning?

User: I just feel really anxious and trapped. I keep thinking that I'll just be lonely and uncomfortable. It’s hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like the loneliness and discomfort are weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about those feelings? What thoughts come to you in those moments?

User: I think about how I'm not fitting in with everyone. I feel like no one wants to talk to me or include me. It's like I'm invisible.

Consultant: Feeling invisible is a heavy burden to carry. It makes sense that you'd feel anxious about returning. Have you noticed any particular moments when these thoughts are especially strong?

User: Usually, it’s when everyone is hanging out together, and I’m just sitting there alone. I can’t help but feel like I don't belong.

Consultant: That sounds really isolating. When you're sitting there alone, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I think maybe I’m just not good enough for them, or that I’ll never fit in. It makes me want to just avoid everything.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful and discouraging. Let’s take a moment to challenge those feelings. Do you think there might be evidence supporting the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I don’t know, but I just feel it so strongly. Sometimes I think maybe I’m just too different from them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel different, but let’s consider: if a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to be different and that everyone has their own struggles.

Consultant: Exactly! So, if we apply that same kindness to yourself, how might that change your perspective on fitting in with your peers? 

User: Maybe I should acknowledge that it’s okay to be different and that my feelings, while hard, are valid too. 

Consultant: That's a great realization, Xiaohui! Validating your feelings is an important step. Now, how do you think you might start to address this avoidance you mentioned? 

User: I could try to talk to someone in my dorm, maybe start small by just saying hi or asking about their weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive strategy! Engaging in small conversations can help you feel more connected. Would you like to brainstorm some other ways to feel more supported?

User: I think it would help to talk to someone who understands what I'm going through. Maybe I could find a group or club, but I'm still scared.

Consultant: Joining a group can be daunting, but it can also build connections. How might you ease that fear? 

User: Maybe I could go to a meeting just to observe first, without any pressure to participate. 

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach. It allows you to feel the environment and gradually get comfortable. What other support systems do you think might be beneficial for you?

User: I wish I could talk to my dad more about how I feel. But I feel like he wouldn’t understand.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those worries. However, what if you shared just a small part of your feelings with him? 

User: I could try. He might surprise me, and maybe he could help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Opening that line of communication with your dad could be a great step forward. Do you think you’d be ready to try that?

User: I do want to try talking to him, but I still feel anxious about it.

Consultant: And that’s perfectly okay. It’s normal to feel anxious when considering sharing personal feelings. How can we prepare for that conversation to make it easier?

User: I could write down what I want to say. It might help to organize my thoughts.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing it out can help reduce anxiety and clarify your feelings. What do you think you'll write about first? 

User: I think I’ll start with how I’ve been struggling with fitting in at school and how living in the dorm has been tough.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach. It’s honest and straightforward. And remember, your feelings are important. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a little lighter, honestly. Talking about these things helps me see different possibilities and ways to cope.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaohui! You’ve taken some important steps today. As we wrap up, what are the main takeaways you’d like to focus on as we move forward?

User: I want to focus on reaching out more, not just to my dad but maybe also to my peers—taking little steps to connect with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember to be patient with yourself. If you need to talk more or need guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you. I actually feel more hopeful now, and I will try the strategies we talked about.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaohui! I believe in you, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaohui! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really down, especially after that argument with my dad. I just felt like there’s no support at home.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that, Xiaohui. It sounds like that argument was really tough on you. Can you tell me more about how it made you feel and what led up to it?

User: Well, I was trying to talk to him about school, but he just kept saying I needed to work harder. I felt frustrated and like he doesn’t understand me at all.

Consultant: It sounds like you were hoping for a more understanding and supportive response from your dad. When he didn’t acknowledge your feelings, it added to your frustration, right?

User: Exactly! I just want him to listen and understand what I'm going through.

Consultant: That’s a very valid need, Xiaohui. It’s important to feel heard, especially by family. Have you thought about how you might express this need to him differently?

User: I'm not sure. I guess I could write him a note, but I worry he’ll just dismiss it.

Consultant: Writing a note can be a good start! It allows you to express your feelings without the immediate reaction that might happen in conversation. How do you think your dad might respond to a letter?

User: Maybe he’d take time to think about it. But I still feel like it'll be hard to get him to actually listen.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Creating an environment that encourages open communication can help. What if you also included in the note a request for a time to talk when he feels ready? 

User: That might work. It would give him time to think. I just wish he'd want to talk.

Consultant: Building that connection can be tough, but it sounds like you're willing to put in the effort, which is a great step forward. What specific feelings do you want to share with him in the note?

User: I want him to know that I feel lonely and overwhelmed. I need him to understand that his support would mean a lot to me.

Consultant: Expressing those feelings is a courageous step. You could start with that in your letter, explaining how his support matters to you. Would you feel comfortable doing that?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. It feels good to think about it.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Xiaohui! Building these communication skills can help you feel more confident. How about we also discuss some ways to cope with those feelings of loneliness you mentioned?

User: I’d like that. Sometimes I feel so isolated, especially at school.

Consultant: Isolation can be really tough, especially during such a challenging time. Are there specific situations at school that make you feel more lonely?

User: Well, I often sit alone at lunch, and I feel like I don’t have any real friends there. It’s hard to start conversations.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a tough social environment. Starting conversations can be intimidating. Have you thought about small steps you could take to connect with someone?

User: I’ve thought about saying hi to a classmate I sometimes see, but I just freeze up.

Consultant: That's a common feeling! Starting small can help ease you into it. Maybe try smiling or making eye contact first. How would that feel for you?

User: That sounds easier. I could try smiling. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! It could open the door for a simple greeting or conversation. Let’s also think about what you could say if the opportunity arises. What might you say to start a conversation?

User: Maybe I could mention something about our homework or classes. 

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You can relate a shared experience, which can help break the ice. How do you feel about trying this in the upcoming week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. It’s nice to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for being willing to try! Remember, it’s okay to feel a little nervous. Every little step you take is progress. After you try this week, we can talk about how it went and what you felt.

User: That would be great! I hope I can feel more confident after.

Consultant: Confidence takes time, but you’re on the right track. We’re building your skills together. How about we also plan some ways to handle any feelings of disappointment or anxiety afterward if things don’t go as you hoped?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I often don’t know how to deal with those feelings.

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is important. We could discuss some coping strategies, like deep breathing or journaling about your experiences. Which of those sounds appealing to you?

User: I like the idea of journaling. I can get my thoughts out on paper.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic way to process your emotions and experiences. It lets you express yourself freely. We can create a space for you to write about your feelings after trying to connect with your classmates. 

User: That seems doable. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaohui! It sounds like you’re taking significant steps toward improving your communication and social skills. Over time, you might find that these strategies help not just at home, but also in school. 

User: That makes sense. Thank you for your help. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you through this process. Remember, progress may be slow, but every effort counts. It’s been great talking to you today, and I look forward to hearing how your week goes. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate it. I’ll focus on my plan this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaohui. I'll see you next time, and we can discuss your experiences and what worked for you. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohui! I’m so glad to see you here today. I remember last time we talked about trying new roles in your club activities. How are you feeling about that experience now?

User: Hi! I felt a bit nervous at first, but I really enjoyed the project I was involved in. It was nice to see the group working together, and I felt included for the first time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like being part of the group was a positive experience for you. What aspects of the group interaction did you find most enjoyable?

User: I liked how we all contributed ideas and supported each other. It felt nice to be around people who were friendly and working towards a common goal.

Consultant: That's great! Collaborating with others can truly enhance our sense of belonging. Do you think this experience has changed how you view social situations?

User: Yes, a little. I usually feel anxious and out of place, but this time, I felt like I could share my thoughts without being judged. It made me think I could try more activities like this.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Xiaohui. Acknowledging that sense of acceptance is a big step forward. What other social situations are you considering trying out?

User: I don’t know yet, but I’d like to join another club or maybe participate in school events. I just hope I don’t feel too anxious again.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about trying something new. Let’s explore that feeling. What do you think is the worst that could happen if you join another club or activity?

User: I guess I'm scared that I won't fit in or that people won't want to talk to me, like in the past.

Consultant: That fear is quite common, but let’s challenge that thought a bit. Last time, you felt included and appreciated, right? Is it possible that this new experience could also be positive?

User: I suppose it could be. It just makes me nervous thinking about it, given my past experiences.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel nervous, but remember that you’ve already had a good experience recently. Maybe we could try to build on that confidence. If you were to attend an event, what might be a good first step for you?

User: Maybe just attending and observing without having to talk too much at first? That might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: I think that sounds like a fantastic strategy! Observing first can help ease the anxiety of jumping straight into interaction. How would it feel for you to set that as a goal for your next event?

User: It feels manageable. I could try that and see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! And if you find it helpful, we can discuss ways to gradually engage more in conversations. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. But I might still feel stuck sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s okay; feeling stuck can happen to anyone. In those moments, how can you remind yourself of the positive experiences you've had recently?

User: I could think about how I felt during the project, that I did contribute and was heard.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Reflecting on your positive contributions can help shift your focus back to what you can achieve. Is there a specific thought or phrase that could support you when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe something like "I can be myself, and it's okay to be nervous."

Consultant: That's a powerful mantra! It's affirming and gentle, just what you need in those moments. How about we write that down so you have it to remind yourself?

User: Yes, I’d like that! 

Consultant: Great! I’ll help you keep it at hand. Moving forward, would you like to plan some actions or activities that could enrich your social life?

User: I’d love to! Maybe I could look for more creative clubs because I enjoy those activities.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiaohui! Engaging in creative clubs can provide you the opportunity to connect with others over shared interests—definitely a great way to build relationships. 

User: Yes, and I think that could help me feel more comfortable. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Plus, it allows for natural interactions as you all share a common interest. How about looking for a specific club this week?

User: I can do that! I’ll ask around to find some options.

Consultant: Awesome! When you find one, we can talk about how to approach it and what to expect. And remember, it’s completely fine to take it slow.

User: Thank you! That makes me feel better knowing I can take my time.

Consultant: Of course! It's about building confidence at your own pace. Before our next session, make sure to jot down your thoughts and feelings about the experience—this will help us reflect back on it.

User: I will! Thank you for all your support today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohui. I’m proud of the progress you’re making. I can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohui! I'm really glad to see you today. You mentioned that you've started participating in new activities lately. How has that experience been for you?

User: Hi. It's been surprisingly fun! I’ve found some activities that I really enjoy, but I also feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes because of schoolwork and everything else.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've found some enjoyment in new activities! Balancing schoolwork and leisure can indeed feel overwhelming. Can you share a bit more about which activities you enjoy and how they affect your mood?

User: I've been attending a painting class, and it makes me feel relaxed. I can express myself, and I forget about my worries for a while. But then, when I get back to school tasks, it feels like everything is piling up again.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful outlet for you to express your emotions. It's normal to feel a shift in mood when transitioning between enjoyable activities and responsibilities. How do you generally feel when you are engaged in painting compared to when you are working on school tasks?

User: When I'm painting, I feel happy and free. But when I'm doing schoolwork, I feel stressed and trapped. It's like I can't enjoy anything because of all the pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like painting allows you to momentarily escape the pressures of your schoolwork, which is quite healthy. This contrast can be difficult. Would you be open to finding ways to incorporate more of that relaxed feeling from painting into your study routine?

User: Yes, I’d like that! But I don't know how to do it. Sometimes I feel like I should only focus on studying and not waste time on other things.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with school pressures. However, integrating enjoyable activities, like painting, can actually improve your focus and effectiveness in studying. How about we explore some ideas on how you could combine your studies with enjoyable breaks?

User: That could help. What kind of ideas do you have in mind?

Consultant: One approach could be to use painting as a reward after completing study milestones. For instance, after finishing a chapter or an assignment, you could allow yourself some time to paint. This way, you pair the two activities and create a positive association.

User: That sounds good. I can look forward to painting after studying, so it doesn't feel so exhausting.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating those positive experiences that help balance the challenges of school. Additionally, would you consider setting aside specific times during the week dedicated solely to painting? This could give you something to look forward to.

User: I’d like to try that! It’s nice to think I’d have time strictly for painting.

Consultant: Fantastic! Setting those dedicated times can help you maintain that joyful feeling and also provide a break from academic stress. How do you see this working for yourself?

User: Maybe I could set Sundays for painting? That way, it feels like a special treat after a busy week.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Having Sundays for painting can be a great way to recharge. Let's also think about how you'll remind yourself to value this time, even when school gets busy. What strategies could work for you?

User: I guess I could write it down in my planner or set a reminder on my phone. That might help me hold myself accountable.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Using a planner or phone reminders can keep your painting sessions prioritized. As you implement this, pay attention to how it influences your mood and productivity throughout the week.

User: I’ll definitely try that! I want to notice if it helps me manage stress better.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, Xiaohui. It’s all about observing how these changes affect you. We can also explore any feelings that arise, whether positive or negative, when you adjust this routine. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I think I need to reflect more on how things affect me.

Consultant: Reflection is key to understanding your emotions and responses. It might also help to journal about your experiences after your painting sessions. This way, you can track how your feelings fluctuate between studying and your hobby.

User: Journaling could be interesting! I’ve never really tried it before, but it sounds like a good way to keep track of everything.

Consultant: Give it a try! Journaling can provide insights and help you process your thoughts and feelings. You might discover patterns or triggers that impact your mood regarding school or painting.

User: I’m excited to start this! I really hope it helps me feel more balanced. 

Consultant: I believe it will, Xiaohui. This is a meaningful step towards taking control of your well-being. It’s such a positive change to integrate your passions into your life. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more confident about managing everything.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. The important thing is that you're taking steps to improve your situation. 

User: Right, I’ll keep that in mind. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: I'm here for you. Before we conclude, let’s briefly summarize what you’ll take away from today’s session. What do you feel are the key steps for you?

User: I’ll plan painting sessions on Sundays, use reminders to ensure I stick to them, and I’ll start journaling to reflect on my feelings.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! The anticipation of painting and reflecting on your experiences will boost your ability to manage stress. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel hopeful and more organized now. Thank you for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’ve made great progress, and I have confidence that you'll continue to foster those positive changes. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you once again. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaohui! Take care and enjoy your painting. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohui! I'm so glad to see you today. It sounds like you've made some progress recently, especially with your test scores. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yeah, I feel a bit better because of the teacher's praise. But I still worry about feeling lonely and keeping up with everything.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're feeling a bit better! Praise can really boost our confidence. Since you mentioned feeling lonely and overwhelmed, could you tell me more about what specifically has been weighing on you lately?

User: Well, I often feel like I don't connect with my classmates. I try to talk to them, but it feels awkward. It makes me feel like I'm an outsider.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling disconnected can be very difficult, especially at school where social interactions are so important. Have you thought about any specific situations that made you feel particularly lonely or isolated?

User: Yes, there was a group project last week. I wanted to contribute, but the others seemed to ignore my ideas. I felt so left out.

Consultant: I can imagine how frustrating and hurtful that must have felt. When moments like that happen, what kind of thoughts typically go through your mind?

User: I often think that no one likes me, or that I'm just not good enough to fit in. It's like this voice in my head keeps saying I'm a loser.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. How accurate do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence that contradicts this negative perspective?

User: Well, I did get some compliments on my test scores, and my teacher said I was improving. But then I just brush it off and focus on the negative stuff.

Consultant: It's a common tendency to focus on the negatives, but it's important to acknowledge your achievements as well. The fact that you received positive feedback shows that you are capable and growing. How does remembering your successes make you feel?

User: I guess it makes me feel a bit proud, but it’s easy for me to forget those good things when I’m down.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt proud! One strategy we can work on is how to remind yourself of these positive moments when you’re feeling low. How about we create a way for you to track your achievements and the positive things people say about you?

User: That sounds helpful. I’d like to remember the good stuff more often.

Consultant: Wonderful! Maybe we could set up a journal where you write down at least one positive thing that happens each day, or compliments you receive. How do you think you would feel looking back at your entries over time?

User: I think it would help me see that there are good things happening, even if I don’t notice them right away.

Consultant: That’s exactly the idea! This practice can help you reinforce a more balanced view of yourself, allowing you to celebrate your efforts and achievements. Are there any specific rewards you think you could give yourself when you reach certain goals or milestones?

User: Hmm, I like the idea of rewarding myself with some extra time to read my favorite books or watch a movie.

Consultant: Those sound like lovely rewards! Setting those as goals can help you feel excited about your progress. How often do you think you could take time to review your journal and reward yourself?

User: Maybe every week? I could look at what I wrote and if I’ve reached any goals, then treat myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Weekly reflections can give you a moment to appreciate your growth. Besides journaling, are there any other activities that make you feel good or bring you joy that we could incorporate into your routine?

User: I really enjoy drawing. It helps me relax a lot.

Consultant: Drawing is a fantastic way to express yourself and relieve stress! How about setting some time aside each week specifically for drawing? It could be a rewarding break for you after studying or completing your journal entries.

User: Yes, that would be nice! I could combine both things and draw what I’m feeling.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Art can be a wonderful outlet for emotions. And tracking how you felt while drawing can further enhance your understanding of your thoughts and feelings. What do you think you’ll do after our session to start implementing these ideas?

User: I think I’ll get a notebook for my journal and make a little time to draw this evening.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start, Xiaohui! Remember, you’re building a positive feedback loop for yourself. It’s all about taking small steps to recognize your progress. How do you feel about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel hopeful! I think these strategies can really help me keep a positive mindset.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! As we conclude today’s session, let’s take a moment to review what you’ve learned and how far you've come. You’ve successfully set up a plan to track your achievements and recognize your emotions through art. 

User: Yes, I see that! This feels encouraging.
