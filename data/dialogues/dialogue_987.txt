Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling a lot of pressure lately, especially with midterm exams coming up. Can you share a bit more about what you're experiencing?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I keep thinking about how disappointed everyone will be if I don't do well, and it's making me more anxious. I just feel like I'm a burden to my friends and family.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight, worrying about how others perceive you. Let's explore that feeling a bit. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I keep thinking that if I fail, I'm going to let everyone down. It's like I'm constantly reminding myself of all the times I've disappointed them before.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s possible those thoughts are amplifying your anxiety. How do these thoughts make you feel about yourself?

User: They make me feel really low and hopeless. Sometimes, I just want to hurt myself to feel better, even though I know it’s not the right answer.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings, but also to find healthier ways to cope. Have you thought about other ways to express your emotions or relieve your stress?

User: Not really. I just feel stuck. I try to ignore my feelings and push through the studying, but it never works.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stuck, especially when you’re under pressure. Let’s take a moment to recognize some of the emotions you’re experiencing. When you feel overwhelmed or anxious, what do you notice about your thoughts?

User: I guess I tend to think everything is going to go wrong. It feels like there’s no way out of this. 

Consultant: Those thoughts are definitely valid feelings, but it sounds like they might be a bit exaggerated. Can we explore some evidence for and against those beliefs? What might be a more balanced thought?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I’ve done well before, and that it’s okay to ask for help if I need it.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Recognizing your past successes and the value of seeking support can help shift your perspective. How would it feel to replace those negative thoughts with affirmations like that?

User: I think it would help a lot. It feels good to remember that not everything is as bad as I make it out to be.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about challenging those thoughts. Let’s talk about how you can implement some positive self-talk when you start feeling overwhelmed. What would you like to say to yourself in those moments?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach. It’s completely okay to make mistakes, and reaching out for support is important too. Speaking of support, how do you feel about talking to your parents about your feelings?

User: Honestly, I feel really hesitant. I think they’ll be disappointed in me.

Consultant: It’s natural to fear disappointment. However, opening up might actually help them understand what you’re going through better. What if you approach the conversation by expressing that you need their support?

User: That sounds tough, but maybe it could help. I just don’t want to let them down.

Consultant: Remember, sharing your struggles doesn’t make you a burden; it shows your strength. If you could focus on one positive outcome from that conversation, what would it be?

User: I guess I’d like them to understand that I’m trying my best, even if it may not seem like it.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! You deserve their understanding and support. How about practicing what you’d like to say to them? Maybe we could role-play that conversation together.

User: That might help. I often freeze up when I try to talk about my feelings.

Consultant: Let's get started. You can imagine I’m your parent. How would you open that conversation with them?

User: I’d probably start with, "Hey, can we talk about something important? I’ve been feeling really stressed lately."

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s direct and opens the floor for discussion. What do you want to express next about your feelings?

User: I want to say that I’m really struggling with schoolwork and that I feel like I’m disappointing them and myself.

Consultant: That’s honest and important to share. You’re doing well by articulating your feelings. How do you think they would respond to being approached this way?

User: Maybe they’d be understanding and want to help me. I hope they wouldn’t be too harsh.

Consultant: It’s likely they’ll want to support you, especially when they see how much it means to you to communicate honestly. Remember, they might also have been through challenging times themselves. 

User: That’s true. I guess I never thought about it that way.

Consultant: It can help to view them as allies rather than critics. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve identified some negative thoughts and come up with positive alternatives. You’ve also considered opening up to your parents. 

User: Yes, I feel like I’ve learned a lot today.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we conclude our session, what’s one strategy you plan to implement this week to manage your anxiety?

User: I think I’ll try the positive self-talk and see how that goes. I’ll also attempt to talk to my parents.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You’re taking some significant steps. Remember, it’s okay to take your time with everything. I'm here for you whenever you need guidance. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! You've made great progress. I believe in your ability to manage this, and I'm just a session away whenever you need support.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. My parents are worried about my studies, but I really don’t know how to talk to them about it. I feel like I’ve let them down.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and perhaps a bit isolated from your parents. Let’s explore this together. What do you think makes it difficult for you to communicate with them?

User: I just... I don’t want to disappoint them even more. What if they get angry or sad? I don’t want to be a burden.

Consultant: I can see that you’re worried about how they might react. It’s understandable to feel this way, especially when you care about their feelings. But remember, communicating can actually help them understand you better. What would you like to share with them if you felt comfortable doing so?

User: Maybe I want them to know that I’m trying, but it’s just been hard. I get anxious about my grades, and it’s affecting me more than I thought.

Consultant: That’s an important point. Expressing that you're trying your best, even when it’s tough, might help them see the full picture. Have you thought about how you might phrase those feelings when you talk to them?

User: Not really. I just get stuck thinking about how to start. I usually just end up avoiding the conversation altogether.

Consultant: Avoiding the topic can be tempting, but it might lead to misunderstandings that could make things more challenging. How about we work together on some phrases you could use to express your feelings? 

User: That could help, I guess. 

Consultant: Great! We can start with an “I” statement. For example, you could say, “I feel anxious about my grades, and I want to do better.” This way, you’re expressing your feelings without placing blame. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I like that it's about how I feel instead of blaming anyone.

Consultant: Exactly! It focuses on your feelings and encourages understanding rather than defensiveness. Have you had any moments where you felt like you could have talked to them but didn’t?

User: Yeah, there was this one time they asked about my reports, and I just brushed it off. I could tell they were concerned, but I didn’t know what to say.

Consultant: This shows that you are aware of their concerns, which is a good step. For the next time they ask, you could try saying something like, “I appreciate you asking, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed.” Would that feel manageable for you?

User: Yeah, that seems a bit easier than I thought.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s about taking small steps toward expressing yourself. How do you think they might respond to something like that?

User: I think they’d be surprised at first, but maybe they would understand I need support.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Acknowledging your feelings may open the door for them to offer support. What else do you think might help you in these conversations?

User: Maybe if I prepare a bit before I talk to them, it would help me feel more confident?

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparing can help you feel more in control. You could write down your feelings or worries and practice what you want to say. Would you be open to trying this?

User: Yeah, I could give it a try. It doesn’t sound as daunting when I think about it like that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in perspective! Starting small and practicing can build your confidence in expressing yourself. What else do you think you could do to feel more comfortable?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious. And I should focus on how talking might actually help me feel better.

Consultant: That’s an excellent point! Reminding yourself that it’s normal to feel anxious about these conversations can ease some of that pressure. How do you plan to approach your parents next time?

User: I’ll try to find a moment when things are calm and just open up about how I feel. I guess that feels more manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Choosing a calm moment can make you feel more at ease. As we prepare to wrap up today, how are you feeling about everything we've discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful that I can talk to them. It doesn’t seem impossible now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, these skills take practice, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. What will be your first step after today’s conversation?

User: I think I’ll write down how I feel and practice what I want to say before I talk to them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! I believe you can do this. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. If you need support, know that I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep believing in yourself. Have a great time practicing your conversation, and take care until next we meet!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's nice to see you again, A. I'm here to support you as we talk about your feelings and experiences. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to reach out to my friends again, but I feel really anxious about it. I made some handmade gifts for them, but I’m worried they’ll misinterpret my intentions or think I’m being weird.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It's great to hear that you’re trying to reconnect with your friends. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel worried about how they might react?

User: I guess I feel like my actions might seem desperate or awkward. I don’t want them to think I'm just reaching out out of obligation or that I’m too needy.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really concerned about how you’ll be perceived, and that's understandable. What kind of thoughts are running through your mind when you think about approaching your friends?

User: I keep telling myself that they probably don’t want to talk to me or that they might think I'm annoying. It makes me hesitate.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let's take a moment to explore them. You mentioned that you feel your friends might see you as annoying; can you think of any evidence that supports or challenges this thought?

User: Well, I don't really know if they would feel that way or not. I just feel like I've been a burden for so long that they might prefer not to interact with me.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a pattern of negative thinking here, possibly stemming from your past experiences. If a friend of yours were in a similar situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably say they shouldn't worry about what others think and just reach out because friends should support each other.

Consultant: That’s a really supportive perspective. So, if you were to apply that same advice to yourself, how might that change your approach to reaching out to your friends?

User: I guess I could try to focus on the positive side of things instead of dwelling on my fears. I mean, reaching out could be a good thing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positive aspects of reconnection might help ease the anxiety. How about we create a small plan? What’s one simple action you could take this week to connect with your friends?

User: Maybe I could send one of them a message saying hi, just to test the waters a bit?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful start! It’s a small step, but it can help rebuild your connection without overwhelming yourself. How do you think you will feel after sending that message?

User: I’m not sure. I feel anxious just thinking about it, but I also feel like it could be relieving to just say hi.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious. Let’s reframe that thought—what if instead of expecting the worst, you think of sending the message as an opportunity for something positive?

User: Thinking about it like that helps a bit. I guess it could lead to a nice conversation or even just lighten the burden of worrying.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s all part of the process. You’re taking action, which is a powerful step. Let’s also talk about how you can reassure yourself after you send that message. What positive affirmations could you say to yourself?

User: I could tell myself that it's okay to reach out and that my friends might appreciate it. I’m not a burden; I just want to be in touch.

Consultant: Those are great affirmations! Practicing them after sending the message could help to reinforce a more positive self-image. How do you feel about using those when you start to feel anxious?

User: It sounds helpful. I think reminding myself that I'm allowed to reach out will ease some of that pressure I usually feel.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to adopt! Now, as we focus on this strategy, let’s also consider how you might cope with the anxiety about upcoming exams. What thoughts come to mind regarding the exams?

User: I keep worrying that I will fail or not do as well as I want. I really don’t want to disappoint myself and my parents.

Consultant: I understand how intense that pressure can feel. Let’s try to break down those thoughts. Is there any evidence you have that supports or challenges the fear of failing?

User: I’ve done well in my classes before, but since I’ve been feeling down, I’ve been worried that I won’t perform like I used to.

Consultant: It’s a common concern when you’re feeling anxious or depressed. But remember, you’ve had success in the past. What strategies do you think could help you prepare effectively for your exams this time around?

User: Maybe I could set smaller study goals instead of overwhelming myself with trying to study everything all at once.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Breaking your study sessions into manageable parts can reduce stress and help you feel more accomplished. How about we set a specific mini-goal for your study time this week?

User: Sure! I think I could aim to review one subject each day this week. That feels doable.

Consultant: Perfect! And after each study session, it would be beneficial to acknowledge your effort. What self-affirming thoughts could you have after completing these study sessions?

User: I could say that I’m making progress and that it’s okay to take my time to learn what I need.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Keep reminding yourself of your progress and the actions you're taking. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed and how these strategies can support you moving forward.

User: I’ve learned that reaching out to friends can be positive and that I can manage my study anxiety with smaller goals. I feel more equipped now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’ve made great strides today, and remember, you can always return to these strategies whenever those negative thoughts arise. Keep practicing your affirmations and small goals. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I feel more hopeful about connecting with people and tackling my studies.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you today, A. Remember, every small step counts, and I believe you will continue to build on this progress. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about my exam results. I can't stop worrying about how I've done and what my parents will think. My mind keeps repeating negative thoughts about my performance.

Consultant: It sounds like those worries are very overwhelming for you. Let’s take a moment to explore what specific thoughts are running through your mind. What do you find yourself saying to yourself?

User: I keep thinking that I probably failed and that I’m going to let everyone down. I feel so stressed some days that I just want to hide away.

Consultant: I hear you. Those negative thoughts can be really tough to handle. Can you tell me what emotions come up when you think that way? 

User: I feel really anxious and sad. Sometimes I even get frustrated with myself for feeling this way.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially during this stressful time. Let's try to identify some patterns in your thinking. Do you notice if there are any specific moments or triggers that heighten these thoughts and feelings?

User: Usually it happens when I see my classmates chatting about their grades or when I think about my parents’ expectations. I feel like I can never live up to them.

Consultant: So, social situations and expectations create a lot of pressure for you. It sounds like you’re holding onto some pretty harsh beliefs about yourself. Let's explore those beliefs a bit more. Do you think they might be too extreme or unrealistic?

User: Maybe they are. I guess I do tend to jump to the worst conclusions, but it’s hard not to.

Consultant: It can be challenging to catch those thoughts in the moment. What do you think would happen if you took a step back and looked for any evidence that might support or contradict these negative thoughts?

User: I suppose I could think about the positive feedback I've gotten from my teachers before, but I find it hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It sounds like your previous successes get overshadowed by those anxious thoughts. How about we practice framing these beliefs in a more balanced way? 

User: Sure, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with one of your negative thoughts. You mentioned feeling like you failed. What could be a more balanced way to think about your exam results?

User: Maybe I could say that I tried my best, and it’s okay if I didn’t do perfectly. 

Consultant: Exactly! That self-compassion is key. Let’s reinforce that thought with a daily affirmation. How about saying, “I have worked hard, and it’s okay not to be perfect”? 

User: I like that. I can try to say that to myself. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! In addition to that, let’s also create a plan for how you can cope with the anxiety surrounding exam results. What activities help you feel calm or happy?

User: I enjoy drawing and sometimes playing video games. They distract me a bit.

Consultant: Those sound like great outlets. Would you be willing to set aside some time each week to engage in those activities as a way to relieve stress?

User: Yes, I could do that. Maybe it will help me relax.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in activities you love can help shift your focus away from the anxiety. Now, thinking about your friendships—how do you feel they’re handling all this?

User: Not great. I haven't really talked to them about this, and I feel embarrassed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, but remember, sharing your feelings can help strengthen your friendships. Maybe you could start small and reach out to someone you trust?

User: That sounds doable. I think I’ll try talking to one of my friends this week.

Consultant: That’s an excellent step, and I’m proud of you for considering it. Building those connections can really help with your emotional journey. 

User: I hope so. I really miss hanging out with my friends.

Consultant: I can imagine that. Connection is important, especially during tough times. It’s great to hear you're willing to take that step. 

User: Thanks for encouraging me! I’ll try to remind myself to be kinder about my performance too.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember that it's all about progress, not perfection. What we’ve discussed today is just the beginning. 

User: I feel a bit better already, thinking of it that way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful news! Just remember that you’re not alone in this journey, and it’s okay to ask for support when you need it.

User: Thank you so much for your help today. I really appreciate it!

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’re going to focus on this week: practicing self-compassion, reaching out to friends, and taking time for activities you enjoy. Sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: I have no doubt you will. Remember, take it one day at a time, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: I will. Thank you again, and see you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, I’ve started talking to my friends again and sharing study tips with them, which feels nice. But I still worry about making lasting connections and not being a burden to them.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you're re-establishing connections with your friends. Building those relationships is important. Can you tell me more about what concerns you most about being a burden?

User: I guess it’s just that I don’t want to drag them down with my problems. I feel like I should be the strong one, and I don't want them to think I’m needy.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Wanting to be strong for your friends shows you care. But it’s also okay to let them in and share how you’re feeling. Have you had any experiences recently where you felt comfortable opening up?

User: Well, I did share that I’ve been struggling a bit with studying and my feelings. They were supportive, but I just worry if I keep talking about my issues, they’ll get tired of me.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your friends were supportive. Your feelings are valid, and sharing them can strengthen your relationships. How did it feel when you opened up to them?

User: It felt good, actually. I felt less lonely for a moment. But then I thought maybe I shouldn’t have shared too much.

Consultant: It sounds like sharing brought you some relief. It’s natural to worry about overwhelming others, but friends often appreciate honesty. What if we practiced a scenario where you express your feelings without feeling overwhelmed? Would that be helpful?

User: That sounds interesting. How would we do that?

Consultant: We can role-play a conversation where you express your feelings to a friend, and I’ll provide feedback. This way, you can practice phrasing your thoughts to feel more confident. Are you comfortable with that?

User: Yes, I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say your friend asks you how you've been. Go ahead and respond as if I’m your friend.

User: I’d probably say something like, “I’ve been okay, just a little stressed about school and my feelings.” 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! You’re being honest and keeping it straightforward. How can you elaborate without feeling like you’re dumping too much on them?

User: Maybe I could add something like, “I’d love some advice on how to handle it, but I understand if you’re busy.” 

Consultant: Excellent! That's a good balance of openness and consideration for their time. This way, you invite support without overwhelming them. How does it feel to phrase it this way?

User: It feels better. I like that I’m giving them a choice to help or not.

Consultant: Exactly! It empowers both you and your friend. Now, what would you like to say next if they respond positively?

User: I might say, “I really appreciate it, thanks for being here for me.” 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Expressing gratitude reinforces your connection. How do you feel about practicing this approach when you talk to your friends?

User: I feel more confident. It sounds less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s think about how you can incorporate this into your interactions. How could you approach a friend next time you chat with them?

User: I think I’ll try to be more open about my stress and see how they respond, while keeping the conversation light too.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Balancing openness with lightness can help maintain the connection. What are some specific things you’d like to avoid while engaging with friends?

User: I don’t want to bring up too heavy topics if they are just trying to enjoy their day.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful consideration. Perhaps you can check in with them first, asking how they’re feeling before sharing your stress. What do you think of that strategy?

User: It seems reasonable. I could ask how their day was, then share if the time’s right.

Consultant: Absolutely! Opening the conversation this way shows you care about their feelings too. Do you think engaging in extracurricular activities might help you build these connections further?

User: Yes, I’ve thought about joining a club or something. It might help me meet new people.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can be a great way to connect with others over shared interests. How does the thought of joining a club make you feel?

User: I feel excited! It seems like a good opportunity to meet people without the pressure of it just being about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Exploring new activities can be both enjoyable and a chance for connection. What’s one club or activity you'd be interested in?

User: I could look into the art club. I like drawing, and it could be fun!

Consultant: The art club sounds like a wonderful choice! It allows you to express yourself creatively and connect with others. How do you plan to take the first step toward joining?

User: I think I’ll ask my art teacher about it tomorrow.

Consultant: That’s proactive! Asking your teacher is a fantastic first step. As you move forward, remember to give yourself the space to enjoy the process. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel really good. I’m more hopeful about connecting with people and I have a plan.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made significant progress today in building your confidence and approach to socializing. Remember, it's okay to reach out and share your experiences. 

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your support. I’ll let you know how it goes next time.

Consultant: I’d love that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I'm eager to hear about how you've been feeling lately. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually felt a bit better. I’ve been thinking about that extracurricular activity I mentioned. I’m both excited and a little nervous to try it out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling excited about trying new things is a positive sign of improvement. Can you tell me more about what specifically excites you about this activity?

User: I think it’s because it’s something new for me, and I like the idea of meeting new people who share similar interests. I really want to step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: Stepping out of your comfort zone can be challenging but rewarding! It sounds like you really want to make new connections and grow. What about the idea of this new activity feels a bit nervous for you?

User: I guess I'm worried about what people might think of me. What if I don’t fit in or mess things up? 

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal, especially when venturing into new social situations. Let’s explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that you wouldn’t fit in or that you might mess up?

User: I don’t have any solid evidence. I just think about past times when I felt awkward meeting new people.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It's common to focus on past experiences, but they don’t define your current potential. What would you say to a friend who had similar worries about fitting in?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone feels nervous sometimes and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Maybe they just need to be themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You can offer yourself that same kindness and understanding. Let's think about it this way—what if you allowed yourself to just be yourself in this new activity? What might that look like?

User: I think I could enjoy the experience more and not stress about others' opinions. I might just try to have fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Focusing on enjoyment rather than worry could really help you feel more at ease. How about we come up with a plan for when you start the activity? 

User: Sure! I could set a goal to talk to at least one new person each time I go.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! It’s specific and achievable. How do you think that would make you feel after each session?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself for making progress and maybe even look forward to going back.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those feelings of pride can be very empowering. What strategies can you use to remind yourself to focus on having fun instead of worrying?

User: I could write a note to myself or use reminders on my phone to stay positive. 

Consultant: Great idea! Visual reminders can be helpful. Would you like to discuss more ways to manage any anxiety that might come up before or during the activity?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed right before doing something new.

Consultant: One technique we can consider is taking deep breaths to help ground yourself before the activity. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise with me now?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to give it a try.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts... hold it for four counts... and exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Let’s repeat that a couple more times.

User: *breathes deeply* I feel a bit calmer already.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Practicing this regularly can help you manage anxiety. Now, what do you think you’ll feel like after trying this activity and using these strategies?

User: I hope I’ll feel more confident and less anxious. Maybe I’ll even make a few friends.

Consultant: I truly believe you can! You have shown a lot of courage by wanting to participate in something new. Do you feel ready to take this step forward?

User: Yes, I think I am! I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to be nervous, but I can still try and have fun while being myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing that mindset can lead to great experiences. Remember, the journey itself is important. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, you can always come back to these strategies we discussed.
