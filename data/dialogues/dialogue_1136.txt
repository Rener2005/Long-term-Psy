Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the start of a new semester?

User: Hi. To be honest, I'm feeling quite anxious and isolated. I struggle with forming connections with people, particularly with other girls. It makes me feel really lonely and frustrated.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure with your studies and relationships. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious in social situations?

User: I think I have a lot of negative thoughts about other women. I sometimes see them as dirty and hypocritical, which makes it hard for me to connect with them. This just adds to my feelings of isolation.

Consultant: That must be really challenging for you. It seems like there's a significant fear about how you view others and how they might view you. What do you think influenced these views you have about women?

User: I guess I've had some bad experiences in the past, and I tend to generalize those to all women. I feel like I can't trust them and this stops me from opening up.

Consultant: It makes sense that past experiences could shape your current feelings. It might be helpful to explore specific instances that contributed to these beliefs. Can you recall a recent situation that has reinforced your thoughts?

User: Just last week, I tried to talk to a girl in my class, but the conversation felt really superficial, and I ended up feeling like I was just being judged. It made me feel hopeless about trying to make friends.

Consultant: That sounds really disheartening. Feeling judged can heighten anxiety and make it difficult to connect. What thoughts went through your mind during and after that conversation?

User: I thought maybe I was just not likable or that she didn't really care about what I had to say. I ended up feeling worse about myself and just wanted to avoid talking to anyone.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh. Let’s pause for a moment—how supportive do you think those thoughts are for you? Is there another way to interpret the situation?

User: I know I shouldn’t be so hard on myself, but in the moment, it's hard to think otherwise. I really want to have close friendships, but these thoughts just keep popping up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's explore how we can challenge some of these negative beliefs. What evidence do you have that someone wouldn't be interested in you as a friend?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence; it’s just how I feel when I approach someone. I see them as judging me before I even say anything.

Consultant: It seems like there's a disconnect between your feelings and reality. If a friend were in your position, what guidance would you give them about those feelings?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to not be perfect and that they shouldn’t assume the worst about others' intentions.

Consultant: That’s great advice! Why not try applying that same kindness to yourself? What would it take for you to believe in the possibility that others might be interested and supportive?

User: I suppose I would need to remind myself that not everyone is the same and that some people might actually want to get to know me.

Consultant: Exactly! We can work on building that belief gradually. To practice this, can you think of a small step you could take to open up a conversation with someone new in your class this week?

User: Maybe I could start by asking someone about a class assignment just to break the ice. It feels less intimidating than diving into deeper topics.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Starting with something related to class can help ease the anxiety. How about you also prepare a positive statement about yourself to share in that conversation?

User: I could mention that I’m really interested in the subject and that I like to discuss different viewpoints. It’s something I genuinely enjoy.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Sharing your interests can invite others to engage with you positively. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I just really hope it goes okay.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new. Remember, it’s all about small steps. If it goes differently than you expect, that’s part of learning too. How will you handle it if it doesn’t go as planned?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that it's just one conversation and not a reflection of my worth. It won't define me.

Consultant: That's an excellent perspective! Keeping that in mind can lessen the pressure. After you try this, we can discuss how it went during our next session. Sound good?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Just talking about this has already relieved some of my anxiety.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Building connections takes time and effort, but you're on the right path. Would you like to discuss any other concerns or feelings before we wrap up?

User: I just still feel a bit heavy about how I perceive women. I want to change that, but I’m not sure how.

Consultant: That's a critical point, and it's great that you want to work on it. Together, we can explore where those feelings come from and try to replace them with more balanced views. For now, let's focus on your upcoming conversation, and we can dive deeper into this in our next meeting.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help. I'll try to be kinder to myself and open up more.

Consultant: You're doing wonderfully, and I'm proud of your willingness to try. Remember, every little step counts, and I’m here to support you. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Bai! I'm glad to see you. I want to start by acknowledging what you've been feeling. Can you share more about your experiences recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really upset. Recently, during a campus event, I noticed that my classmates formed groups and I wasn't invited to join them. It made me feel really isolated, like I don’t belong.

Consultant: I can hear how painful that must have been for you, feeling excluded can really hurt. It seems that this situation has made you doubt your relationships with others. What emotions did you experience when you found out you weren’t invited?

User: I felt angry and sad, like maybe I’m not good enough. It’s frustrating because I want to connect with them, but it feels like they don’t want to include me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, Bai. When you think about not being included, it affects how you view yourself and your relationships. Can you share any specific thoughts that went through your mind during that moment? 

User: I kept thinking that they must not like me. I felt like I was being judged and that I’m just an outsider. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and discouraging. It's common to think the worst about ourselves in such situations. Have you noticed how those thoughts made you feel in terms of your anxiety or tension?

User: Yes, they really did increase my anxiety. I started to feel tense and just wanted to avoid everyone. I hate that feeling.

Consultant: Avoiding can seem like a way to cope, but it might also increase those feelings of isolation and anxiety. Let’s explore together: if a friend were in your shoes, what might you suggest they consider about the situation?

User: I guess I would tell them it’s not personal and maybe it’s just how things turned out, right? But I don’t really believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective. It shows that you can think about it differently when it involves someone else. Why do you think it's easier to have empathy for a friend compared to yourself?

User: I think it's because I’m not as emotionally involved when it’s about someone else. I can see the situation clearer without the weight of my feelings.

Consultant: That makes sense. Your emotions can cloud your judgment about yourself. Let's work on challenging those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates don’t like you? 

User: I don’t have concrete evidence. It just seems that way because I wasn’t invited. But I suppose I don’t know what they really think.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing that. Sometimes our feelings can lead us to conclusions that aren’t entirely accurate. What could be some other explanations for their behavior that don’t involve personal rejection?

User: Maybe they just didn't think about me? It could be that they assumed I was busy or didn’t want to join.

Consultant: That’s an insightful alternative! By considering other possibilities, you challenge the belief that it’s all about you being excluded. How does this new perspective affect how you feel about the incident?

User: I feel a bit lighter, like maybe it's not all my fault. But I still feel upset about not being included. 

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel upset. Shifting thoughts doesn’t erase the pain of exclusion. Let’s think about what steps you can take moving forward. What can you do to express your desire to connect with your classmates?

User: I could try to reach out and join them next time, maybe initiate a conversation to show I'm interested.

Consultant: That’s a proactive plan! Taking that step could open up new opportunities for connection. How do you feel about taking this action?

User: I feel a little scared, but also hopeful. I'm nervous about how they might respond, though.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared when stepping out of your comfort zone. We could practice together how to approach them. How do you imagine starting that conversation?

User: I might say something like, "Hey, I saw you guys hanging out, and I’d love to join next time!" 

Consultant: That sounds friendly and inviting! It's straightforward and opens the door for further connection. How do you feel about practicing this kind of approach together?

User: I think I’d like that. Practicing could help ease my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can make it easier when the moment comes. Let’s take a moment to formulate responses for various reactions you might encounter. How might you handle it if they seem unsure? 

User: Maybe I could say, "No pressure, I just wanted to hang out!" That way, they know I won't be upset if they don’t want to include me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! It shows you're flexible and understanding. As we work together on this, it's also important to reflect on your feelings after you take these steps. How will you check in with yourself about the outcome?

User: I guess I could journal about how I felt before and after talking to them. That might help me process things.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent strategy! It can help you articulate your feelings and track your progress over time. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve learned. What do you think are the key takeaways from this session? 

User: I learned that my thoughts about being excluded aren’t always accurate. I can consider different perspectives, and I have some actions I could take to connect better with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary, Bai! Recognizing those thought patterns and taking proactive steps are significant strides towards improving your situation. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to have complex feelings about it all. How are you feeling about everything as we finish today?

User: I'm feeling a mix of anger and disappointment, but also a bit of hope now that I have some ideas. I want to work on this.

Consultant: Hope is a great feeling to hold onto! I'm here to support you as you navigate these feelings and experiences. Looking forward to our next session where we can continue this work. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I've noted that you have some concerns about your interpersonal relationships and a recent conflict with a classmate. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really angry and disappointed. The whole situation left me with a bad taste, and now I just feel even more resistant to working in teams.

Consultant: I can understand how frustrating that must feel. It’s difficult when conflicts arise, especially in collaborative settings. Can you tell me more about what happened with your classmate that led to this conflict?

User: We were working on a project together, and we had a disagreement about how to proceed. I felt my opinion was dismissed, and it just escalated from there. Now, I don’t even want to think about group work.

Consultant: That sounds very difficult, especially feeling dismissed in a group. It’s common to feel a mix of anger and disappointment in these situations. What were some of the thoughts that went through your mind when you felt your opinion wasn't valued?

User: I thought maybe I wasn't capable enough, or that my ideas were stupid. It made me really doubt myself and feel even angrier at my classmate.

Consultant: It's understandable that those thoughts would arise, especially in a frustrating moment. Sometimes our automatic thoughts can be quite harsh. Can we explore those feelings and thoughts together? What would you say to someone else in your position who felt their ideas were not being appreciated?

User: I guess I would tell them that their ideas are valid, and they shouldn’t feel bad for voicing them. It’s just hard to practice that with myself.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that we often are our own worst critics. Let’s try to challenge some of those negative thoughts. How strong do you think the evidence is for the belief that your ideas are not good or acceptable?

User: I don’t know... I suppose I just got caught up in the moment. It felt really personal, but maybe it wasn't. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way in the heat of the moment. It sounds like you're beginning to see that what happened might not reflect your abilities or worth. What alternative thoughts could we come up with that might empower you instead of holding you back?

User: Maybe I could think that disagreements are just part of working with others, and that my ideas can still be valuable even if they aren’t accepted at first.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective! Focusing on the value of your contributions and understanding that differing opinions are natural can really help ease the tension. What can you do differently next time there’s a disagreement in a group setting?

User: I could try to communicate my thoughts more clearly and maybe ask for feedback instead of just reacting when things don’t go my way.

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing clear communication is key. Additionally, how do you think you might feel if you were able to express your thoughts more openly, even if there’s some disagreement?

User: I think it would feel less frustrating because I wouldn't hold everything in. It’s just scary to put myself out there again.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal to feel a bit scared. Putting yourself out there takes courage, and it’s okay to start slowly. What if we create a simple plan for you to practice this with a classmate or friend? 

User: That could help. I think I would feel more comfortable trying it with someone I know.

Consultant: Great idea! You might try expressing a thought or opinion on a lighter topic first, just to build your confidence. What might be a good subject for that kind of conversation?

User: Maybe we could chat about a movie we both watched recently, or something like that. 

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Starting with something light can make it easier to practice. Then, when you're ready, you can work your way back to more serious topics. How do you feel about attempting this in the coming week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited to try it out. It might help me step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude to have! It’s completely natural to feel nervous about stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, each small step will help build your confidence. How can we ensure you stay motivated after this session?

User: Maybe I could jot down some notes or reminders about what we talked about today. Recalling our discussions might help me stay on track.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Writing down your thoughts and our strategies can keep you focused and remind you of your progress. Before we wrap up today, how do you feel about your journey towards building better relationships now compared to the start of our session?

User: I feel more open to it, even if I still feel unsure. I want to give it a try and see how it goes.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Feeling uncertain is a normal part of the process, but your willingness to try is what matters most. Before our next meeting, please remember that challenging yourself in small ways can lead to big changes. You’ve gained a lot of insights today.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll definitely keep your advice in mind.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. If you ever need to talk or process any challenges before our next meeting, don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing how your practice goes!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. I remember you mentioned wanting to improve your social connections, especially in your new club activities. How have things been for you lately?

User: Hi! Thank you for having me. I've actually started participating more in the club activities. It's exciting but also a bit overwhelming. I feel like I'm trying to connect with people, but I don't always know how to respond to their friendliness.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward! It’s normal to feel a mix of excitement and overwhelm when meeting new people. Can you share a little about a recent interaction that felt challenging or confusing for you?

User: Well, last week, one of the older students invited me to join in a group discussion, and I felt so surprised. I didn't know how to respond. I think I just smiled and said maybe, but I felt like I missed an opportunity to connect.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel surprised in those moments. It sounds like you were caught off guard. What kind of response do you wish you would have given instead?

User: I wish I could have confidently said yes and maybe even asked a question to keep the conversation going, but I froze up. It’s like my brain just stopped.

Consultant: Freezing in such moments is quite common, especially when you're trying to establish new relationships. Let’s explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind when this student invited you to join the discussion? 

User: I thought things like “What if they don’t really want me there?” or “What if I say something dumb?” It made me hesitate.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really create a barrier. It seems like you're concerned about how others perceive you. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. Is there any evidence that the older students don’t want you in the discussion? 

User: Not really. They seemed friendly and welcoming. I guess I just assumed the worst.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognized that! It sounds like there’s a possibility that your worries might be a bit exaggerated. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about joining the discussion?

User: I would probably tell them to just go for it and not to worry too much about others' opinions.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! It shows that you can be compassionate towards others. How about extending that same kindness to yourself? What could be a small step you could take next time to respond more positively to similar invitations?

User: Maybe I could practice saying yes in advance or thinking of a simple follow-up question, like asking their opinion on the topic we’d discuss.

Consultant: Practicing those responses sounds like an excellent strategy! It may help you feel more prepared and confident. How do you feel about trying that next time?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. It seems like a solid plan.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely normal, especially as you step into new situations! Remember, it’s a learning process. If things don’t go as planned, it’s an opportunity to reflect and adjust next time. What’s one thing you might say or do to approach this next interaction with a lighter heart?

User: I think I could remind myself that everyone is there to learn and have fun too. It's not just about me.

Consultant: Absolutely, everyone is there for the shared experience and learning! Keeping that perspective can ease some pressure. What other gentle reminders could you offer yourself?

User: Maybe to just enjoy the moment and not worry so much about trying to impress anyone.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reminder! Focusing on enjoyment rather than pressure can definitely help you engage more like a friend. Let’s summarize what you've learned about yourself today. What has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I’ve realized that I tend to overthink social situations, which makes me hesitate. I want to practice a more relaxed approach and be kinder to myself when interacting with others.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, and I’m glad you’re feeling that way. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s think about how you’ll apply this in future interactions. Are there any specific situations you’re looking forward to trying your new strategies?

User: Yes! I have another meeting in the club next week, and I can practice my responses then. I’ll also try to remind myself to enjoy the experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. You're taking meaningful steps toward building connections. If you face a setback, it’s completely okay; just keep practicing! 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and encouragement. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made wonderful progress today. Just take it one interaction at a time, and remember you're not alone in this journey. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next time we talk! 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely share my experiences. Thanks again! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm really glad you're here. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit surprised because some of my male classmates have been quite friendly towards me. They even invited me to join them for social activities. It's nice, but I feel a bit hesitant about accepting their kindness.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel surprised when someone reaches out in a friendly way, especially if you're not used to it. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel hesitant about accepting their kindness?

User: I guess I'm worried about what they really want from me. I often think that people are just being nice to me because they want something in return, or that I won't know how to respond properly.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some thoughts about trusting others and how to interact with them. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What do you believe they might want from you, and how does that influence your feelings towards them?

User: I feel like they might want me to socialize more, but I worry that I'm not interesting enough for them. It makes me anxious, and I end up just avoiding situations where I have to interact.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel anxious if you're worried about not being interesting enough. But let's challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that you aren't interesting or that they expect something specific from you?

User: Well, I don't have a lot of exciting things happening in my life, and I sometimes feel awkward in conversations. 

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. However, think about the last time you had a conversation with someone. Did they express interest in what you were saying, or did you feel like they were bored?

User: Actually, there were a few times when they seemed engaged and interested in my opinions. I guess I just focus too much on the negative moments.

Consultant: That's an important realization. It’s easy to get caught up in negative thoughts. Let's focus on what you can do moving forward. How do you feel about the idea of accepting their friendliness and engaging with them more?

User: I think I should try, but I'm still a bit scared that I'll mess it up or that they'll think I'm weird.

Consultant: It's normal to feel scared, but remember that everyone has their own insecurities. What if we set a small goal for you? Maybe you could start by responding positively to their invitation, just to see what happens?

User: That sounds manageable. Maybe I could go to one of the social activities and see how it goes.

Consultant: Yes! That's a great step forward. How about you think of a few simple responses you could give when they invite you—something you feel comfortable saying?

User: I could say something like, “That sounds fun! I would love to join.” 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a warm and inviting response. How do you think you would feel if you used that response?

User: I think I’d feel a little nervous at first, but also excited. It would feel nice to connect with them.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Excitement is a positive emotion to focus on. Let’s also discuss how you can manage any anxious feelings that come up during the event itself. What are some strategies you think might help you stay calm?

User: I could take deep breaths or remind myself that it's okay to be myself, no matter what they think.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Deep breathing can help calm your nerves, and reminding yourself of your worth is powerful. Would you feel comfortable practicing those strategies before the event?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I feel like I can be more prepared for what might happen.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation can boost your confidence. Let's summarize what you plan to do: You’ll accept the invitation, respond positively, practice deep breathing, and remind yourself to be yourself. Does that sound like a good plan?

User: Yes, it does! I feel more motivated to try this now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, this is a learning experience. If it doesn’t go perfectly, that’s okay—each interaction helps you grow. How do you feel about where we are now?

User: I feel pretty good. I’m excited to give it a go and see what happens.

Consultant: That's great energy! We’ve made some significant progress today. Looking ahead, how would you like to maintain this positive attitude towards social interactions?

User: I could keep reminding myself of this conversation and how it felt to make a plan. Maybe I can also journal my experiences afterward.

Consultant: Journaling sounds like a wonderful idea! It will help you reflect on your experiences and reinforce your progress. As we wrap up today, take a moment to think about what you've learned and how you'll move forward.

User: I’ve learned that I can be open to friendship without overthinking it too much. I’m really hopeful now!

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You’ve shown great willingness to embrace this change. Remember, it's all about small steps and building trust. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out again.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support and guidance today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of what you've accomplished, and I believe in your ability to handle these situations. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Until then, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bai! I'm really glad to see you again today. It's great to hear about your recent success collaborating on that project. How are you feeling about your interactions with others and the progress you've made?

User: Hi! Thank you. I've been feeling really good about it! Working together with that classmate and getting positive feedback made me feel more confident. But sometimes, I still worry about how to maintain those good relationships.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident after that project. Confidence in relationships is key. Can you share what specific aspects of maintaining those relationships feel challenging for you?

User: I think I often worry about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough. I sometimes feel like I don’t know how to keep conversations flowing naturally.

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common when it comes to social interactions. It's understandable to worry about keeping conversations engaging. What do you think makes a conversation feel natural for you?

User: I guess when it feels like a back-and-forth exchange. But I often feel nervous when it’s my turn to speak, and that makes me freeze up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really aware of what makes conversations flow well. Let’s explore that a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel nervous in a conversation?

User: I start thinking that people might find me boring or not want to listen to what I have to say. That makes me want to withdraw.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It seems like your thoughts about being perceived negatively can create a cycle of anxiety for you. Have you noticed any specific situations where this has happened recently?

User: Yes, during group discussions in class. I sometimes hesitate to speak up because of those thoughts. Even though I want to contribute, I hold back.

Consultant: That holding back must be tough for you, especially since you want to engage. What if we tried to challenge those negative thoughts? How likely do you think it is that others actually see you as boring?

User: I guess it's not very likely. I mean, my classmates are often supportive. Maybe I'm just too hard on myself.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, Bai! It's not uncommon to be our own biggest critics. Let's try something: If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them regarding their worries about being boring in conversations?

User: I would tell them to be themselves and that everyone has something interesting to say. Maybe I should follow my own advice!

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Focusing on being yourself is truly key. Would you like to set any specific intentions for your future interactions to help you feel more comfortable?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect, and I should just enjoy the conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing imperfection will certainly help ease some of that pressure. Alongside this reminder, would you like to practice some techniques to manage those anxious feelings before conversations in class?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! What do you suggest?

Consultant: One technique could be deep breathing. Before you enter a conversation, take a few deep breaths to ground yourself. Would it be helpful if we practiced this together right now?

User: Sure! I’d like that.

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in… hold it for a moment… and now exhale slowly. Let’s do that twice more together. Inhale… hold… and exhale. One last time, deep breath in… hold… exhale. How did that feel?

User: That felt calming! I can see how doing that before talking would help.

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating these calming moments can make a difference. As we wrap up, let's reflect on your progress. What strategies do you think will help you the most as you continue to improve your relationships?

User: I definitely think breathing exercises and reminding myself to just be myself will help a lot. I feel more prepared to face the social situations that make me nervous.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear, Bai! Remember that you're already on a great path with the insights you've gained today. If you run into any challenges, what steps will you take to reinforce your learning?

User: I can practice the breathing techniques and remind myself of our discussions. I’ll also consider reaching out to friends when I feel unsure.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! Before we finish today, is there anything else you'd like to explore or any concerns you'd like to address?

User: No, I feel like we've covered a lot. I'm feeling much better now!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It sounds like you're well on your way to maintaining those positive relationships. Keep practicing those techniques, and remember we’re here for you if you need support in the future. Take care, and best of luck with everything!

User: Thank you! I'm really grateful for your help. I’ll see you next time!
