Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. It seems like you’ve been going through a tough time with the transition to university. Can you tell me a bit more about how you’ve been feeling since you arrived?

User: Hi. Thanks for having me. To be honest, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. When my parents left, I just lost it. It was hard to breathe, and I felt completely lost in a place I’m supposed to be excited about.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed after such a big change. Could you share more about what emotions came up for you during that moment when your parents left?

User: I was just so anxious and scared. It felt like I couldn’t handle being alone. It’s like everything that’s happening here is too much for me, and I miss my home. I also find myself avoiding talking to anyone.

Consultant: It’s common to feel such a strong sense of loss and anxiety during a big change like this. It seems you’re experiencing a lot of fear about being in this new environment. Have there been any specific thoughts or beliefs that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to be lonely forever and that I don’t belong here. It feels like everyone else is managing fine, and I’m just a mess.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. It sounds like you’re being quite hard on yourself. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you don’t belong here? 

User: I guess it’s just how I feel. Seeing everyone else laugh and hang out makes me feel even more isolated. 

Consultant: Feeling isolated can definitely reinforce those beliefs. But remember, feelings aren’t always facts. If a friend felt the same way, what would you say to them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to be struggling and that they shouldn’t compare themselves to others. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to be kind to yourself too. What if we tried to challenge the idea that you don’t belong? Can you think of times where you felt a connection, or moments that made you feel welcome since you've been here?

User: Well, there was one time when I participated in a group activity, and I did enjoy it. But then I got scared to join again because of the anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’ve experienced moments of connection, even if anxiety has made it hard to engage further. We can work on gradually facing those fears. How would you feel about setting small goals for yourself to join in more activities?

User: That sounds doable, but I’m still worried I won’t fit in.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. How about we break it down? We can start with a small step, like saying hello to someone in class or joining a study group just for a little while. What do you think?

User: Yeah, saying hi doesn’t sound too bad. I could try that.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s make a plan for this week. After you say hi, notice how you feel afterward. Writing down your feelings might help. 

User: I can do that. I think just trying it out will be a little less scary than I imagine.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, each step, no matter how small, is a progress. How do you feel about your self-worth right now? 

User: I don’t feel great about it. I often doubt if I’m good enough or if I’ll ever fit in.

Consultant: Let’s work on that together. Sometimes reminding ourselves of our strengths can help. Can you think of any qualities or skills you have that make you unique?

User: I guess I’m a good listener. My friends used to tell me that.

Consultant: That’s a valuable quality! Being a good listener can help you connect with others and build relationships. How about using that skill to reach out to someone? 

User: That could work. I could ask someone their thoughts about a class or something.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a great way to start a conversation. Remember, you’re not alone in this. Everyone is adapting in their own way, including your classmates. 

User: I guess I never thought about it that way. Thanks for perspective.

Consultant: I’m glad you found it helpful! We’re starting to uncover ways you can shift your mindset. As we approach the end of our session today, what strategies do you think you’ll use moving forward to combat those feelings of loneliness?

User: I’ll try to be more open to conversation and remind myself it’s okay to feel this way.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Taking actionable steps is key. I believe in your ability to adapt and grow through this experience. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. Talking about this helps a lot, and I feel more hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this journey. It’s okay to take it one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep working on it.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhao! I believe in you, and I’ll be here whenever you need support. Take care until our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you here today. I know we've been discussing your feelings of loneliness and your desire to build deeper connections in your new environment. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to join more activities, but I still feel really lonely. I talk to people, but it feels superficial, and I can't seem to connect with anyone. I worry that I might never make close friends here.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been putting in a lot of effort to be social, yet you’re feeling that these connections aren’t as deep as you’d like. That must be really challenging. Can you share a bit more about your experiences in these activities?

User: Well, I’ve joined a few clubs, and I do meet people there. Sometimes we chat, but it feels like we’re just being polite. I find it hard to open up about myself. I feel like they won’t care anyway.

Consultant: It makes sense that you feel hesitant to open up, especially since building connections can feel daunting. Let’s explore your thoughts a bit. When you think about sharing something personal with them, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I worry they might not be interested or that they’ll judge me. Sometimes I think, “Why would they want to know about me?” It makes me hesitate.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, and I can see how they might hold you back from engaging more deeply. Let's challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t be interested in you?

User: I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. It’s just how I feel. I often feel like I’m not interesting enough compared to others.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in a new environment. However, it seems like these thoughts are based on feelings rather than facts. If a friend were in your shoes feeling the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them they are interesting and that people would appreciate getting to know them. I’d try to encourage them to share more.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You can offer that same kindness to yourself. What if you approached interactions with that mindset? How might that change how you engage with others?

User: I guess if I thought I had something worth sharing, I might feel more confident. Maybe I could even start with small things before diving into deeper topics.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small can build your confidence gradually. What’s one small sharing you could practice in your next conversation? 

User: Maybe I could talk about my interests in movies or hobbies. That seems safe enough.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Sharing your interests can spark more meaningful conversations. How do you feel about setting that goal for your next interactions?

User: I feel a bit excited! It feels easier to think about starting small. I’ll try to focus on that.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Excitement is a positive step forward. What strategies can you think of to keep yourself grounded and calm when you’re sharing?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that it's okay to be vulnerable. I could also think about the fun of connecting rather than worrying about their reactions.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Focusing on the fun of connecting can shift your mindset. As you engage more with others, let’s also keep an eye on how you feel about yourself through this process. How do you think you would feel after sharing your interests?

User: I think I might feel more confident and maybe a bit less anxious. If I can open up, it might help me see that I’m worth getting to know.

Consultant: I love that insight! That realization can truly empower you. As you practice sharing and connecting, let’s talk about ways to build upon that confidence. What do you think might help reinforce that feeling of being worth getting to know?

User: I could remind myself of positive experiences I’ve had with friends back home or think of strengths I have. Maybe it would help me reassure myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on past positive experiences and your strengths can create a more balanced view of yourself. Would you like to set a small goal about this for our next session?

User: Yes! I’d like to keep a journal of my strengths and positive experiences. I’ll share that with you next time.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Zhao! Keeping a journal can help reinforce your self-worth and give you reminders of who you are. As you continue to engage with others, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate any small progress.

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. I feel like I’m starting to have a plan and that feels good.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling more positive about this. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway or thought you’d like to carry with you until our next session?

User: I think it would be to remind myself that starting small is okay, and to trust that I have something valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Remember, taking those small steps can lead to significant changes over time. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I’m glad you’re here today. It sounds like you've had a challenging time recently. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been really anxious. The other day, I went out with some classmates, and I got lost. It felt like my heart was racing, and I just felt so helpless in this new place.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, especially being in a new environment. It's natural to feel anxious when you're faced with something unfamiliar. What thoughts came to your mind during that moment when you got lost?

User: I kept thinking about how I shouldn't have gone out alone. I felt like I was completely useless and that everyone else was more capable than me.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts made the situation feel even more intense. It's common to compare ourselves to others, but I’d like to explore those feelings—do you often feel that way in different situations?

User: Yes, I think so. I often feel like I don’t measure up, especially compared to my classmates. It makes me second guess my decisions a lot.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let’s break it down a bit. When you think about not measuring up, what emotions do you notice in yourself?

User: I feel anxious and a bit depressed. When I think I’m not good enough, it really affects my mood.

Consultant: That’s a strong connection between your thoughts and feelings. These anxious thoughts can create a cycle that leaves you feeling stuck. Have you noticed any thoughts that triggered these feelings recently, apart from the incident of getting lost?

User: Sometimes, when I see others succeed in class or make friends quickly, I feel this deep jealousy and hopelessness about my own situation.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re navigating such a significant change in your life. Let’s try something together: imagine speaking to yourself as if you were a good friend. What would you tell yourself in those moments of self-doubt?

User: I think I’d tell myself that it’s okay to struggle and that everyone has their own pace. But it’s hard to believe that sometimes.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Just like you would reassure a friend, it's important to give yourself that same kindness. Let’s aim to challenge these negative thoughts. What if we consider evidence against the idea that you’re not good enough? What are some strengths or skills you have?

User: Well, I’m good at art, and I’ve received compliments on my work. And I think I'm pretty friendly, even though I’m shy.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! It sounds like you have talents and qualities to lean on, even if they don’t always come to the forefront during anxious times. How do you think you could use your art or friendly nature to feel more confident in new situations?

User: Maybe I could try joining an art club or something. That could help me meet more people and maybe feel less anxious.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea, Zhao! Engaging in activities you love can definitely help you feel more connected and confident. Let’s consider small steps you could take towards joining that club. What could your first step be?

User: I could look up when the next meeting is and see if I can go with someone I know, so I don’t feel alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical and supportive plan. It’s great to take that first step with someone you trust. Let’s also talk about how you can prepare for moments when you might feel anxious or lost in the future. What strategies do you think could help you in those situations?

User: I guess I could practice some deep breathing techniques to calm down. And maybe try to remember that I’ve handled tough situations before.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be very effective in reducing anxiety. Also, reminding yourself of past successes is powerful. You’ve shown resilience already. How can you keep those reminders accessible when facing new challenges?

User: Maybe I could write them down and carry them with me—things I’ve achieved or positive affirmations.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Keeping those reminders on hand can provide reassurance when you need it. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve talked about and what you're taking away from this session. What stands out to you the most?

User: I feel like I have some concrete steps to take, especially regarding joining the art club and reminding myself of my strengths. It makes me feel hopeful.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You’re recognizing your own potential, and that's a big step forward. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain, but you're gaining tools that can empower you. If you ever feel lost or anxious again, I encourage you to revisit those strengths and coping strategies we've discussed.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our chat today. It makes me feel more confident about dealing with things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! I believe in your ability to adapt and thrive. As you explore new interests, I’m here to support you. Don’t hesitate to reach out when you need to talk. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I know you've been exploring psychology and engaging with activities at your school. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better since I started participating in the psychology club activities. I find the discussions interesting, but I still struggle with managing my emotions sometimes.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're finding the psychology club engaging! Joining a new group can often help with feelings of loneliness. Can you share more about what emotions you find challenging to manage?

User: I still feel lonely sometimes, especially when I'm not with my friends or when things get overwhelming. I often worry about whether I'm fitting in or making the right connections.

Consultant: Those feelings of loneliness and insecurity are quite common, especially in a new environment. It sounds like you're navigating a lot of new experiences. When you're feeling lonely, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that maybe I'm not good enough to make friends or that others don't want to include me. It's really disheartening.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts contribute significantly to your feelings of loneliness. Let's explore this further—what evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Are there situations where you felt included or valued?

User: Well, during the club meetings, people are friendly and seem to enjoy my input. I guess I just worry that those moments are exceptions rather than the norm.

Consultant: That's an important realization! It seems there are positive interactions that you can hold onto. What if we challenged that idea that those moments are just exceptions? What alternative thoughts could you consider?

User: Maybe I could think that everyone is also looking to connect and that I might be more capable of making friends than I believe.

Consultant: That's a great shift in perspective! Viewing it as a shared journey rather than feeling isolated can make a significant difference. How do you feel when you think about potential friendships in this way?

User: I feel a little lighter and more hopeful! It's comforting to think that we are all in the same boat.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This shift can help you feel more empowered as you continue to build connections. Have you thought about any specific steps you could take to enhance those connections?

User: I could try to initiate conversations with others in the club or invite someone to hang out after meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Taking the initiative can often lead to deeper connections. How do you anticipate feeling when you take those steps?

User: I think I would feel more confident and maybe even excited to see how others respond.

Consultant: That excitement is a positive sign! It seems like you're developing a proactive approach toward your social connections. What might you do if you encounter setbacks or if things don't go as planned when reaching out?

User: I suppose I should remind myself that it’s okay not to connect with everyone right away and that it doesn’t reflect my worth as a person.

Consultant: Exactly! Allowing yourself that grace can be very important. Maintaining a realistic view of social interactions can reduce pressure. What strategies could you employ if you find yourself feeling down about it?

User: I could talk to someone I trust about how I'm feeling or distract myself with activities I enjoy, like studying psychology.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Utilizing your interests or reaching out for support can be very effective. It seems like you're becoming more equipped to handle these feelings. How do you feel about making these plans as we wrap up today’s session?

User: I feel more prepared and optimistic about connecting with others. I'm excited to apply what we discussed!

Consultant: That's amazing to hear! Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to feel uncertain at times. Before we end our session, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss?

User: Not really, I believe we covered a lot. I'm grateful for this conversation; it really helps.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Zhao! You've made wonderful progress today. Just keep in mind the strategies we've discussed, and remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. If any feelings come up later, don't hesitate to reach out again. I'm here to help. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. I remember you shared some positive experiences about your participation in the recent sports event at school. How have things been going since then?

User: Hi! Yes, the sports event was great! I really felt like I belonged to a team, but I still sometimes feel a bit lonely, especially when I'm not involved in activities.

Consultant: It sounds like your involvement in the sports event boosted your sense of belonging, which is fantastic! However, the loneliness you experience when you're not engaged in activities is understandable. Can you tell me more about those moments when you feel lonely?

User: Well, when I'm in my room studying or just by myself, I sometimes feel overwhelmed with the loneliness and I miss my family a lot. It’s a bit hard to shake off those feelings.

Consultant: I can see how that would be tough, especially being away from home for the first time. Our emotions can really amplify when we’re alone. How do these feelings of loneliness affect your daily life and activities?

User: It makes it hard for me to concentrate on my studies. I find myself distracted and wanting to reach out to friends or family, but I don't always do it. 

Consultant: That’s a common reaction, Zhao. It’s challenging to focus when you’re feeling scattered by your emotions. Maybe we can explore how feeling connected in activities goes hand in hand with your studies. What feelings do you experience when you think about participating in group activities?

User: When I'm with others, I feel more energized and less worried. It’s like I forget about being lonely for a while. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! It seems like group activities provide a perfect distraction and a boost to your mood. Would you say these activities help shift your focus away from feelings of loneliness?

User: Absolutely! I'm a lot happier when I'm part of something, like the sports event. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems engaging with others is a great way for you to manage those feelings. How might you incorporate more group activities into your routine to maintain that positive state of mind?

User: I could join more clubs or volunteer for events. I just need to find what interests me.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Finding activities you enjoy will also help deepen your social connections. Let’s explore what kinds of clubs or events you might be interested in. What activities have you thought about joining or trying out?

User: I'm thinking about joining a dance club or maybe a study group. I always wanted to learn more about dancing!

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! Dance clubs can be a fantastic way to meet new people and express yourself. How do you think joining a dance club would affect your current feelings of loneliness?

User: I think it would help a lot! Being in a social environment while doing something fun could really lift my spirits.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Now, let's look at how you felt during the sports event. Can you recall some specific thoughts or feelings you experienced while volunteering?

User: I felt needed and excited when I was helping out. I loved being around everyone and working toward a common goal.

Consultant: Those feelings are incredibly valuable! It's important to recognize how positive engagement can create a sense of purpose. How can you keep that sense of purpose alive as you engage in other activities?

User: I could remind myself that being part of a team means my contributions matter. I want to continue fostering those feelings.

Consultant: That’s a great outlook! It might be helpful also to document those moments when you feel fulfilled and supported by others. How do you feel about keeping a journal of your experiences during these group activities?

User: I think that’s a good idea! Writing things down might help me process my feelings better.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be a powerful tool for reflection. You can track the positive feelings and any strategies that worked to manage loneliness. By reviewing these entries, you can reinforce those positive beliefs. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels good! Knowing I have strategies to deal with my feelings makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Zhao. Feeling more in control can significantly impact your overall well-being. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize some of the strategies you've identified. What stands out to you the most that you can utilize moving forward?

User: Joining clubs, keeping a journal, and remembering that I add value when I'm part of a team.

Consultant: These are all fantastic strategies! Remember that you’re not alone in this process, and it's perfectly okay to have ups and downs. In our next session, we can discuss how these strategies worked for you and adjust them as needed. Sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds great! Thank you for helping me see things more clearly.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhao! I’m glad to hear that. It’s been a pleasure discussing these insights with you today. Keep practicing those strategies, and I look forward to our next chat!
###################
Consultant: Hi Zhao! It's great to see you again. Today, I’d like to discuss how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What are your thoughts on your progress?

User: Hi! I feel like I've been adjusting quite well to university life. I still think of my parents a lot, but I can talk to them without feeling too anxious now.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant improvement! Being able to communicate with your parents more calmly is a wonderful step. What specific strategies do you think have helped you with this adjustment?

User: I think just recognizing that I’ll be okay has helped a lot. I’ve also been involving myself in group activities, which distracts me from feeling lonely.

User: I feel a lot more included, and it makes me forget about my worries for a while. It’s nice to bond with classmates over shared experiences.

Consultant: That’s great! These connections can really enhance your sense of belonging. Have there been any moments lately when you felt particularly proud of yourself for managing your feelings?

User: Yes, during a recent group project, I took the lead in organizing our tasks. It felt empowering to contribute and not just rely on others.

Consultant: Taking the lead is an excellent achievement! How did that experience impact your confidence?

User: It boosted my confidence quite a bit. I realized I can manage my responsibilities and interact with others without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That realization is powerful. It seems like you are recognizing your strengths. If you had to summarize the key skills you’ve learned during our sessions, what would they be?

User: I’ve learned to communicate better and how to self-soothe when I start feeling anxious. I also understand that it’s okay to seek help when needed.

Consultant: Those are fantastic skills! Acknowledging that seeking help is okay is crucial for your growth. Looking ahead, how do you plan to maintain this positive trajectory in your life?

User: I’d like to continue participating in activities and maybe even start a study group. Also, I want to keep reflecting on my feelings to ensure I stay balanced.

Consultant: Those sound like solid plans! Engaging in activities and maintaining self-reflection will surely help you stay grounded. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our discussions?

User: I think the biggest takeaway for me is understanding that I can adapt and grow. I’ve gained tools to handle my feelings, and that makes me feel more secure.

User: Yes, I feel ready! I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to navigate this journey, Zhao. This will be our last session, so remember everything you’ve learned and applied. You’ve come so far, and I’m proud of your progress. If you ever need support, you’re welcome to return anytime.
