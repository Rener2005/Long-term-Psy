Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to understand more about what you've been feeling lately. How are things going for you right now?

User: Hi. I'm feeling really lost and confused. I've just had this huge fight with my girlfriend where I lost control of my emotions and ended up hurting her. I don’t want to feel this way anymore, but I don’t know how to stop.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil and regret over what happened. It’s good that you’re reaching out for help. Can we start by discussing what led up to that moment for you?

User: Sure. We were arguing about my drinking habits. She was worried, and it just escalated. I know I have a problem, but it feels like I'm stuck in a cycle that I can’t escape.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It seems like there are a lot of overwhelming feelings tied to your drinking and the impact it has on your relationship. How do you typically feel before you reach that point of losing control?

User: I usually feel stressed and anxious about everything—work, money, my relationship. Drinking seems to be the only way I find relief, even if it's only temporary.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're using drinking as a way to cope with those stressful thoughts and feelings. Let’s try to pinpoint some of those automatic thoughts you have when you're feeling like that. What goes through your mind when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think, "I can't handle any of this," or "Everything is falling apart." It feels like I'm just a failure at everything.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, and it’s understandable that they would contribute to your feelings of helplessness. Can we examine how those thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: They make me feel really anxious and frustrated. Sometimes it leads to anger, especially when I think about my job situation and how I've let my girlfriend down.

Consultant: I'm hearing a lot of frustration and a sense of defeat in your words. It’s important to acknowledge that these feelings are valid. When you reflect on those thoughts and feelings, do you notice if they appear in specific patterns or situations?

User: Yeah, they hit me really hard when I'm drinking or after a fight. I realize they escalate the situation. But then, I also use drinking to escape those negative feelings.

Consultant: It looks like there's a cycle developing: feeling overwhelmed leads to negative thoughts, which drives you to drink for an escape, and then those thoughts return, leaving you more frustrated. How do you think we can begin to break that cycle?

User: I guess I need to find better ways to cope when I feel stressed instead of turning to alcohol. But it’s just so hard.

Consultant: Absolutely, recognizing that you want to change is a significant first step. Let’s explore some alternative coping mechanisms together. Have you tried other activities that might help when stress hits?

User: Not really—sometimes I try to exercise, but it's hard to stay motivated, especially when I'm feeling low.

Consultant: That’s understandable, especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed. What if we set small, manageable goals for you to start integrating some self-care practices, like a short walk or even a few minutes of deep breathing when you feel stress creeping in?

User: That sounds doable, but I'm worried I won't stick with it.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern, but remember that small changes can lead to bigger ones over time. How about we discuss a specific situation in the upcoming week where you could apply this? Maybe picking a particular time or trigger to experiment with?

User: I can try to go for a walk after I finish work. I often feel unproductive, so maybe a walk could help clear my head.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! A walk can serve as a reset for your mind. How do you feel about trying that and sharing your experience with it next time we meet?

User: I think I can do that. It gives me something to focus on instead of just drinking.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. And if you find it challenging, that’s okay too; we can figure it out together. So, let’s talk about your feelings about your drug use as well. How are you seeing it in your life right now?

User: I know it’s bad for me, but when I use, it feels like I can finally escape my problems. I know I need to quit, but I don’t see how I can.

Consultant: It’s valid to feel that way, especially when those substances seem to provide temporary relief. What might help is exploring how they affect you in the long term versus those short-term feelings of escape. Can we delve into that?

User: I guess using makes me feel good at the moment, but afterward, I usually feel worse—physically and emotionally. It’s like I’m just digging a deeper hole.

Consultant: Exactly. You’re recognizing the negative consequences that just compound your struggles over time. What do you think would be a motivating factor for you to start reducing your usage?

User: I want my girlfriend back and to feel better about myself. It’s just hard to imagine a life without those substances right now.

Consultant: That’s a powerful motivation. Wanting to stay connected with your girlfriend and improve your well-being can be strong reasons to consider change. Let’s work on strategies that tie into that motivation, helping you envision a life without substances, one small step at a time.

User: I guess picturing a better future might help. But it’s still overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when thinking about such significant changes. We can break it down—focusing on small, manageable steps you can take to move towards that vision. Would you be open to identifying one small change you can commit to in the coming week regarding both your drinking and drug use?

User: I think I could try to cut back on drinking during the week. Maybe I can set a limit for myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting a limit can empower you to take control. Let’s check in next time about how that goes, and how it felt to take that step toward a healthier relationship with alcohol. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I feel like I have something to work toward now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking things step by step. You’re not alone in this, and I'm here to support you through it. For now, let's reflect on the progress we made today. How are you feeling about the conversation we had?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, even though I know it's just the beginning. At least I have some ideas and steps to focus on.

Consultant: That's a positive realization! Acknowledging hope is a crucial part of change. Remember, every small step counts, and we’ll continue to build on that together. If any challenges come up, we can tackle them in our next session. You’re doing great by being here and opening up about everything.

User: Thank you. I appreciate that. I’ll try to keep this hope alive.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re making an important effort, and your commitment is what matters. If you need anything before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to hearing about your progress!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been going through a tough time. Can you tell me a bit more about how you're feeling and what's been happening lately?

User: Hi. I just feel lost. I know I need to stop using drugs and drinking, but every time I try, I end up back where I started. It's frustrating, and I feel like I'm letting everyone down, including myself.

Consultant: I can sense that you're feeling a lot of frustration and disappointment right now. It's understandable to have these feelings when you're trying to change something that's been part of your life for a while. What do you think is holding you back from making those changes?

User: I think it's the cravings, really. They hit me hard, and I just don't know how to deal with them. I want to stop, but when the urge hits, it's like I can't think straight anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like the cravings are really overwhelming for you. It’s good that you recognize that they are a challenge. Let’s explore that further. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt overwhelmed by cravings, and what thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: Yeah, just the other day, I was at home watching TV, and I suddenly thought about how good it would feel to have a drink. I convinced myself it was just a little, that it wouldn’t hurt. But it did, and I ended up using again.

Consultant: That must have been a really tough moment for you. It seems like in that moment, the thought of enjoying a drink became more convincing than the reasons you want to quit. How did that make you feel afterwards?

User: Honestly, it just made me feel more ashamed. Like I can't even control myself. It feels like I’m stuck in this cycle, and I don't know how to break it.

Consultant: Feeling ashamed and trapped can be incredibly heavy. It’s important to remember that many people experience similar struggles, and it doesn't define your worth. Let’s work together to identify those thoughts and see if we can find a way to challenge them. What do you think are some of the reasons that make you believe a drink or drugs will help in those moments?

User: I guess I think it'll help me relax. Life has been pretty stressful without a job, and my relationship is strained. It just feels like an easy escape.

Consultant: I understand that you see it as a way to cope with stress. A lot of people look for quick escapes when life feels overwhelming. But let's examine this idea a little more closely. What are some other ways you could potentially cope with stress that don't involve using substances?

User: I don't know. I've tried exercising before, but I never stick with it. Sometimes I go for walks, but it doesn’t feel like enough.

Consultant: It's great that you have thought about walking as an option. It's important to start small, especially since it can be hard to change established habits. How about we set a goal for you to take a short walk several times this week? It could be a starting point to relieve some of that stress without turning to substances.

User: I guess I could try that. A walk sounds easier than forcing myself to exercise, like running or going to the gym.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Starting small can lead to bigger changes over time. Over the next week, let’s also focus on identifying those moments when cravings hit. Perhaps you could keep a small journal and write down what you were doing, feeling, and thinking at those times. How does that sound?

User: It sounds okay, but I worry I won't remember to do it. Is there a way to make sure I actually follow through?

Consultant: Establishing a reminder might help! You could set an alarm on your phone to prompt you to journal at a specific time each day, maybe after your walk. Would that be manageable for you?

User: Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to remember to set the alarm.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If some days feel harder than others, that’s completely okay. Exploring your thoughts will give you more insight into your behavior. After this week, we can discuss what you’ve noticed. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a little hopeful, actually. I haven't really thought about it this way before. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Recognizing that there’s potential for change is important. With each small step, you'll build that momentum. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about what we've talked about so far?

User: No, this has been helpful. I like the idea of writing things down.

Consultant: Great to hear! It’s a tool that can provide you with clarity on your feelings and help you find patterns. Just remember to be patient with yourself as you navigate this process. We’re in this together. 

User: Thanks, I really appreciate your help. It's nice to finally have someone to talk to about all this.

Consultant: It's my pleasure! Opening up can be tough, and I'm here to support you. As we progress, if there’s ever anything specific you want to discuss or any concerns that arise, just let me know. 

User: I will. I’m really looking forward to next time. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful. Just remember, progress takes time, but you're taking steps in the right direction. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then! 

User: Thanks, take care! 

Consultant: Goodbye for now!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I’m glad you could join me today. I know we’ve talked about your journey before, and I’d like to hear how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Lately, I’ve been feeling really disappointed in myself. I tried to cut back on drugs, but when stress kicks in, it’s like I can’t help but relapse. I feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: I can see how frustrating that must be for you, especially after putting in effort to reduce your drug use. It sounds like you're feeling quite defeated. Can you tell me a bit more about what triggers that stress for you?

User: Well, I’ve been looking for jobs, but it’s tough. Not getting any responses makes me feel more hopeless. And then I just want to escape with drugs or alcohol.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Job searching can be really stressful and can impact your overall mood. So, when you face those rejections or lack of responses, it leads you to seek comfort in substances. Have you noticed any specific feelings or thoughts that come up just before you decide to use again?

User: Yeah, when I think about my future and the pressure of finding a job, I feel really anxious and overwhelmed. Then I just think, "What's the point?" and that leads me back to using.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a sense of hopelessness for you, which fuel your desire to escape. Let’s explore that a bit more. When you catch yourself thinking, "What's the point?" what do you think would be a healthier way to respond to those feelings?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that I’m trying my best and that setbacks are normal? But sometimes it feels so hard to believe that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Affirming your efforts and recognizing that setbacks can be part of the journey is a good step toward reframing those negative thoughts. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them in that moment of doubt?

User: I’d probably tell them to keep trying and not to give up. And remind them that they're not alone in this.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the capacity to offer support and kindness to others, and it’s important to extend that same compassion to yourself. Let’s think about creating a plan together to help you manage those moments when the stress feels overwhelming. What healthy activities could you incorporate when you feel the urge to use again?

User: I love sketching and playing basketball. I guess I could start doing those things more often when I feel stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can serve as a positive outlet for your feelings. How about we establish a schedule for those activities this week? 

User: Yeah, that would help. I think if I set specific times for those activities, it might keep me focused.

Consultant: I think that’s a solid approach. Let’s outline some times for sketching and basketball, and we can also think about moments when you might feel triggered. What do you think would be the best times to engage in these activities?

User: Probably after I finish job applications. I often feel drained afterwards, but maybe if I plan to go play basketball right after, it could help lift my spirits.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Incorporating sports right after those intense applications can definitely help clear your mind. We should also think about some strategies to deal with the potential cravings or triggers. Would you be open to discussing ways to manage those feelings in the moment?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful. I definitely need a better way to deal with those urges.

Consultant: Wonderful! One technique we could try is to create a “pause” strategy. When you feel those urges, take a moment to breathe and ask yourself what you’re truly feeling. You can also keep a list of positive affirmations or reminders of why you want to stay clean. What do you think of that approach?

User: I like the idea of pausing and checking in with myself. Keeping a list of reminders seems really useful too.

Consultant: Absolutely! This can help you gain clarity on your emotions before jumping into a reaction. It’s about creating that space to make more mindful choices. How does it make you feel to think about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Like there's a way to deal with my stress without going back to drugs.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Hope is an important part of healing. Let’s also touch on having a support system. Are there friends or family members you can lean on when you're feeling this way?

User: I do have a couple of friends who are supportive. I guess I could reach out to them more when I’m struggling.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Connecting with supportive people can make a significant difference. You’re not alone in this journey, and having that support can really help reinforce your commitment to change. How about we set a goal for you to contact one of your friends this week when you're feeling stressed?

User: I can do that. It would be nice to talk to someone who understands.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, sharing what you’re facing can greatly lighten the burden. Let’s wrap up today’s session by summarizing your plans moving forward. You’ll sketch and play basketball to cope with stress after job applications, practice the pause technique, and reach out to a friend. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds like a solid plan. I feel a lot better having talked this through.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve taken important steps today towards understanding and managing your feelings. Let's keep building on this progress. Remember, change takes time, but you’ve already shown that you have the strength to begin. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated now. I appreciate your help!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling hopeful lately. Participating in the support group has helped me a lot. I'm starting to see things differently regarding my issues with drugs and alcohol.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making some positive progress. Can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed that's different in your perspective?

User: I think I’ve begun to realize how much these substances have impacted my life negatively, and I want to make changes for the better. It's like I've been given a small glimpse of a healthier lifestyle.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing the effects of substances on your life. What are some changes you’re looking forward to making in your daily routine?

User: I want to cut back on drinking and find healthier ways to cope with stress. I’m also trying to be more social without relying on substances.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Building a more supportive and positive social environment is a great step. Have you had any experiences lately where you felt comfortable socializing without relying on alcohol or drugs?

User: Yes! I went out with some friends from the support group, and we just talked and had fun. It felt good to connect without needing to drink.

Consultant: That sounds like a rewarding experience! Feeling that connection can really reinforce your journey towards a healthier lifestyle. How did that experience make you feel about your social skills?

User: I felt more confident! I realized that I can have a good time without substances. It’s a relief to know that I don’t need them to enjoy myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, your confidence shines through! Building on this, let’s talk about strategies to maintain that confidence. What activities or coping strategies do you think could help you when you face stressful situations in the future?

User: I was thinking about trying some deep breathing exercises to calm myself down. Maybe I could also set goals to remind myself why I want to stay clean.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can help you manage anxiety when it arises, and setting goals reminds you of your purpose. How comfortable do you feel about practicing those breathing exercises?

User: I think I can manage that! I’ve heard that mindfulness helps, too. I might give that a shot.

Consultant: Mindfulness is a wonderful practice! It can help you stay present and reduce the urge to revert to old habits. How about we discuss a simple mindfulness technique you could try?

User: Sure! I’d like to learn more about that.

Consultant: One effective technique is the “5-4-3-2-1” method. You focus on your surroundings by identifying 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and finally, 1 thing you can taste. It helps ground you in the moment. Does this sound like something you could incorporate into your routine?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful! I can try it out when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, it’s all about practice. Each time you use these techniques, you're reinforcing your ability to manage stress. What other ways can you see yourself applying this new skill?

User: I could use it during social situations or when I feel overwhelmed. It might help me stay focused and calm.

Consultant: Exactly! Staying grounded can really support you during those challenging times. As we think about your progress, what do you feel has been your greatest achievement since starting this journey?

User: I think simply being able to enjoy time with friends without relying on substances is a huge win for me.

Consultant: That is indeed a monumental achievement! You're learning to find joy in genuine connections. As you move forward, how will you remind yourself of this accomplishment when faced with challenges?

User: I guess I could keep a journal. Writing down my feelings and successes might help motivate me.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful idea! It can serve as a powerful tool for reflection and motivation. What will be your first entry about your experiences so far?

User: I want to write about my recent outing with friends and how good it felt to connect with them without alcohol.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Capturing that positive experience will remind you of the joy and strength you have. As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway for you?

User: I feel more confident in my ability to resist temptation and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I’m excited for what’s next!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic outlook! Remember, you have the tools and support to continue on this path. I believe in you, and I'm here whenever you need guidance. Looking forward to our next session, and take care of yourself in the meantime!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well since our last session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident lately, but I still have those moments when I struggle. My relationship with my partner is a bit better, but it's still tense at times.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling more confident and that your relationship has seen some improvement. It's normal to experience struggles, especially with everything you're trying to manage. Can you share more about those moments when you feel you're struggling?

User: Well, there are times when I feel overwhelmed, and I think about turning to old habits. I worry about being tempted again, especially when life gets tough.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries, especially when it comes to your past habits. Let's take a closer look at what those overwhelming moments feel like. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you in those times?

User: I usually feel this anxious pressure, like I need something to help me cope. Sometimes, I think I won't be able to handle things without drinking or using drugs.

Consultant: That anxious pressure can be really challenging. I want to help you recognize those thoughts when they come up. When you think you can't handle things without substance use, what kind of emotions does that create for you?

User: It makes me feel hopeless and trapped. I think, “Here we go again; I’ll never really get out of this.” 

Consultant: Those feelings of hopelessness can be really heavy. Let’s explore that thought a bit more. When you think, “I’ll never really get out of this,” what evidence do you have to support that belief? Are there any moments that contradict it?

User: Well, I have been sober for a bit now. I’ve been going to support groups regularly, and I do feel different compared to before.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Recognizing your progress is important. It sounds like you've made substantial changes and developed new coping strategies. What other thoughts could you consider in place of feeling trapped?

User: Maybe I could think of this as a journey. Just because I have tough moments doesn’t mean I’m back at square one. 

Consultant: I love that perspective! Viewing this as a journey acknowledges both the challenges and growth. How might you remind yourself of your progress when difficult feelings arise?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal or something. I can write down what I've achieved and how I felt at different points.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a wonderful idea! It can serve as a tool for reflection and can help track your feelings over time. What kind of things do you think you’d like to write about?

User: I could write about my triggers, what helped me stay sober, and any positive experiences in my relationship. 

Consultant: That sounds great! Not only can it help you stay aware of your triggers, but it can also serve as a reminder of your resilience during tough times. Speaking of your relationship, how are things going with your partner at the moment?

User: We’ve been talking more and trying to understand each other better. It feels more open now, but sometimes I still don’t know how to handle certain situations.

Consultant: Communication is key, and it seems like you're making strides in that area. When situations get tense, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I often worry that I’ll say the wrong thing or that it’ll turn into an argument again. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern. What if you approached those situations with a mindset of curiosity instead of fear? What might that look like for you?

User: I could try asking how my partner feels instead of jumping to conclusions. I guess that could help avoid misunderstandings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Approaching with curiosity can foster understanding. Would you feel comfortable practicing this mindset during your next discussion with your partner?

User: Yeah, I think I could try that. It would be a new approach for me.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you experiment with new responses. What other strategies are you considering to maintain your sobriety moving forward?

User: I want to stay involved in my support group and maybe find some healthy hobbies to fill my time. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies! Engaging in activities you enjoy can create positive experiences and distract from temptations. What hobbies are you thinking of exploring?

User: I’ve always liked drawing and maybe picking up some sports again—it could keep me active and focused.

Consultant: Drawing and sports sound like excellent outlets for creativity and energy. They can also provide a sense of accomplishment. Do you feel excited about starting any of these activities?

User: Yes! I’ve been feeling inspired lately just thinking about it.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Maintaining that inspiration will be crucial. As we look towards our next sessions, let's plan to share some of your experiences with those hobbies and how your communication progresses with your partner.

User: Sounds good to me! I’m really looking forward to this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. It shows your motivation to embrace this journey. Before we wrap up, how would you summarize the key takeaways from today’s session?

User: I definitely want to keep track of my feelings and achievements. Plus, being open and curious in my relationship is important.

Consultant: Those are powerful insights! You’ve shown great growth today. Remember, you are capable of maintaining your sobriety and improving your relationship. If you ever face challenges, just recall these strategies we’ve discussed. 

User: Thank you for your support. I feel better equipped to deal with things now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Your progress is commendable. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like there have been some positive changes in your life recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi there. I feel pretty good! I've been making some efforts to stay sober, and I'm actually quite proud of myself. I hope to keep moving forward and not fall back into old habits.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made some significant strides. Could you share a bit more about what you’ve been doing that has helped you stay sober?

User: Sure! I've been trying to keep myself busy with different activities, like exercising and spending time with friends who support me. It feels good to be around positive influences.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really focusing on building a supportive environment for yourself. That’s an excellent strategy. How does it feel to engage in these activities compared to your earlier habits?

User: Honestly, it feels much better. I used to rely on alcohol and drugs to cope, but now I feel more in control. There are moments where I crave it, but I try to distract myself with something else.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’re finding healthier ways to cope. It must be empowering to feel more in control. When those cravings hit, what kind of distractions work best for you?

User: Uhm, I usually go for a run or call a friend. Sometimes I just watch a movie. I think I need to find more ideas to keep my mind off it.

Consultant: Those are all positive distractions! It’s important to have a variety of options available. We can brainstorm additional activities together, if you'd like. What kinds of activities do you enjoy or have you always wanted to try?

User: I’ve always wanted to learn how to play guitar. It seems fun, and I think it could be a great outlet for my emotions.

Consultant: Learning the guitar sounds like a fantastic idea! It can be a wonderful creative outlet. How do you think you might get started with that?

User: Maybe I could find some online tutorials or see if there are any local classes. I just need to commit to setting aside time for it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Committing some time to it can help you establish a routine. Setting small, achievable goals may also keep you motivated. How do you feel about setting a specific time each week to practice?

User: I think that would be helpful! Having a schedule might keep me accountable. I could try to practice twice a week. 

Consultant: Great! Two times a week can keep you engaged without overwhelming you. Besides the guitar, how do you feel about your relationships, especially with your partner?

User: Our relationship has been a bit rocky. I think my focus on sobriety is definitely affecting it, but I worry about how to approach it without it getting tense.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be concerned about that. Open communication can be very important. What are some ways you think you could start a conversation with your partner about how you’re feeling?

User: I think I could choose a calm moment and just be honest with them about how I'm trying to change and ask for their support. I want to show them that I'm serious about my sobriety.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach. Being honest and expressing your needs can really strengthen your connection. How do you feel about opening that dialogue with them?

User: I feel a little anxious about it, but I think it’s necessary. I want to be open, but I also don’t want to make things worse.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s natural to feel anxious before having difficult conversations. You might find it helpful to express your feelings in a non-accusatory manner. Something like, “I want to share my journey with you, and I hope for your support.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good. It feels less confrontational. I think I can manage that.

Consultant: I believe you can! Remember, it’s an opportunity for both of you to understand each other better. Reflecting on your progress, what strategies do you feel have been most effective for your mental well-being?

User: Keeping my mind occupied and staying physically active have been really important. It helps reduce the urge to use.
