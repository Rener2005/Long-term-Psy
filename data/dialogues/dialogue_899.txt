Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad to see you again today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel anxious and frustrated. I keep thinking about the recent job exams I didn't pass. It’s weighing heavily on me, and it's hard to focus on studying.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still carrying a lot of pressure from those experiences. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious, especially when facing disappointments. Can you tell me more about how these feelings have been affecting you day-to-day?

User: Well, I've been feeling very restless. I struggle to sit down and study, and my sleep hasn’t been great either. I often lie awake at night thinking about everything. Plus, I don’t have much of an appetite lately.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Wang. It's hard when anxiety affects your sleep and appetite as well. You mentioned feelings of disappointment—do you feel this disappointment is directed towards yourself, your situation, or maybe both?

User: I guess I feel disappointed in myself. I had high hopes for those exams, and now I worry about what my parents will think. I don’t want them to be disappointed in me.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about letting loved ones down, especially with parents, but it's important to remember that your worth isn’t solely determined by these exam results. Can we explore some specific thoughts you have when you think about these exams? What comes to your mind?

User: When I think about the exams, I often tell myself things like, "I'm not good enough," or "I'll never succeed." These thoughts really make me spiral.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and very critical. Let’s take a moment to examine them together. How much evidence do you think supports the belief that "I'm not good enough"? Are there contributions from your past successes or strengths that might contradict those thoughts?

User: I suppose I’ve done well in other subjects before, and I've managed to achieve some things. I just feel so overwhelmed right now.

Consultant: That's an important realization! You’ve had successes that show your abilities. Sometimes, anxiety can cloud our judgment, making us overlook our strengths. If a friend were in your situation, how would you advise them about their worth and abilities?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on what they can control and to not let one or two failures define them.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective. It shows you already have the tools to challenge those negative thoughts. Let's think about how you can apply that advice to yourself. What would happen if you allowed yourself to view your abilities more positively, despite the setbacks you've faced?

User: I guess it could help ease some of my anxiety and give me a little more confidence. But I wonder if it’s really possible to change the way I see things.

Consultant: It can definitely take time and practice, but it's possible. Change often starts with small steps. Would you like to try a little exercise together? We can challenge one of those negative thoughts and see how it feels to reframe it.

User: Sure, I’m willing to try. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take the thought "I’ll never succeed." What evidence do you have that could contradict this statement, even if it’s small?

User: Well, I did pass my courses, and I’ve had internships where I received positive feedback from my supervisors.

Consultant: Those are excellent pieces of evidence! They show that you are capable and have been successful in the past. Now, how could we rephrase "I’ll never succeed" to reflect a more balanced view?

User: Maybe something like, "I've faced challenges, but I can succeed if I keep trying"? 

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful reframe! It acknowledges the difficulties but reinforces your resilience and potential. How does that feel to say?

User: It feels a bit better. I like the idea of focusing on trying rather than just expecting perfection.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in thinking! Focusing on effort can help alleviate some pressure. Let’s talk about what small actions you can take to reinforce this new perspective. What small goal could you set for yourself in your studies this week?

User: Maybe I can start by creating a study schedule that includes short breaks. That might help me manage my time without feeling so overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Structuring your study time with breaks will help you stay focused and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about implementing that this week?

User: I feel good about it. I’m eager to try it out and see if it makes a difference.

Consultant: That's a positive attitude! Remember to be kind to yourself as you try this new approach. We can review how it went in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to address before we wrap up today?

User: I think I just want to remember this positive mindset. I hope I can maintain it.

Consultant: Absolutely, keeping that positive view in mind can make a difference. As we end today, let’s summarize: You’ve identified some negative thoughts, challenged them, and set a practical goal for the week. Those are real steps forward. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel hopeful. I know I have a lot to work on, but I can see a way forward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Take this hopeful feeling with you as you work on your goals. I look forward to hearing about your experience in our next session. Remember, it's perfectly okay to reach out if you need support before then. Take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! To be honest, I've been feeling even more anxious. With the interviews and exams coming up, I find myself doubting my abilities even more, and I can't focus on my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure with these upcoming challenges. Let’s talk about this anxiety—what specific thoughts are running through your mind when you think about the interviews and exams?

User: I keep thinking that I'm not going to perform well, that I won’t be able to answer the questions, or that I’ll mess up and everyone will see how unprepared I am.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It seems like they are contributing to your anxiety. Can you describe how these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and hopeless. It’s like I just freeze up when I try to study or prepare—it's hard to even start.

Consultant: Freezing up can be a tough reaction when you're feeling anxious. Let's break down these thoughts a bit. You mentioned that you might mess up—how likely do you think it is that that will happen?

User: I guess, logically, I know it's not very likely, since I've prepared, but when I'm anxious, it feels very real.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially when anxiety is high. What if we tried to find some evidence against that thought? Has there been a time when you performed well despite feeling anxious?

User: Yes, I did really well on a group project last semester, even though I was nervous during the presentation. 

Consultant: That's a great example! It seems you have succeeded in the past when you felt anxious. How does that experience shift your perspective on your capabilities now?

User: It makes me realize that I can handle pressure better than I think. But I still doubt whether I can perform well in an interview or exam setting.

Consultant: It's a positive realization! We can work on reframing those doubts into more constructive thoughts. What might be a more balanced or realistic way of thinking about your upcoming interview or exam based on your previous success?

User: Maybe I could think, “I have the ability to do well, and it’s okay to feel nervous. I can still prepare and give it my best shot.”

Consultant: That sounds much healthier! By reminding yourself that it's normal to feel nervous but that you can still succeed, you create a more supportive mindset. How do you feel about this new way of thinking?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds encouraging, but I’m still not sure if I can fully shake off the anxiety.

Consultant: It's okay to still feel some anxiety. Our goal is to manage it better rather than eliminate it completely. Let's talk about some practical ways to prepare for the exams and interviews. What actions can you take to build your confidence ahead of time?

User: I think I could make a study schedule and maybe do some mock interviews with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging in mock interviews can be especially helpful. What strategies can you implement in those sessions to help ease your anxiety?

User: I could focus on practicing common questions and maybe try relaxation techniques beforehand to calm down.

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing relaxation techniques can significantly reduce anxiety before those high-stress situations. Have you ever tried any relaxation techniques in the past?

User: Not really. I’ve heard of deep breathing and mindfulness, but I haven’t really used them.

Consultant: Both deep breathing and mindfulness are great strategies to manage anxiety. Would you like me to guide you through a brief deep breathing exercise right now?

User: Yes, that would be helpful.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’ll try.

Consultant: Great! Inhale… hold… and exhale. Let’s repeat that a few more times. How does it feel for you as we do this?

User: I feel a little more relaxed after that. It’s nice to just focus on my breathing.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Regularly practicing such exercises can really help when you're feeling overwhelmed. How can you incorporate this into your routine as you prepare?

User: I can make it a habit to do some deep breathing before studying or whenever I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Building positive habits can certainly help in reducing anxiety. As we continue our sessions, we can delve deeper into specific techniques that work best for you. 

User: Yes, I would like that. 

Consultant: Perfect! To wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ve learned. What do you think will be the most useful strategy for you moving forward?

User: I think changing my thoughts and practicing relaxation techniques will really help me before the interviews and exams.

Consultant: Those are indeed powerful tools! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Keep practicing, and I believe you’ll see improvement. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel more hopeful and equipped to face the upcoming challenges. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! You’ve made a lot of progress today. Remember to take things one step at a time, and I’m here for you every step of the way. I look forward to seeing you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm really glad you're here. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling lately? What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about my future. With graduation approaching and not being able to find a job yet, I feel lost and afraid. I also had some interviews that didn't go well, which made me feel even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot weighing on you right now, especially with your upcoming graduation and those interviews. It's completely normal to feel anxious in this situation. Can you tell me more about how these experiences have been affecting your day-to-day life?

User: Well, I’ve been struggling to focus on my studies lately. I can't even get myself to sit at my desk for long. And I haven’t been sleeping well either. I just keep thinking about how I might not find a job or how disappointing those interviews were.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the anxiety about job hunting is really impacting your ability to study and get restful sleep. Let’s talk about those thoughts that come up during these stressful moments. What kinds of things do you find yourself thinking when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think things like, “I’m never going to find a job” or “I’m not good enough for the positions I’m applying to.” It just spirals from there.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and very discouraging. Let's try to explore those beliefs together. What evidence do you see that supports these thoughts? And are there any counterexamples or moments where you’ve succeeded or felt capable?

User: I guess there were times when I performed well in school or projects, but it feels so distant now. I’m focusing on the rejections I’ve faced more than the accomplishments I had before.

Consultant: It's understandable to focus on the negative when facing rejection, but it sounds like you do have successes to reflect on. What if you could challenge those negative thoughts? For instance, if a friend faced similar setbacks, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s just part of the process and that they need to keep trying. I can see I’m not extending that kindness to myself.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It's often easier to offer compassion to others than to ourselves. Let’s work on incorporating some of that kindness into how you view your own efforts. How would you feel about coming up with some positive affirmations or reminders for yourself?

User: That sounds helpful. I think reminding myself of my past successes could build some confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can even create a small action plan together for how to integrate those reminders into your daily routine. Additionally, have you tried any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help manage your anxiety?

User: I haven’t really tried those. I’ve heard of them but didn’t think they would help me much.

Consultant: They may actually help more than you think! Relaxation techniques can be very effective in reducing anxiety. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises right now together? 

User: Sure, I’m willing to give it a shot.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on our breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... (pause) Now hold that breath for a moment... (pause) and slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six... (pause). How are you feeling after this exercise?

User: I feel a little calmer. It’s nice to just focus on my breath for a moment.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Whenever those anxious thoughts begin to overwhelm you, returning to your breath can be a helpful tool. Let’s talk about some concrete steps you can take to maintain this calmness throughout your day. What activities do you enjoy that could help you unwind?

User: I like reading and going for walks, but I haven’t been doing much of those lately.

Consultant: Those are great activities! Let’s schedule specific times each week for you to enjoy reading or walking. It’s important to create space for things that uplift you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I actually feel excited about the possibility of making time for those things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s about small steps toward feeling better. Now, regarding your job search, how would you feel about reaching out to classmates or professors for advice and connections?

User: I’ve been hesitant to do that, but I know it could help. I just feel embarrassed about my situation.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, but reaching out can provide you with valuable support and insights. Remember, many of your classmates and professors are there to help. Let’s brainstorm how you might approach them. What could you say to initiate those conversations?

User: I could start by asking for their thoughts on my resume or if they know of any openings. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Yes, that sounds very manageable and proactive! It’s a smart way to not only get feedback but also to open the door for potential opportunities. How about we summarize what we’ve discussed today and set a goal for your next steps?

User: Sure! I want to start practicing breathing exercises daily, reframe my negative thoughts, schedule reading and walking time, and reach out for support regarding job opportunities.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are actionable steps that can really help you improve your mindset and emotional regulation. Always remember, it’s a process, and seeking support is a strong move forward. How are you feeling about everything we talked about today?

User: I feel lighter, like I have a plan now. I’m more hopeful about taking these steps.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Taking those steps will definitely help build your confidence and emotional resilience. I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Whenever you feel ready for our next session to check in on your progress and discuss anything new that comes up, just let me know!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. It feels good to have someone to talk to about all this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this journey. Take care, and I look forward to our next chat!
###################
Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but I still find it challenging to interact with classmates when discussing job opportunities. I want to improve my communication skills.

Consultant: That's great to hear you're feeling a bit better! Improving your communication skills is a great goal. Can you share a specific situation where you felt it was hard to communicate with your classmates about job opportunities?

User: Well, during a recent group study, I wanted to ask my classmates for advice on my job applications, but I hesitated. I was worried they might judge me for not having enough experience.

Consultant: I see. You're concerned about being judged because of your experience. That's a common feeling. What thoughts went through your mind in that moment?

User: I kept thinking, "What if they think I'm not qualified?" or "Maybe they won't take me seriously." These thoughts really held me back.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts made it difficult for you to express yourself. Let’s explore them a bit more—did those thoughts end up turning into feelings of anxiety?

User: Yes, definitely! I felt anxious and just ended up staying quiet. I didn’t want to feel embarrassed.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s tough to feel embarrassed, and that anxiety can keep you from reaching out. If a friend were in your situation, how would you feel about their concerns?

User: I would likely tell them that everyone has to start somewhere and that it's okay to ask for help.

Consultant: That's very supportive of you! So, how might you apply that same perspective to yourself? 

User: Maybe I should remind myself that it's normal to ask for help and that others might appreciate my questions.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great shift in thinking. It can be really helpful to challenge those negative thoughts. What do you think would happen if you tried to reach out to your classmates next time?

User: I think they might respond positively because we're all in the same situation of looking for jobs.

Consultant: Yes, and that could help build connections! Let's practice a scenario where you approach a classmate for advice. How would you start that conversation?

User: I could say something like, "Hey, have you gotten any good tips for job hunting lately? I could really use some advice."

Consultant: That sounds like a solid start! It's casual and invites them to share. How would that make you feel while saying it?

User: I think it would make me feel nervous, but also a bit excited because it means I'm taking a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a brave approach! It’s understandable to feel nervous, but excitement can also be a great motivator. Would you be willing to try this conversation with a classmate before our next session?

User: Yes, I think I can try to have that conversation this week!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's all about taking that first step. Remember, every small action counts. When we meet next, we can talk about how it went and what you learned from the experience.

User: I'm looking forward to that! It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Also, aside from approaching your classmates, are there resources within your university that can help you improve your job skills or networking?

User: I believe there are workshops and seminars on career development. I should look into those.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in those workshops can boost your confidence and provide you with more strategies for job hunting. How do you feel about taking that initiative?

User: I feel motivated to participate. It could be a good opportunity to practice my skills.

Consultant: Exactly! It can also help you meet others in the same situation, who you can share your experiences with. When you attend, keep a positive mindset and look for opportunities to connect.

User: I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for the encouragement!

Consultant: Of course! You’re doing really well. Remember that every step you take helps you grow. When we chat next time, we can celebrate your progress and discuss any challenges you faced.

User: That sounds great! I’m excited to share my experience.

Consultant: Me too, Wang! Your willingness to engage and improve is truly inspiring. Don't hesitate to reach out for support in the meantime. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing all about your conversations and any new developments in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you today for our session. Before we start, can you share how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement. I've realized I need to focus more on improving my professional skills. It's a bit overwhelming, though. I want to ensure I can find a good job after graduation.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling determined to improve your skills, even if it feels overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what specific skills you think you need to enhance, and what led you to this realization?

User: I think I need to improve my programming skills and perhaps some soft skills like communication and teamwork. When I tried applying for jobs, I felt inadequate compared to others. I want to feel more prepared.

Consultant: Feeling inadequate can be really tough, especially when you're comparing yourself to others. Let's break this down. What specific programming skills or projects have you thought about working on first?

User: I know I should be more comfortable with Python since it's widely used. I've also thought about taking some online courses to improve my knowledge on teamwork and collaboration.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Identifying Python as a skill to focus on is a great start. Have you looked into any online courses yet? And how do you feel about taking those courses?

User: I found a few Python courses, which seem interesting, but I’m worried I might not keep up with the workload. I often get anxious when I think of balancing study and job searching.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about balancing multiple responsibilities, especially during this transition. What do you think would help you manage your time better while taking those courses?

User: Maybe I could create a schedule to allocate specific times for studying and job searching. But I’m not sure how realistic that would be.

Consultant: Planning a schedule is a great approach! It can help you visualize your time and commitments. How about starting with small, manageable time blocks for studying? You can adjust as needed once you see how it feels.

User: That sounds manageable. If I could set aside some focused study time a few times a week, it might help. I would need to see how it balances with everything else.

Consultant: Absolutely! Start small, and you can build from there. How about we set some specific goals for your study sessions? What do you think would be a reasonable goal for your first week?

User: Maybe I could aim for three 1-hour sessions focused on Python and one session on soft skills. That feels achievable, I think!

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Setting it up that way makes it more achievable and less daunting. How do you feel about holding yourself accountable for these sessions? 

User: I think sharing my goals with someone might help. If I have someone checking in on me, it would encourage me to stay on track.

Consultant: That's a smart idea! Accountability can be very motivating. Do you have a friend or a classmate who could support you in this way?

User: Yes, I have a friend who's also looking for jobs, and she mentioned wanting to improve her skills too. We could hold each other accountable!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic partnership! Having someone to encourage each other can really make a difference. Let's also talk about how you can manage any anxiety during this process. What coping strategies have you used when feeling overwhelmed before?

User: I usually try to take a break and do things I enjoy, like reading or going for walks. But sometimes, it's hard to really relax.

Consultant: Taking breaks for activities you enjoy is a great strategy! It might also help to incorporate some mindfulness exercises or short breathing techniques when you start feeling anxious. Have you tried any mindfulness practices before?

User: I haven't really practiced mindfulness, but I’ve heard about it. I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: No problem! Mindfulness can start with simple practices like focusing on your breath for a few minutes. I can guide you through a basic technique if you're interested.

User: I would love that! I think that could help me calm down when I feel overwhelmed, especially with studying and job searching.

Consultant: Great! Let's try a simple breathing exercise together. Just find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose. Hold it for a moment, and then slowly let it out through your mouth. Let’s repeat this a few times. How does it feel?

User: It feels calming. I definitely need more moments like this when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating short moments like this into your daily routine can really help manage anxiety. Now, as we prepare to wrap up today's session, how are you feeling about your plan moving forward?

User: I feel more confident. Having a clear plan for my studies and knowing I have someone to support me makes a big difference.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you’ve set a realistic plan, and you’re not alone in this. Before our next session, try to keep track of how your study sessions are going and how you're feeling overall. 

User: I will! I’m looking forward to updating you on my progress.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing your updates. You've made great strides today. Keep believing in yourself, and I’m here whenever you need support. Have a great week ahead, Wang!

User: Thank you so much! I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The internship is going well, and I'm slowly getting used to the work environment. My mood and sleep have improved too.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're adapting to the new rhythm of life and feeling more confident about the future. What specific changes have you noticed in your daily routine?

User: I think I'm more organized now. I keep track of my tasks better, and I’m feeling less overwhelmed, although there are still moments when I doubt myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you're finding ways to stay organized. Doubts are normal, especially when adjusting to a new job. Can you tell me more about the moments when you feel uncertain?

User: Sometimes I worry about whether I'm meeting expectations at work. I strive for perfection, so even small mistakes can leave me feeling anxious.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel anxious about meeting high standards. Let's explore those feelings a bit deeper. When you make a mistake, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I've disappointed my supervisor, or that I might get fired. It feels like every mistake could jeopardize my position.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense. It's understandable to want to do well at your job, but let's consider how valid those beliefs are. Do you have evidence that making mistakes will lead to such severe consequences?

User: Not really. I mean, everyone makes mistakes, right? But I just can't shake that fear.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone makes mistakes, and they can actually be valuable learning experiences. What would you say to a friend who felt the same way about their job performance?

User: I would tell them to focus on what they did well and learn from their mistakes. That it’s part of growing.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It seems that you can offer understanding to others, but not to yourself. How might you apply that same supportive mindset to your own experiences at work?

User: I suppose I could try to reflect on my accomplishments more instead of fixating on the negatives. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy! Perhaps you could keep a journal where you note down your successes, no matter how small. How does that feel to you?

User: It sounds helpful! I think writing it down could serve as a reminder of my progress.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re open to that idea. This practice could help shift your focus from fear of failure to celebrating your growth. Are there other practices or activities that help you manage anxiety?

User: I’ve started practicing mindfulness a bit, including meditation. It helps, but I still forget to do it when I'm busy.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be incredibly beneficial. Perhaps we could set a goal to incorporate even just a few minutes of mindfulness into your daily routine? What do you think?

User: That sounds reasonable. Even a short session could help calm my mind.

Consultant: Great! What specific time of day do you think would work best for you to practice mindfulness?

User: Maybe in the morning before I start work. It would set a positive tone for the day.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Establishing a morning routine may provide you with a refreshing start. Is there anything else on your mind that you would like to discuss today?

User: I also want to think about my career path after graduation. It feels daunting to start looking for jobs.

Consultant: It's normal to feel overwhelmed about job searching. Let’s explore your career interests and what steps you might take to navigate that process. What fields are you considering?

User: I’m really interested in data analysis, but I’m not sure I have enough skills yet.

Consultant: Skills can always be developed! Have you thought about any specific steps you could take to build your expertise in data analysis?

User: Maybe I could take an online course or find projects to join. I just worry about managing time alongside my internship.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you’re thinking about active steps! Time management can be challenging, especially with an internship. Would you be open to creating a balanced schedule that accommodates both your work and learning?

User: Yes, I think having a schedule could help me feel less stressed about fitting everything in.

Consultant: Perfect! Creating a plan will help you feel more in control. Before we end today's session, let's summarize what we've discussed and the actions you want to take moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ll start a journal to record my successes, incorporate mindfulness in the mornings, and create a balanced schedule for learning data analysis.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful plan, Wang! You’re focusing on your strengths and finding a healthy balance in your life. Don’t forget that it’s okay to reach out if you feel the anxiety creeping back in. 

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about everything now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember to celebrate your progress, and I look forward to hearing about how things are going in our next session. Take care!
