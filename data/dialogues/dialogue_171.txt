Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I understand you've been feeling a bit lost regarding your future and college choices. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling confused about my future lately. After talking to my relative, I started to think about which direction I should take. It’s overwhelming. I just don't know what I really want to do.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that conversation sparked a lot of reflections for you. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming? 

User: Well, I keep comparing myself to others. They seem to have their plans figured out, while I'm just here, unsure of what I want. I’m feeling a bit down about it. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaojing. It’s natural to feel pressured when it seems like everyone else has their future mapped out. What thoughts come to your mind when you feel this pressure? 

User: I often think I might not be good enough or that I will disappoint my parents if I don't choose the right path. It makes me anxious and unhappy. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty heavy. It's understandable to worry about disappointing your parents, but I wonder, how accurate do you think those thoughts are? 

User: I think they might not be completely true, but the fear feels real to me. It’s hard to shake off those doubts. 

Consultant: It makes sense that those doubts linger, especially when they are tied to your feelings about your family. Let's try to challenge those thoughts a bit. Can you think of any evidence that suggests you are good enough, regardless of your choices? 

User: Sometimes, when I do well in my studies, I feel proud of myself. My teachers have also complimented me. But then, I just forget all those positives when I feel confused.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize those moments of success and acknowledgment. Maybe we can keep a reminder of them. How do you feel about creating a list of your strengths and accomplishments to refer back to when those negative thoughts arise? 

User: That might help! It can be a good way to remember my capabilities. 

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Remembering your accomplishments can help combat those negative thoughts. Now, let's talk about your interests. What subjects or activities make you feel excited or fulfilled?

User: I really enjoy biology, but I also like art. I feel torn between pursuing something in the sciences or going into a creative field. 

Consultant: It’s completely okay to have diverse interests! Have you thought about ways to combine those interests, like exploring fields that integrate biology and creativity? 

User: I haven’t really thought about that. That could be interesting, like bio-design or something related to environmental art. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic direction! Exploring interdisciplinary fields can lead to exciting opportunities. Let's brainstorm a few more ideas on how you might explore these interests further. What step could you take to learn more about those areas? 

User: Maybe I could look into workshops or online courses? I could also talk to someone in the field. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas, Xiaojing! Seeking out workshops and talking to professionals can provide you with insight into those fields. What’s your first step in pursuing this exploration? 

User: I suppose I could start looking for online courses this week. I’ll also prepare some questions to ask if I manage to talk to someone in the field. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking small steps can make exploring those interests less overwhelming. How do you feel about taking these steps? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It's nice to have concrete things to look into rather than just feeling lost. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! This is a positive shift. Just remember, it’s perfectly normal to be uncertain, especially at your age. Each step will bring you closer to clarity. What are you most excited to learn about next? 

User: I’m curious about how to integrate my interests! I think there’s a lot to explore. 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Curiosity will guide you as you navigate your path. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect on this session. What are the main takeaways for you today? 

User: I think I realized that it’s okay to be uncertain and that I can explore a mix of my interests. Writing down my accomplishments is also a good idea to boost my confidence. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful insights! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’re already on a good path, and I'm here to support you along the way. 

User: Thank you! This session has been really helpful. I feel more motivated to explore. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re ready to take. Remember to keep tracking your thoughts and feelings. I look forward to our next session. Take care, Xiaojing! 

User: Thank you! I will!

Consultant: Hello, Jing! It's great to see you today. I understand you've been exploring your interests and how they align with your current studies. How are you feeling about that process?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite confused, actually. I recently took some assessments, and they indicated that my interests don’t really match my current science track. I'm not sure what to do now.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a significant crossroads, weighing your interests against your current academic path. What specific interests are you discovering that stand out to you?

User: I found out that I really enjoy art and creative activities, which feels so different from my science classes. It's really confusing for me.

Consultant: Exploring a passion for art while being on a science track can create a lot of inner conflict. How do you feel when you think about pursuing art more seriously?

User: I feel excited when I think about art, but also scared. It feels risky to change my focus, especially since I've spent so much time in science.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel both excitement and fear when considering a change. It means this is important to you. Let’s explore this a bit deeper—what fears come up for you when you think about shifting to focus more on art?

User: I'm worried that I won't be successful in art, and I'm also concerned about what my parents will think. They really value academic achievements.

Consultant: It seems like your concerns about success and parental expectations weigh heavily on your mind. What evidence do you have that pursuing art might not lead to success?

User: I suppose I don’t have concrete evidence. It’s more just what I’ve heard from people about how difficult it can be to make a living from art.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It's often said that pursuing one's passion can lead to fulfillment, even if the path isn’t straightforward. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them?

User: I think I would tell them to go for what they love and that it’s okay to take risks. But I’m not sure I can follow that advice for myself.

Consultant: It’s common to give sound advice to others but feel differently about our own situations. What if we looked at it as an experiment? What small steps could you take to explore art without completely giving up your current studies?

User: Maybe I could take an art class outside of school or start a small project just for fun. That doesn’t seem too scary.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Starting with something fun and manageable can help ease your fears. What kind of art projects or classes are you interested in?

User: I’ve always wanted to try painting and maybe some digital art as well. It could be really enjoyable.

Consultant: Painting and digital art could be great ways to express yourself! How do you think pursuing these interests could impact your feelings about your current studies?

User: I think it might relieve some of the pressure I feel. If I have a creative outlet, I might feel less stressed about school.

Consultant: That’s an insightful connection! It seems that nurturing your creative side could provide balance in your life. What specific steps can you commit to taking this week?

User: I’ll look up some local art classes and maybe sign up for one. Also, I can start painting at home.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps, Jing! As you embark on this journey, how do you feel about your ability to combine these interests?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. It seems possible to have both science and art in my life.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling! As we continue this exploration, it might also be helpful to ponder how you can communicate your passion for art to your family. What do you think they would value about your interests?

User: I think they care most about my happiness. Maybe if I show them my art and how it makes me feel, they would understand.

Consultant: That's a lovely approach! Sharing your experiences can help them see what's important to you. How do you envision that conversation going?

User: I would probably share what I’ve created and explain how it helps me. I hope they would be supportive.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful way to engage with them. As you think about this, what’s one positive belief you can hold on to as you navigate this transition?

User: I believe that pursuing what I love is worth the effort, even if it means stepping outside of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That's an empowering belief to adopt! As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I feel I have a clearer understanding of how to explore my interests without abandoning my studies. I can take small steps towards both science and art.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Jing! I’m proud of your willingness to explore this duality. As you move forward, remember that these small steps can lead to significant growth. We can reconnect next time to discuss how things have evolved.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve been exploring some art classes and it feels great to discover my potential in that area, but I still worry about completely switching away from science.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive development, and it's completely natural to have those feelings of uncertainty. Can you share more about what you've enjoyed in the art classes?

User: I really enjoy painting and creating things. It feels liberating and makes me happy. But I keep thinking, “What if I’m not good enough at it?” or “What if I regret leaving science?”

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those doubts, especially since you’ve invested a lot of time in your science studies. Let’s explore those thoughts a little deeper. What specific evidence do you have that makes you question your abilities in art?

User: Well, sometimes I feel my work isn’t as good as what other students produce. I also remember struggling in art classes when I was younger.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s common to compare ourselves to others, especially in a creative field. But let me ask—if a friend shared those same concerns about their art, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them to keep practicing and that everyone improves over time. I wouldn’t want them to give up just because of a few setbacks.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you already know the right mindset to have about art. Let's try to shift that perspective onto yourself. What if you approached your art practice with the same encouragement you would give a friend?

User: I suppose that makes sense. I really do want to keep trying and see where it can take me.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! As part of this exploration, how about setting small goals to engage with art more regularly? What kind of projects or activities could you try out?

User: Maybe I could join more art workshops or even start a personal project at home. That sounds exciting!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Engaging in those activities might help solidify your passion for art. What challenges do you think you might face as you start working on these projects?

User: I might feel anxious about the quality of my work or worry that people won’t like it. 

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common, and we can address them together. Would you be open to trying a small experiment where you share your art with trusted friends or family, regardless of how you perceive its quality?

User: That could be a bit scary, but I think it’s a good idea. Getting feedback might help me grow.

Consultant: Exactly! Feedback can be incredibly helpful for growth. Before our next session, I encourage you to complete one or two of these art activities and share your creations with someone you trust. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness, but I’m willing to give it a try!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, this is all part of the process. Reflect on how you feel after sharing your work—what were the reactions like, and how did it affect your feelings about your artistry?

User: I’ll definitely do that. It feels encouraging to think about these next steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Our goal here is to help you feel more confident in your choices and direction. As we move forward, let’s continue examining both your interests and your mindset towards changing your focus. How do you feel about continuing this discussion in our next session?

User: That sounds good! I want to delve deeper into my feelings about switching paths.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can explore that more thoroughly. For now, focus on those art activities and be kind to yourself. I believe you'll surprise yourself with the progress you can make!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you throughout this journey. Remember, it’s okay to move at your own pace. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Me too! I’ll work on my projects and see where this takes me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach, Xiaojing. Enjoy the creative process, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next meeting.

User: I will, thank you! I feel much better about everything now.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that. Have a great time exploring your creativity, and we'll catch up soon!

User: See you next time!

Consultant: Take care! Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I know we've been discussing your academic transition, and your confidence has improved. How have you been feeling about your plans recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better! It's like I finally see a light in my future. Talking with my mentor made me realize that I can actually change my academic direction, and that feels empowering.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're excited about taking control of your learning path. Could you share more about what specific steps you're considering for this transition?

User: Well, I think I want to shift from a pure science focus to something more applied, maybe social sciences or education. I feel passionate about that, but I'm not sure how to officially make the shift.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've identified a passion! Transitioning can be challenging. What do you feel are the main steps you need to take to begin this change?

User: I think I need to research the programs and subjects that interest me, and maybe talk to more people who are in those fields to get their insights.

Consultant: Researching and connecting with others in those fields sounds like a solid plan! How do you feel about setting some specific goals around that?

User: Setting goals sounds good. I guess I could aim to find and speak with at least three people in the next month. That seems manageable.

Consultant: Absolutely, starting with three conversations is a great target. How do you imagine these conversations could shape your view on this new direction?

User: I hope to gain a clearer understanding of what studying those subjects would really be like, and hopefully build my confidence to commit to this path.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Collecting that information can definitely help solidify your choice. Are there any concerns you have about committing to this new direction?

User: I worry that it might not be what I expect. What if I change my mind later or struggle to keep up?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those concerns. Let's explore that fear together. What evidence do you have that changing your mind would be a negative outcome?

User: Well, I guess it would mean I wasted time or effort... but isn't that true?

Consultant: Not necessarily. Every experience can lead to personal growth and learning. Could you think of it as a way to explore your interests rather than as a waste?

User: I suppose that makes sense. If I do find something I don’t like, at least I'll know for sure and have tried it.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all part of the learning process. You've already shown courage in considering this change. Let's also talk about how to maintain your motivation during this transition. What strategies do you think might help?

User: I could set smaller milestones for myself and celebrate each one when I achieve it. That would keep me motivated.

Consultant: Celebrating milestones is a fantastic strategy! Do you have any particular ways you'd like to reward yourself?

User: Maybe treating myself to something I enjoy, like a nice meal or a day out with friends. 

Consultant: That sounds delightful! Combining these rewards with your progress can create a positive feedback loop. Now, about any challenges you might foresee—what potential hurdles do you think you could face in this transition?

User: I might face some self-doubt. Sometimes, I question whether I'm capable of succeeding in a new field.

Consultant: Self-doubt is quite common, especially during transitions. Let’s try to reframe those thoughts. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way?

User: I would tell them they are capable and remind them of their strengths. 

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! You have strengths too. Could you list a few of your strengths to counter any self-doubt you might experience?

User: I’m a good learner, and I’ve always been determined once I set my mind to something.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths that will serve you well. We can keep referring back to these as affirmations during your journey. As we continue forward, what support would you like me to provide in our upcoming sessions?

User: I think I would like to keep discussing my progress and any new challenges that come up. It feels reassuring to have someone to talk things through with.

Consultant: I'm here for you, and we can definitely focus on your progression together. As our time today comes to a close, can we take a moment to reflect on what you've learned about your goals and feelings today?

User: Sure! I feel more empowered to pursue what I want. I have a clearer action plan and ways to deal with feelings of self-doubt.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You've made great strides today. As we wrap up, let’s think about how you can maintain this positive momentum. What might help you remember this feeling moving forward?

User: I can write down my goals and remind myself of the strengths I listed. Maybe I’ll also keep a journal of my journey.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a wonderful idea! It can serve as a powerful tool for reflection. I'm proud of all the progress you've made, Xiaojing. Remember that you can always reach out if you need support again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this time, and I feel a lot more hopeful about my future now.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaojing! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel more confident and positive lately. I'm really happy with my decision to switch to a course that interests me. But I still have some lingering thoughts about the future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you feel more confident! It's completely normal to have thoughts about the future, especially with new changes. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you?

User: Well, sometimes I wonder if I'm really making the right choice. What if I don't succeed in this new direction? It's just hard to shake off those doubts.

Consultant: It's understandable to have doubts about your choices. Recognizing these feelings is an important step. How do these doubts impact your daily life or your motivation toward your studies?

User: Sometimes, they make me hesitant to put in my best effort. I catch myself thinking, “What if it doesn’t work out?” And then I don’t study as much as I should.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are creating a bit of a barrier for you. Let’s explore that thought—what evidence do you have that this new direction might not work out for you?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. It’s mostly just fear of failing. But it feels so real at the moment.

Consultant: Fear can feel very real and overwhelming. If a friend came to you with the same fear, what would you say to them? 

User: I’d probably tell them to keep trying and not give up on what they enjoy. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You believe in persistence and enjoying the journey. How can you apply that same encouragement to yourself in this situation?

User: I suppose I should remind myself more often that it’s okay to try and not be perfect. It’s part of learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing the process rather than focusing solely on the outcome can relieve a lot of pressure. What steps can you take to reinforce this mindset moving forward? 

User: Maybe I can set small goals for myself in my studies, so I feel more accomplished and less overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Setting small, achievable goals can lead to greater confidence. What kind of small goals do you think you could start with?

User: I could aim to complete one topic each week in my new subjects. That way, I won't feel rushed, and I can actually enjoy learning.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Enjoying the learning process will definitely enhance your experience. Have you thought about how you might track your progress with those goals?

User: I hadn’t, but I could use a planner or maybe just a simple checklist to see what I’ve accomplished weekly.

Consultant: A planner or checklist is a great idea! It can help you visualize your growth and celebrate your successes. How do you feel about putting this plan into action?

User: I feel excited! It feels like I’m taking control of my learning instead of letting fear hold me back. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Taking control is empowering. Is there anything else you’d like to reflect on from our sessions that could help solidify your progress?

User: I think I’ve learned a lot about how to challenge my negative thoughts and be more kind to myself. I don’t want to forget that.

Consultant: That’s a valuable takeaway! Remembering to be kind to yourself is crucial for long-term success. How can you remind yourself to practice this kindness when self-doubt arises? 

User: I could write down affirmations or encouraging phrases that I can look at whenever I doubt myself. 

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful tool! Having those affirmations handy can make a difference. As we wrap up today's session, what do you feel you’ve accomplished in our time together?

User: I feel like I’ve better understood my feelings and have some solid strategies to keep moving forward positively. I’ve made great progress.

Consultant: You truly have! It’s empowering to see how far you've come and how you plan to keep growing. As you encounter future challenges, remember these strategies and confidence you've built. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more prepared for what’s ahead. I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've done an amazing job. Remember, you can always come back if you need more support in the future. Take care, Xiaojing!

User: Bye! I will. Thank you!
