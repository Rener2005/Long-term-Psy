Consultant: Hello Xiaomi! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of anxiety and tension. It seems like I'm constantly worried about my performance in class and about my mom's expectations. It's overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds quite difficult, especially with the pressure from class and home. Can you share more about what specific thoughts or worries are making you feel this way?

User: Well, I often think that if I don't get perfect scores, my mom will be disappointed, and that makes me really anxious. It's like I can't face her afterward.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to feel anxious about disappointing someone you care about. Can you think of any instances where this worry about your performance has affected you recently?

User: Yes, during a recent math test, I froze up and couldn't think clearly. I was so afraid of not meeting my mom’s expectations that I just panicked.

Consultant: It’s tough to deal with that kind of pressure, especially in a crucial moment. When you panicked, what thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking, "If I fail this, it will be the end of the world." It felt like so much was riding on that one test.

Consultant: That’s an intense thought, suggesting that one test could define your worth or future. Let’s explore this belief together: how likely is it that failing one test will truly have such drastic consequences?

User: I guess it's not as drastic as I think it is. I could always try again, but in the moment, it feels so real.

Consultant: Exactly. In the moment, it feels overwhelming, but looking at it from a broader perspective can help mitigate that fear. Are there any alternative thoughts you can replace that extreme view with when you feel anxious about a test?

User: Maybe I could think about how I’ve done well in the past, or remind myself that one test doesn’t define my entire ability.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Reminding yourself of past successes can help create a more balanced view. How do you feel about using this approach the next time you’re faced with similar anxiety?

User: I think it could help. I just need to remember to do it in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a good plan. Practicing this will take time, but it can make a big difference. Now, let’s shift to how your home environment affects these feelings. How do you think your relationship with your mom influences your anxiety about school?

User: My mom has really high expectations, and sometimes she doesn’t listen to how I feel about them. It makes me feel like I can’t share my struggles with her.

Consultant: It must feel isolating to carry that weight alone. Have you had a chance to talk to her about how her expectations impact you?

User: Not really. I’m scared of how she might react. I feel like she wouldn’t understand or might get upset.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be apprehensive about that conversation. What do you think might happen if you gently express your feelings to her?

User: I hope she would listen, but I also fear she might just dismiss my worries as me being lazy or not trying hard enough.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a fear of being misunderstood. Let’s consider, what if you approached her by focusing on how you feel rather than what is expected? For example, saying, “I feel anxious when I think about tests,” instead of framing it around expectations.

User: That might help! It could make it feel less confrontational.

Consultant: Absolutely, sharing your feelings can foster understanding. How do you feel about practicing that approach with her?

User: I think I could try it. I just hope it goes well.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re open to trying this. Remember, even if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly, it’s a step toward communication. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today regarding your feelings about school or home?

User: I feel like the tension in our house is pretty high, especially when my mom gets upset over things. It feels like I’m walking on eggshells around her sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful. It’s challenging to deal with that kind of environment. Have you found anything that helps you cope when things feel tense at home?

User: I usually just go to my room and try to distract myself with music or my phone, but it doesn’t really fix anything.

Consultant: While distraction can provide temporary relief, it’s important to also address your feelings. One technique we can discuss is grounding or relaxation exercises that can help alleviate that tension when you start feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to learn about that?

User: Yes, that sounds useful. I’d like to try something to calm down more effectively.

Consultant: Great! One technique is deep breathing. It's simple but can be powerful. When you feel anxious, you can take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale for a count of four. It redirects your focus and calms your nervous system. How does that sound?

User: I think I can handle that. I’ll give it a try when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a perfect approach! Consistent practice will help it become a go-to method for calming yourself down. Remember, it’s about finding what works best for you. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Understanding more about my thoughts and having some techniques to try makes me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Recognizing your thoughts and having ways to cope are essential steps. Remember, it's okay to still feel anxious, but you now have tools to help manage it. If you find yourself struggling, don’t hesitate to remind yourself what we talked about. I look forward to our next session. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed?

User: I feel better. I’ll definitely try to communicate with my mom and practice the breathing techniques.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I'm here for you, and remember, progress is a journey. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty anxious, especially when I'm in class. I really worry about what my teachers and classmates think of me, and I feel a lot of pressure from my mom's expectations.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the anxiety about classroom performance and your mom's expectations is really weighing on you. Can you share more about what's been happening in class lately?

User: Well, I've been too scared to participate in discussions. I keep thinking that if I say something wrong, everyone will judge me. It makes me feel really small and overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Feeling judged can be quite overwhelming. What thoughts do you usually have in those moments when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I think things like, "If I speak up, I'll embarrass myself," or "Everyone will think I'm stupid." These thoughts just make me freeze.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense, and it's understandable to feel anxious in that situation. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. How true do you think they are, really? Do you have any evidence that supports those beliefs?

User: I guess I don't have actual proof that people think negatively of me. It might just be how I'm feeling at the moment. But it feels so real!

Consultant: It's interesting to hear you say that. It sounds like there's a difference between how you feel and the actual evidence of what others think. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think about those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and just to focus on doing their best.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! If you could apply that advice to yourself, what might change in how you view your participation in class?

User: Maybe I wouldn't feel so scared to raise my hand. I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! Mistakes are a natural part of learning. What if we tried to write down some of those positive thoughts to counter your anxious ones? This could help you remember them when you feel that anxiety.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think having a reminder would help me a lot.

Consultant: Great! Let's create a few affirmations together that focus on your capabilities. How about something like, "It's okay to make mistakes; they are part of my learning"?

User: Yes, I like that! I could also say, "My worth isn't defined by others' opinions."

Consultant: Exactly! Those affirmations can help reframe your mindset. How do you feel about using those when you start to feel anxious in class?

User: I feel a bit excited! It feels empowering to have something positive to tell myself instead of letting the anxiety take over.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We can also think about some small steps for you to gradually participate more in class. What’s a manageable action you could take this week?

User: Maybe I could try answering one question in class, even if it’s just a simple one. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect step! It’s manageable and will help you build confidence. After you try it, we can discuss how it went in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’m a bit nervous, but I feel like I can do it.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, and it shows you’re stepping out of your comfort zone! Remember, each small effort counts. How about we also create a journal entry for you to reflect on how that makes you feel?

User: I like that idea! Journaling could help me track my progress and emotions.

Consultant: Absolutely. Reflecting on your experiences can be really beneficial. What else do you think you might want to write about this week?

User: I could write about any times I feel pressured or anxious, and also try to note any moments I feel proud of myself. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Noting the positives will be crucial in shifting your focus. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you want to discuss today?

User: I just hope I can remember these strategies when I really need them. I tend to forget in the moment.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to forget under stress. You could keep your affirmations and strategies written down and read them before class. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds like a good backup! I’ll definitely try that.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, this is a journey, and it’s all about progress, not perfection. I’m proud of you for taking these steps. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support and advice.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomi! I believe in your ability to manage this. If you find yourself struggling, remember these techniques, and we’ll address any concerns in our next session. See you next time!

User: See you! I’m looking forward to it!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit anxious, especially during classes. Whenever the teacher looks at me, I feel this intense pressure and it makes me really nervous.

Consultant: I can understand how uncomfortable that must feel. It sounds like the teacher's attention triggers your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to say something wrong or that everyone will judge me if I do. It feels like all eyes are on me, and I can't handle it.

Consultant: That sounds overwhelming, feeling like you're under such scrutiny. It's normal to fear judgment, especially in a classroom setting. Let's explore that thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that everyone is judging you negatively?

User: Well, I don't have any solid evidence, but it just feels like it. I worry that if I say something wrong, they will laugh at me or think I’m stupid.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you might feel this way, but it seems like this thought might be a bit extreme. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about such a concern?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that nobody is perfect, but it’s hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective to have! It’s important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it doesn’t define who you are. Let's try to challenge that thought about being judged. Can we come up with an alternative thought that feels more balanced?

User: Maybe I could think that even if I make a mistake, it's a chance to learn and others might appreciate my efforts.

Consultant: That's a fantastic alternative! Shifting your focus from perfection to growth can help reduce that tension. Have you had any moments recently where you felt more comfortable speaking up in class?

User: I did answer a question once, and it wasn't perfect, but I didn't feel as anxious as usual. I was really surprised.

Consultant: That’s an excellent opportunity to build on! It shows you can manage your anxiety in certain situations. Let's think about gradually facing those classroom moments more often. How would you feel about practicing speaking up in an environment where you feel safe first?

User: I think that could work. Maybe I could practice with my friends before trying in class.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing in a safe space can build your confidence. We can also incorporate some relaxation techniques to help you calm your nerves before you speak. Would you be willing to try some relaxation exercises together?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, then exhale through your mouth for a count of four. We can do this a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I like taking that moment to just breathe.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating this kind of breathing before speaking can help you center yourself and reduce anxiety. Let’s commit to practicing this before you answer in class or even with your friends.

User: I can do that. I’ll try to practice breathing before speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As you practice this, pay attention to how your feelings might change. When you feel prepared, we can also gradually introduce those classroom scenarios. 

User: I think I can handle that. It makes me feel a bit better just talking about it.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you feel this way. Remember, you’re not alone in this; many students feel the same. What other strategies do you think might help you during class?

User: Maybe I can focus on the question instead of on the people watching me. That might help me concentrate better.

Consultant: Focusing on the content rather than the audience is an excellent strategy! It shifts your attention to something constructive. Another technique could be visualizing a positive outcome—what would that look like for you?

User: I could see myself answering confidently and feeling proud afterward instead of worrying.

Consultant: That’s a powerful visualization! Allowing yourself to imagine success helps create a positive expectation. Can you practice this visualization before class or even during moments of anxiety?

User: I think so. Visualizing could give me confidence.

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating visualization along with relaxation techniques can significantly enhance your confidence levels. As we move forward, let’s track how these practices impact your experiences in class.

User: I will definitely keep track. It feels good to have some tools to work with.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! As we conclude today's session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and planned. You have strategies like alternative thinking, relaxation techniques, and visualization to help you face classroom challenges. 

User: Yes, I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: You’re making great progress, Xiaomi! Remember, it’s a journey, and every step forward counts. Let’s meet next time to see how these strategies worked for you in practice. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: You’re welcome! You’re doing a fantastic job, and I believe in your ability to navigate this. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more open during group activities at school. I participated in some club events and even made a few new friends. But sometimes, I still feel a bit hesitant around my parents.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your progress with the group activities! It sounds like you're gaining some confidence and developing a sense of belonging. Could you share more about how those interactions make you feel?

User: It's nice to feel accepted, but I often find myself worrying about what my parents expect from me. I feel pressure to meet their standards, which sometimes makes me anxious.

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to feel that way when you have high expectations from family. Let’s explore this pressure you’re experiencing from your parents. What specific expectations do you feel are weighing on you?

User: My mom is quite strict about my grades and how I behave. I feel like I have to be perfect all the time, or I disappoint her.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. Feeling like you have to be perfect can create a lot of anxiety. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you think about disappointing your mom?

User: I think that if I fail or make a mistake, she will be really upset with me. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you care about your parents’ opinions. Let’s reflect a bit—are there specific moments where you felt this pressure most intensely?

User: Yes. Last week, I didn’t do as well on a math test as I wanted. When I told my mom, she seemed disappointed even though she didn’t say it directly. It made me feel really bad.

Consultant: That sounds tough, and it’s okay to feel hurt by that. It’s important to remember that one test doesn’t define your worth. Could we challenge that thought about not being good enough? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that belief?

User: Well, I did well in other subjects, and I’ve been working hard. But I still judge myself harshly for the failures.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize your hard work in other areas! Let’s try to replace that harsh judgment with a kinder perspective. If a friend was in your situation, how might you encourage them to view their performance?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that one test doesn’t define who they are.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! Now, let’s see if we can apply that same kindness to yourself. How might you reframe your thoughts after a challenging test to be more supportive?

User: I could think about all the effort I put into studying and remind myself that I'm still learning and improving.

Consultant: That sounds much healthier and more realistic. Remember, learning is a process, and it's okay to stumble along the way. As you continue to build these positive thoughts, how could this impact your interactions with your mom?

User: I guess if I feel more confident about my abilities, I might be less afraid to talk to her about my struggles.

Consultant: Absolutely! And that confidence can help improve your communication with her. Let’s focus on how you can express your feelings to your mom. What do you think would be a good way to start that conversation?

User: I might tell her that I find math challenging and that I’m trying my best. It might help to explain my feelings about the pressure.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiaomi! Sharing your feelings can invite understanding and foster better communication. How do you feel about practicing expressing those feelings right now?

User: I think that would help. I could start by saying, “Mom, I really want to do well, but I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the pressure.”

Consultant: Great start! Let’s role-play that conversation a bit, and we can adjust it if needed. You can share your thoughts, and I’ll respond as if I were your mom. Ready?

User: Sure! “Mom, I really want to do well, but I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the pressure.” 

Consultant: “I understand, sweetie. I want the best for you, but I also want you to feel happy. How can we work together on this?” 

User: Okay, I could say, “It would help me if we could focus on my efforts instead of just grades.”

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to encourage a more supportive dialogue. How does practicing this make you feel about talking to your mom in the future?

User: I feel a bit more confident. It helps to have a plan in mind.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, practicing these conversations can ease your nerves. Before we conclude, let’s discuss some strategies you can use to remind yourself of your strengths when you face challenges in the future.

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my achievements and positive feedback from teachers and friends.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Keeping a record of your successes will help reinforce positive thoughts when negative ones creep in. Let’s plan to discuss your experiences next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Me too, Xiaomi! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep focusing on those positive thoughts, and remember that you’re doing your best. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just take a deep breath and reflect on how far you've come. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! Until next time, take care, and I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! I’m glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about improving communication in your family. How have things been since then?

User: Hi! It's been better, actually. I had a conversation with my mom about my studies, and it felt more peaceful than before. I think I'm becoming more open with her.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in communicating with your mom. How did that conversation go? What was different this time?

User: Well, I expressed my feelings more openly, and she listened. We talked about my old school and the pressure I felt, and she didn't react as harshly as before.

Consultant: It's great that your mom was receptive. It seems like you were able to share your feelings, which is a crucial step in improving communication. How did that make you feel?

User: I felt relieved and less anxious after talking. I didn't expect her to understand me so well.

Consultant: Feeling relieved is a positive sign! It shows that you are becoming more comfortable expressing yourself. Do you think this change in your conversation style could help in future discussions with her?

User: Yes, I hope so. I want to keep having open conversations like that, but I sometimes still feel a bit anxious before talking to her.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxiety before important conversations. Would you like to explore some ways to manage that anxiety before speaking with your mom?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to feel more confident.

Consultant: One technique we could try is identifying your automatic thoughts before these conversations. What thoughts come to your mind when you feel anxious about talking to her?

User: I often think that she won't understand me or that she'll get upset with me for expressing my feelings.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. Let’s examine them. Is there evidence to support those beliefs? Have there been times when she surprised you by being understanding?

User: Actually, yes. The last conversation went much better than I thought it would. I guess I was just worried about how she would react.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It seems like the outcomes of your conversations have been more positive than you initially expected. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them about their worries?

User: I would probably tell them to be brave and to just speak their mind. Things might not be as bad as they think.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s excellent advice. By thinking about how you’d advise a friend, you can apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you tried reminding yourself of this supportive perspective when you feel anxious before talking to your mom?

User: I like that idea. I think I could write it down to remind myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy! Writing it down can help reinforce that mindset. How about we also consider specific communication techniques you can use with your mom, like “I” statements when expressing your feelings? How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think using “I” statements would help me communicate better without sounding accusatory.

Consultant: Absolutely! For example, instead of saying, "You don’t listen to me," you could say, "I feel unheard when I try to express my thoughts." This helps in reducing defensiveness. Would you like to practice together?

User: Sure! That sounds helpful.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s say something you’d like to express to your mom about your studies. How could you frame it using an “I” statement?

User: I could say something like, "I feel overwhelmed with the pressure to perform well in school."

Consultant: That’s a great start, Xiaomi! You’re expressing your feelings clearly. How do you think your mom might respond to that?

User: I think she might be more understanding since I’m sharing my feelings instead of blaming her for the pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! This approach invites dialogue rather than defensiveness. As you practice this, you’ll likely find that communication improves further. What other situations do you think you’d like to apply these skills in?

User: I think I can use it when discussing my social life too, like when I want to go out with friends and she’s worried about my studies.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s important to balance your social activities with your academic responsibilities. Let’s plan for your next conversations with her. What would be your immediate goal for your next discussion?

User: I want to communicate my need for social time while assuring her that I’ll manage my studies.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Combining your feelings and responsibilities in a respectful way will foster mutual understanding. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you've made in your communication skills?

User: I feel really positive! I think I’m ready to keep working on this and looking forward to more conversations with my mom.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaomi! It’s impressive to see your growth. Remember to apply the techniques we discussed, and keep practicing those “I” statements. Would you like to set some goals for maintaining this progress?

User: Yes! I want to have at least one open conversation with my mom each week.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Setting specific times for these conversations can help you stay committed. I believe in your ability to continue developing these important skills. If you need further guidance, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help so much.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been wonderful working with you. Stay positive and remember how far you’ve come. I look forward to hearing about your future conversations. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiaomi! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing really well, actually. I've managed to keep my anxiety levels low, and I feel more excited about school activities.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some great progress. Can you share more about what has been helping you maintain this positive mindset?

User: Well, I've been spending more time with my friends at school, and that has made me feel less lonely. We're getting closer, and I feel more comfortable participating in class activities.

Consultant: It's great that you're building those friendships and feeling more connected. Social support can play a big role in managing emotions. How do you feel when you engage in these activities with your friends?

User: I feel happy and less anxious. I used to worry a lot about making mistakes or what others might think of me, but now I just enjoy the moment.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! It sounds like you’re learning to appreciate the present rather than focusing on potential worries. Have you noticed any changes in how you handle stressful situations at school?

User: Yes! I've started to take deep breaths when I feel overwhelmed. It really helps to calm my nerves.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy—breathing techniques can be very effective in managing anxiety. As we continue today, how about we evaluate the progress you've made and discuss some long-term strategies for keeping this positive momentum?

User: That sounds good to me. I want to make sure I don't go back to feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s start by reviewing what specific achievements you're most proud of since we last spoke. What do you think stands out the most?

User: I think the biggest thing is that I'm more involved in my classes and group projects. I've even volunteered to lead a project!

Consultant: Leading a project is an exciting challenge! It shows a lot of growth in your confidence. How has this experience been for you so far?

User: A bit nerve-wracking at first, but I realized that my classmates are supportive. It feels nice to contribute and share ideas.

Consultant: That support from your classmates is vital. It sounds like you’ve created a positive environment for yourself. Have you considered how you can keep this supportive circle around you as you continue to grow?

User: I think I should keep inviting my friends to study together and participate in activities. That way, I can maintain our bond.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Keeping those connections strong can help you feel supported during challenging times. Are there any other strategies you think could help you manage your emotions and social skills further?

User: Maybe I could also talk to my mom more about my day. She always has good advice, even if she can be a bit strict sometimes.

Consultant: Opening up that line of communication with your mom could be beneficial. It can also provide you with additional support at home. How do you plan to approach this conversation with her?

User: I think I’ll just start by sharing something fun or interesting that happened at school. That might make her more relaxed and open to chatting.

Consultant: That's a smart approach! It can help to ease into a conversation. Let’s reflect on what we've discussed today—how would you summarize your progress and what steps you aim to take moving forward?

User: I've improved my friendship skills and learned to manage my anxiety better. I want to keep being involved in school and strengthen my relationship with my mom.

Consultant: Fantastic summary! You've outlined a clear path forward. As we wrap up, let's think about how to prevent slipping back into old habits. What strategies will you keep in mind for the future?

User: I’ll remember to breathe when I feel anxious and reach out to friends for support. I’ll also make sure to talk to my mom regularly.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. You’ve shown amazing self-awareness and determination throughout our sessions. I'm proud of the progress you've made. If you ever find yourself needing help again, remember that I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more equipped to handle challenges now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could assist you on this journey. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future.

User: I will! Thank you again for everything. Bye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiaomi! Take care and stay positive!
