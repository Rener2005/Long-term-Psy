Consultant: Hello Zhang Wei, I'm glad to meet with you today. Before we begin, I want you to know that this is a safe space where we can talk openly. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I haven't been doing well at all. Losing my home has made everything feel hopeless. I can't see a way out of this situation, and it just makes me feel more and more depressed.

Consultant: I can hear how overwhelming this situation feels for you. It's understandable to feel hopeless when you're experiencing such significant challenges. Can you tell me more about your feelings over the past few weeks?

User: It's just constant sadness. I feel like I have no one to turn to, and being out on the streets is heartbreaking. I sometimes think about how easy it would be to just end it all.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It’s important that we talk about those thoughts and the pain you're experiencing. Have there been specific moments lately when these feelings intensified for you?

User: Yes, especially at night when I'm alone. That's when it hits me the hardest. I miss having a home, a place that felt safe.

Consultant: That sense of safety and belonging is crucial, and losing it can lead to deep feelings of isolation. When you think about your situation, what thoughts go through your mind that might contribute to these feelings of sadness and hopelessness?

User: I often think that I’m a failure. I should have done better, and now look where I am. It’s like I can't escape this cycle of negative thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being very hard on yourself. That inner voice can be quite critical. What if we explored some of those thoughts together? Are there specific thoughts that come to you when you feel like a failure?

User: I think about how I didn't save enough money and how my life choices led me to this point. Sometimes I just tell myself that I deserve this situation.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It’s concerning that you believe you deserve this hardship. Let's challenge that thought together. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the idea that you deserve to suffer like this?

User: I guess there have been times when I’ve tried my best. I worked hard to find a job before all of this happened. But it just feels like nothing matters anymore.

Consultant: You’ve shown resilience by trying your best in the past, which highlights your strength. It's important to remember that external circumstances don’t define your worth. Let’s explore how you can start shifting those negative thoughts. What alternative view could you adopt when those feelings of inadequacy arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that many people go through tough times and it doesn’t make them failures. But honestly, it's hard to hold onto that thought.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be challenging to shift our mindset, especially when we’re feeling low. Let's think about some steps you could take when these thoughts come up. How about setting small goals or tasks to focus on, even if they seem minor?

User: I could try that. Maybe just cleaning up my sleeping area a bit or finding a local shelter. That feels achievable.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Taking small, manageable steps can create a sense of accomplishment and help break that cycle of negative thinking. Would you feel comfortable committing to those actions for the coming days?

User: Yes, I could try that. It might help to have a plan, even a little one, to focus on instead of just sitting with hopelessness.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you feel that way. Creating structure can help reclaim a sense of control. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. How do you think you may feel when you accomplish even these small tasks?

User: I think it might make me feel slightly better, like I’m not completely lost. But I’m also worried I won’t be able to stick to it.

Consultant: That concern is valid, and it’s important to be gentle with yourself. Instead of aiming for perfection, consider celebrating small victories along the way, no matter how minor they may seem. Could we explore some ways to build that commitment into your daily routine?

User: Sure, I could set reminders on my phone to help me remember. Just little prompts to encourage me to act.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! These reminders can be positive nudges to motivate you. Additionally, keep in mind that it’s perfectly okay to seek support if you feel overwhelmed. Is there someone you trust that you could reach out to during tougher moments?

User: I think I’ve pushed everyone away. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems. But maybe I could speak to my social worker again.

Consultant: Reaching out to your social worker sounds like a great step. They are there to provide support, and sharing your feelings can lighten your emotional load. Remember, you are not a burden. How do you feel about speaking with them again?

User: I guess it’s a good idea. I tend to feel embarrassed, but it might help to talk again.

Consultant: It’s totally understandable to feel that way. Trying again can create a connection that helps you feel less isolated. Do you have any other thoughts on what we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less alone. It has been helpful to talk things out and consider practical steps. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Zhang Wei. Remember, your feelings are valid, and it’s a journey to work through them. As you take these small steps, I believe you will start to see positive changes. For our next session, let’s talk more about the outcomes of your steps and how you felt about reaching out to your social worker. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I appreciate the support and the space to express myself.

Consultant: You're very welcome. It's my pleasure to support you. Let's continue this journey together, and take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm really glad to see you again. I know you've been going through a difficult time recently. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty lost and alone. Trying to reach out to my family didn't pan out, and that made everything worse. I keep thinking about how isolated I am.

Consultant: It sounds like that attempt to connect didn't go as you hoped, which has deepened your feelings of isolation. Let's explore these feelings of loss a bit more. What thoughts or emotions come up when you think about your family and this experience?

User: I guess it just makes me feel worthless. I thought maybe they could help me, but now I feel even more abandoned. It’s like I'm stuck in this dark place with no way out.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling abandoned can be incredibly painful, and it sounds like you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness. Can you share more about what specific thoughts go through your mind in moments like this? 

User: I think that if my family doesn’t want to be in my life, maybe I’m not worth loving at all. It feels like no one cares.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings can distort how we perceive ourselves and our value. Have you ever considered how these thoughts might not reflect the whole truth about you?

User: I know I should think differently, but it's hard. When I'm in this dark place, it's like those thoughts take over and drown out anything positive.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be really hard to challenge those negative thoughts. Let’s try something out: can you recall a time when someone showed they cared about you, even if it feels distant now? 

User: Well, I had a friend who was supportive during college. We used to talk a lot, but we lost touch after graduation. 

Consultant: That's a good memory to hold onto. Even though that connection has faded, it shows that you are capable of being supported by others. What if you reached out to that friend again? How would that make you feel?

User: I don't know... I feel like it’s been so long. They might not care about me anymore.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel apprehensive about reconnecting. But remember, relationships can evolve over time, and reaching out might surprise you. What do you think could be the worst-case scenario, and how would you cope with that?

User: The worst-case scenario is that they ignore me. I guess I would just feel even more alone. But I could try to focus on other things... maybe some hobbies?

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy coping strategy. Engaging in hobbies can provide a distraction and potentially lead to meeting new people who share similar interests. What hobbies or activities have you considered that you might enjoy?

User: I've always liked drawing, but I haven't done it in a while. I feel like I could unwind by getting back into that.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself and find some peace. It can also serve as a channel to explore your emotions. How would you feel about setting aside some time each week to focus on this activity?

User: That could be nice. I think I could manage an hour here and there. It feels less daunting than everything else going on.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're considering making time for something that makes you happy. Small steps like this can make a big difference in how you feel. How are you feeling about taking this step toward reconnecting with your interests?

User: I feel a little hopeful, actually. Focusing on drawing might help take my mind off things.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! It’s important to create these small moments of joy. As we continue to address your feelings of isolation, let's think about other potential sources of support. Are there community groups or activities you could explore? 

User: I haven’t really thought about community groups. Maybe I could find a local art club or something. 

Consultant: That sounds like a promising idea! Joining a club could help you meet new people with similar interests, which might lessen your feelings of loneliness. What do you think would be the first step in looking for such a group?

User: I might start by searching online for art clubs in my area. It seems like a good way to start connecting with people.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a practical first step. It could be a way to not only pursue your interests but also build connections. How does it feel to think about actively seeking out these opportunities?

User: It feels a bit empowering, actually. I’ve just been stuck feeling sorry for myself, and this makes me feel like I can take back some control.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Taking control of your circumstances can bring a sense of empowerment. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. What do you feel are the next steps you’d like to take before our next session?

User: I’ll look for some art groups and set aside time to draw. I’ll also try to be more open about reaching out to people. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent steps. It’s important to be gentle with yourself throughout this process. Before we end today’s session, let’s summarize what you’re feeling right now and any strategies you'll carry forward.

User: I feel a bit lighter after talking. I want to focus on my drawing and see if I can reconnect with my friend or find a group. It all feels more doable now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made some positive decisions today, and I believe you’re on the right path toward finding connections and support. Remember, I’m here to help you through this process. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care and keep focusing on those positive steps.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I’m glad you’re here today. Let's take a moment to check in about how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, things haven’t improved much. I’m still grappling with the uncertainty of living on the streets. It feels like there’s no way out, and it’s exhausting.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling that weight of uncertainty every day. It’s completely understandable to feel exhausted. Have there been any moments recently where you felt a bit of relief or comfort, even briefly?

User: There was one day when I found a quiet park to sit in, and it felt nice to just be away from the crowds for a while. But it didn't last long.

Consultant: Finding that quiet space sounds like it brought you a little peace, which is important. It’s great you were able to experience some relief, even if just for a moment. How about your feelings of hope? Have you been able to hold onto any sense of hope amidst these challenges?

User: Honestly, my hope feels quite dim right now. I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard when I can't find stable accommodation. 

Consultant: I can really hear how searching for stability feels overwhelming. It's okay to have those feelings. Let's explore that hope a bit more. What does hope look like for you, and what might you need to feel a bit more hopeful?

User: I guess hope for me would mean finding a place to stay, some security. It would also help if I felt more connected to others, not just stuck on my own.

Consultant: Seeking security and connection is very natural. Building connections can play a huge role in how we perceive our own worth and stability. Have you considered any resources or activities in your community that might help foster those connections?

User: Not really. I’ve mostly been focused on just getting through the day. I don’t really know what’s out there or who to reach out to.

Consultant: It makes sense that focusing on survival has taken priority. Exploring community resources can feel daunting. How about if we brainstorm together? We can think of specific actions that might feel achievable to you. 

User: That sounds okay. I guess I could start by looking for local shelters or community centers. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Finding shelters or community centers can be great ways to meet people and receive support. What do you think about setting a small goal to check out a couple of these resources this week?

User: I think I can do that. It feels better to have something I can focus on that isn’t just about survival.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Zhang Wei. Focusing on something proactive can often lift our spirits. Once you explore these options, how would you like to evaluate how you feel afterward?

User: Maybe I could journal about my experiences? See how connecting with others affects me?

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic way to process your feelings and reflect on your experiences! It can help you recognize any positive changes in your emotions. When you think about this week, is there anything else contributing to your sense of being overwhelmed?

User: Just the constant uncertainty. Each day feels like a fight just to find basic needs, and that creates a lot of stress.

Consultant: That constant stress can certainly take a toll. How do you currently cope when those overwhelming feelings arise?

User: I try to breathe and distract myself, but it doesn’t feel like enough sometimes.

Consultant: Deep breathing and distraction are valuable tools, and it’s understandable that they may not always feel sufficient. You might consider integrating some activities that bring you joy or relaxation into your routine. What are some activities that once brought you happiness?

User: I used to love drawing and writing. It always helped me to express myself.

Consultant: Those are wonderful outlets for expression! It might be worth exploring some time for drawing or writing again. Even if it feels small, these activities can significantly impact your emotional well-being. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds encouraging. I’ll definitely try to make time for it. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Engaging with your passions can truly support your mental health. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. It sounds like you have some positive steps planned with connecting to the community and reigniting your creative passions.

User: Yes, I feel better about having a plan. It feels good to talk about these things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've demonstrated such resilience. Remember, taking small steps towards those connections can build a sense of support and hope over time. If you keep applying what we discussed, you may notice some positive shifts. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate the support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang Wei! I’m here to help, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, it’s okay to take things one day at a time, and I believe in your strength. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had some positive experiences recently. Can you share more about how you're feeling and what’s been going on in your life?

User: Hi! Yes, I have been feeling a bit better since I started my temporary volunteer position. It feels good to be recognized for my contributions, and I think I'm starting to regain some confidence. But I still struggle with the idea of whether I truly belong.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’re experiencing some improvement! Feeling recognized can indeed boost confidence. Let’s explore this sense of belonging a bit more. What does belonging feel like to you, and in which situations do you feel it the most?

User: Belonging feels like being accepted for who I am. When I’m with others during the volunteering activities, I sometimes feel that connection, but I often doubt if I actually fit in. It’s like I’m just pretending to be a part of the group.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those doubts. You’re not alone in feeling that way, especially when trying to connect with others. Can you recall a specific moment during your volunteering where you felt a sense of connection or belonging? What were you doing at that time?

User: There was this one day when I helped organize a community event, and I received a lot of positive feedback from the team. It made me feel valued, even though later, I questioned if they really appreciated me or if they were just being kind.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful experience! It’s great to hear you felt valued, even if doubts crept in afterward. Let’s examine those thoughts—what evidence do you have that they were just being kind as opposed to genuinely appreciating your efforts?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just a habit of thinking that I don’t truly earn others' respect, you know?

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you might be caught in a pattern of negative thinking about your self-worth. Let’s challenge that thought. If a friend shared a similar concern with you, what would you advise them? 

User: I would probably tell them that if people compliment you, there has to be some truth in it. Maybe they do appreciate your work, and you shouldn’t undermine your own value.

Consultant: That’s a powerful perspective! It seems you have the insight to recognize the value in others but find it hard to see it in yourself. What might happen if you choose to believe in the compliments you receive rather than doubting them?

User: I suppose if I believed that, I might feel more confident and open to forming connections with others. It could really change how I approach things.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing those positive thoughts can help break that cycle of doubt. Let’s talk about your volunteering experience again. What activities or interactions made you feel proud or happy? 

User: When I was interacting with the community members, I felt they appreciated my help, especially when I was able to answer their questions. It felt nice to be useful to someone.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Feeling useful can greatly enhance our sense of worth. How could you incorporate more of those interactions into your routine to strengthen this feeling of usefulness and connection?

User: Maybe I could suggest more community outreach activities? I feel like I could help more people, and it might allow me to engage more with the other volunteers.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant idea, Zhang Wei! Taking initiative could not only make a positive impact but also help deepen your connections. What steps can you take to bring this idea to life?

User: I could talk to my coordinator about organizing more outreach programs and share my enthusiasm for connecting with the community.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Taking that step could lead to not only building connections but also enhancing your own sense of purpose. How do you feel about taking action on this idea?

User: I feel excited about it! I also feel a bit nervous because what if they don’t support the idea? But I guess I can’t control their response.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel nervous; it shows you care about the outcome. Remember, regardless of their response, you’re taking a step to create opportunities for yourself and others. How about we reflect on possible positive outcomes and what you might gain from this experience?

User: Well, if they support it, I could build stronger relationships and feel more involved. Even if they don’t, I can still learn from the experience and who knows, maybe it'll lead to other opportunities.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the potential for personal growth and connection can truly shift your perspective. It’s about building resilience regardless of the outcome. Let’s summarize what we've explored today. What are the main takeaways for you?

User: I’ve realized that I need to challenge my negative thoughts and embrace the recognition I receive. I also see the value in taking action and connecting with people through volunteering.

Consultant: That’s insightful! Recognizing those patterns is a significant step forward. As we wrap up today’s session, what strategies will you carry with you to maintain this momentum and keep nurturing your connections?

User: I will remind myself of the compliments I receive and the positive moments I experience. I’ll also take that step to propose the outreach program. 

Consultant: That's a great plan, Zhang Wei! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. It's been a pleasure to work with you today. If you ever feel the need for support, feel free to reach out again. You're doing well on this journey!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and the encouragement. I’m looking forward to seeing how things unfold!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again today. I'm looking forward to continuing our conversation. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve actually been feeling a bit better. I met someone during a volunteer activity who shared similar experiences to mine, and we had a nice chat. It made me feel less alone.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Connecting with someone who understands your experiences can be incredibly powerful. What about this interaction made you feel better?

User: I felt a sense of understanding and shared experience with him. It was nice to talk about our struggles without judgment.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful connection. Feeling accepted and understood can help alleviate feelings of loneliness. Have you thought about reaching out to him again or similar friends for support?

User: Yes, I have been considering it. I think I might invite him for coffee or a walk. It feels tempting to build on that connection.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging with supportive people can help strengthen your emotional connections. What do you hope to achieve during this outing?

User: I want to share my feelings more openly and maybe get to know him better. It's just nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: Opening up about your feelings can be a great step in building a connection. How do you imagine he might respond to your sharing?

User: I think he might relate to my experiences and share his too. I hope it fosters a deeper bond, which I think I need right now.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook. Building deeper bonds through sharing personal experiences can lead to stronger friendships. Have you thought about what particular feelings or thoughts you want to express?

User: I’d like to talk about my difficulties and how I’ve been coping. I want him to know my situation, but I don’t want to overwhelm him either.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It might help to start with lighter topics and gradually touch on more personal experiences. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think easing into the conversation is a good approach. It would make me feel less pressured too.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking it slow can help both of you feel comfortable. As you prepare for this meeting, are there any specific concerns or fears you have about it?

User: I guess I'm afraid he might not reciprocate or that I might come off as too needy. It’s hard to share when you think about how someone might react.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. It can be challenging to express our vulnerabilities. What do you think could help you manage these fears as you get ready for the conversation?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it's okay to be open and that he might appreciate my honesty. It wouldn’t be fair to expect him to always reciprocate.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset to adopt. Sometimes, setting realistic expectations about sharing can ease the pressure. How do you plan to remind yourself of this as the meeting approaches?

User: I might write a few notes on what I want to say and include those reminders about being open and accepting whatever response he has.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Writing down your thoughts can provide clarity and confidence. Once you meet and share, how do you hope to feel afterward?

User: I hope I’ll feel relief, like I’ve taken a step forward. Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, I want to feel proud of myself for trying.

Consultant: That's a healthy way to look at it. Taking risks in sharing can often lead to personal growth, no matter the outcome. Reflecting on that will serve you well. What other coping strategies do you have in mind for when things get overwhelming?

User: I think talking with friends more often and keeping up with my volunteer work could help me feel more connected. I want these interactions to become a routine.

Consultant: Establishing regular social interactions can provide stability and support. Are there specific activities or groups you’d like to engage with moving forward?

User: I’d like to join a local group that focuses on volunteering. This way, I can meet new people while doing something I care about.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Engaging in activities that you’re passionate about not only helps expand your social circle but also allows you to connect with like-minded individuals. How do you feel about looking for groups like that?

User: It excites me! I feel encouraged to explore those options and even sign up for something soon.

Consultant: That enthusiasm is wonderful! Exploring new social opportunities can enhance your support network. As we wrap up today, what key insights do you take away from our discussion?

User: I feel more confident about reaching out to others and being open. My fears seem manageable now, and I have a plan in mind.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You've taken important steps towards building meaningful connections. Keep focusing on those strategies, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. How do you want to carry this momentum into the coming week?

User: I plan to reach out to that guy for coffee and look into volunteering opportunities. I feel hopeful about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhang Wei! Continue nurturing that hope, and don’t hesitate to share your experiences next time we meet. I'm proud of the progress you've made. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel ready to take these steps now.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again today. During our previous sessions, we discussed how your outlook on emotions and life situations has improved. How are you feeling now?

User: Hi! I feel much better, actually. I have some hope for the future. My moods are more stable, and I no longer have those suicidal thoughts.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. Can you share what strategies you've found most helpful in achieving this stability?

User: I think talking to my supporters really helped. Just having someone to listen made a big difference. Also, I’ve been trying to focus on the little things that bring me joy.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies. It’s great that you’re building connections and finding joy in small things. As we talk today, let’s reflect on your journey and think about your goals moving forward. What would you like to achieve in our time together? 

User: I’d like to set some realistic goals for my future. I want to keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: Setting realistic goals is a wonderful idea. What specific areas do you want to focus on for these goals? 

User: I want to look for stable housing and maybe even find a job. I feel like having a routine would help me maintain my progress.

Consultant: That sounds very practical. Finding stable housing and employment can definitely contribute to your sense of routine and stability. What steps do you think you could take towards those goals?

User: I guess I could start by reaching out to the resources I know about for housing. I’ve also thought about updating my resume for job opportunities.

Consultant: Those are excellent first steps! It’s proactive of you to consider reaching out for resources. How confident do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel somewhat confident, but I sometimes worry about rejection or not being good enough.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports these feelings of inadequacy?

User: I suppose I’ve faced a lot of rejection in the past, which makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: That makes sense. Past experiences can shape our current feelings. However, let’s also consider the progress you've made so far. How can we reframe the narrative around those past rejections?

User: Maybe I can see them as learning experiences instead of failures. Each rejection taught me something.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Shifting that perspective can help you feel more resilient. As you prepare to seek housing and jobs, what affirmations or positive statements could support you through that process?

User: I could tell myself that I'm deserving of a stable life and capable of finding a job.

Consultant: Those affirmations are powerful! Repeating them can help ground you in your journey ahead. As we look to conclude our session, let’s summarize your progress and plans. What do you consider your key achievements from our sessions?

User: I’ve gained a better perspective on my situation and learned to connect with others. It feels good to know I'm not alone.

Consultant: Absolutely! That connection and changed perspective are vital achievements. How might you maintain those connections and this mindset as you move forward?

User: I think I’ll keep communicating with my supporters and practicing my positive affirmations daily.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Before we finish today’s session, is there anything in particular you want to remember or focus on as you continue your journey?

User: I want to keep reminding myself to take things one step at a time. I don’t have to rush my progress.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach, Zhang Wei. Taking it one step at a time allows you to build confidence along the way. Lastly, you’ve developed many skills and insights during our time together. Remember, if you ever need to reconnect or seek support again, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all the help you've given me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I wish you the best in your journey ahead. Take care and keep in touch!

User: I will. Thanks again!
