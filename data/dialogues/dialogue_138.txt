Consultant: Hello, 小音! I'm really glad you're here today. I know you've recently faced some changes, and I'm here to help. Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I feel really lonely at school. Since I just moved here, I don't have any friends, and my mom is always busy with my little brother. I feel like she doesn't care about me anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite isolated and overlooked, especially with your mom focusing on your brother. Let's talk more about your feelings. When you think about feeling ignored, what does that make you feel inside?

User: I feel sad and even a bit angry. I want my mom to notice me, but it seems like she only cares about my brother.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, 小音. You miss your mom's attention and support, and it can be tough for anyone to feel neglected. Have there been any times you managed to talk to her about how you feel?

User: Not really. I don’t want to make her upset or make her think I’m jealous. I just keep it to myself.

Consultant: That’s really brave of you to hold those feelings inside, but it’s also important to share them. Sometimes, talking can help lighten the load we carry. If you were to describe your feelings to your mom, what do you think you would want to say?

User: I guess I would tell her that I feel left out and that I miss spending time with her. But I’m not sure how to say it without hurting her feelings.

Consultant: It's great that you’re thinking about both your feelings and your mom's. Perhaps we can figure out a way for you to express your feelings gently. What if we practiced how you might bring it up with her? 

User: That sounds like it could help! I’d like to know what to say.

Consultant: Awesome! We can start by framing it positively. You might say something like, "Mom, I really appreciate everything you do for me and my brother, but I feel a bit lonely sometimes. I miss spending time with you." How does that sound?

User: I think that sounds okay. It feels good to say "I appreciate" instead of just saying I’m sad.

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging the good things can make your message softer and more likely to be heard. How do you feel about trying this approach with her sometime?

User: I feel a little nervous, but I think I could do it. What if she doesn’t understand?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but you can express your feelings clearly, and it might help her understand your perspective. Sometimes, people have no idea how someone else feels until it’s shared. Would keeping a journal of your feelings help you track how you feel and prepare for that talk?

User: A journal? Like writing down my feelings every day?

Consultant: Yes! Writing can be a powerful way to understand your emotions better. You can jot down your thoughts about your day, how interactions make you feel, or anything else that comes to mind. It can also help you see patterns in your emotions.

User: I might give that a try! It could help me figure things out.

Consultant: That's a wonderful step! As you start writing, it could also allow you to reflect, making it easier to share your feelings with your mom. Let’s also think about your experience at school. How has it been making new friends there?

User: It's really hard! Everyone already knows each other, and I don't know how to start talking to them. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Making new friends can be challenging. What if we brainstorm some ways to start conversations? 

User: Um, maybe I could try to compliment someone or ask about their favorite games?

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Compliments can be a great icebreaker, and asking about shared interests is a wonderful way to connect. Have you noticed anyone in particular that might be a good person to approach?

User: There’s a girl in my class who seems nice. She has a cute backpack, and I could probably ask her where she got it.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Complimenting something visible like her backpack can serve as a great starter. If you feel nervous, you might practice what to say in front of a mirror or with someone you trust. 

User: I think I could do that! 

Consultant: I'm so proud of you for considering these steps, 小音. It's a journey, and every little effort counts. As we come to an end today, what are some takeaways that you feel will help you?

User: I can write in a journal about my feelings and try to talk to my mom, and maybe I can compliment the girl in class about her backpack.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You’re building a plan that can help ease the loneliness and strengthen your connection with your mom and peers. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous, and taking small steps can lead to big changes.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better thinking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, 小音! You've made some great progress today. I'm here for you whenever you need to talk. Don’t hesitate to come back, and good luck with your plans!

User: Thanks! I will!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyin! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, but I still feel a bit lonely in my new school. I really want to make friends but don’t know how.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress in feeling better, but the loneliness is still challenging. Can you share more about how your days are at school? Are there moments when you feel more connected?

User: Sometimes I have fun during recess because we play games, but often I just stand aside since I don't know how to join in. I wish I could be more confident like the other kids.

Consultant: I understand that joining in can feel intimidating. It's great that you're playing games during recess, though! What kinds of games do you enjoy? Maybe we can think about how to get involved more in those activities.

User: I like playing tag, but I’m always worried I might mess up or no one will want to play with me.

Consultant: That's a normal concern, Xiaoyin. Let's think about it this way: what evidence do you have that people wouldn't want to play with you? Can you think of a time when someone included you?

User: Well, there was this one time when I joined a group playing tag, and they let me play. I had fun then.

Consultant: That's a great example! It shows that when you take the step to join, it can lead to enjoyable experiences. How about we brainstorm some small ways you could start joining these games more often?

User: I could maybe try asking someone if I can join next time. That seems doable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking to join can be a powerful step. It might feel a bit scary, but remember that many kids would likely be happy to include you. What do you think you might say to them?

User: I could say, “Can I play with you?” That sounds simple.

Consultant: Yes, that's perfect! It’s friendly and straightforward. Let’s talk about how you can practice this. Maybe you could even do a small role-play here. How do you feel about that?

User: I think that could help! I want to get good at this.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say we’re in the playground, and you see some kids playing tag. You could approach them. What would you say?

User: I’d walk up, smile, and say, “Hi, can I play tag with you?”

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Smiling makes you more approachable. How do you think the kids might respond to you?

User: I hope they say yes! I really want them to.

Consultant: It's natural to hope for a positive response. Even if they don’t, it doesn’t reflect your worth or abilities. What’s important is that you took that brave step. How would you feel if they did say yes?

User: I’d feel really happy and proud of myself!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling happy and proud is such an encouraging response. Let's think also about your relationship with your mom. How do you feel about your conversations with her now?

User: I think we’re getting better at talking. I told her I wanted to feel more included, and she listened.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! How does having her support make you feel about your experiences at school?

User: It makes me feel like I have someone in my corner. I feel less alone knowing she cares.

Consultant: That’s invaluable. Knowing you have her support can really boost your confidence. As we work together, how can we involve her more in your efforts to adapt socially?

User: Maybe she can help me come up with things to say or do to make friends. 

Consultant: Definitely! Collaborating with her on strategies can empower you both. How about you share with her some of what we discussed today, especially your bravery in asking to join games?

User: I can do that! I think she’d be proud of me.

Consultant: She likely will be! It’s great to see you taking these steps. Are there any other concerns on your mind today about school or making friends?

User: I sometimes worry about feeling lonely even if I make a few friends. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Making friends is a process, and it's common to feel some loneliness along the way. How might we address those feelings when they come up?

User: I could try talking to my mom or even my teacher if I feel really alone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing how you feel with someone you trust can lighten that burden. It’s okay to reach out when you're feeling alone. You’re not alone in these feelings. 

User: I think I can work on speaking up about how I feel more.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiaoyin! As you learn to express your feelings, it will help you feel more connected and supported. Learning to communicate your emotions is a vital skill in building and maintaining friendships.

User: I’m excited to try these things. I feel like I can do it!

Consultant: I'm proud to hear that! You’ve made great strides, and it’s all about taking those small steps. Over time, these little actions can lead to big changes. 

User: Thanks for believing in me. I needed this encouragement!

Consultant: I’m always here to support you, Xiaoyin. Before our session ends today, let’s recap what you plan to work on until we meet again. 

User: I’ll practice saying, “Can I play with you?” and talk to my mom about how to manage loneliness if it comes up.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m excited for you to put this into action. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when you need support. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyin! You’re doing a wonderful job, and I believe in your ability to adapt. Take care until we chat again!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yin! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, I guess. I joined a few group activities in class and made some new friends, but sometimes I still feel lonely, especially when they hang out without me.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been joining group activities and making new friends! Feeling lonely at times is quite normal, especially in new social circles. Can you tell me more about those feelings of loneliness?

User: Well, sometimes during lunch or break, I see them laughing together, and I wish I could be part of that, but then I just feel left out.

Consultant: I understand that can be really tough, watching others laugh and feeling a sense of exclusion. It sounds like you desire to be included more often. Have you thought about any strategies to feel more connected with them during those times?

User: I try to join them when I can, but I feel nervous talking to them. I want to feel more confident.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous when attempting to connect with new friends. Let's explore those situations together. What thoughts go through your mind just before you approach them?

User: I worry that they might not want to talk to me or that I’ll say something silly.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. It seems you're concerned about how they might perceive you. Can we try to challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that they wouldn't want to talk to you?

User: I guess I don't really have any evidence. They did invite me to join them once, but I was too shy to go.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiao Yin. It sounds like they see value in having you around since they invited you. How do you think you could remind yourself of that invitation in the future when feeling unsure?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that they liked having me with them and that it’s okay to feel shy.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising approach! By reminding yourself of the positive interactions you've had, it might help to ease your nerves. If you feel up to it, what’s one small action you could take next time to engage with them?

User: Maybe I can ask them what they are laughing about before they leave for lunch? It might be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Asking about their laughter could be a great icebreaker. How do you feel thinking about taking that step?

User: It feels a bit scary, but also exciting! I want to try.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel both excited and scared. Those feelings show that you care about the outcome. What do you think you could do to manage the fear when you approach them?

User: I could take a few deep breaths before I go over to them. That might help calm me down.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful technique to help manage anxiety. Let’s practice how you could do that before approaching them. Do you feel ready to give this a try at your next opportunity?

User: Yes, I think I can do that!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As you prepare for this, remember that building connections takes time and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Besides working on connecting with your classmates, are there any activities or interests you’d like to explore that could help expand your social circle?

User: I really enjoy drawing, and I think there might be an art club. Joining could be fun.

Consultant: Joining an art club sounds like a great idea! It provides a chance to meet others who share a similar interest, which can make it easier to connect. Would you feel comfortable checking out that club?

User: Yes! I think that could be really fun and help me meet more people.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! Engaging in activities you love can not only help you connect with others but also boost your overall mood. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today related to your social experiences?

User: I guess I just worry a lot about fitting in. I hope I can be more outgoing.

Consultant: It's okay to have those worries; many people do. What can you do to remind yourself that you are already doing well by taking steps to fit in, like joining groups and expressing your feelings?

User: I can tell myself that trying is what matters, and that it's okay not to be perfect right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! Every step you take is valuable. Celebrating your efforts, no matter how small, will help reinforce your growth. As we wrap up today, think about how these strategies might help you in the upcoming days. 

User: I will! I feel more hopeful about it. Thank you for all the advice!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Yin! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember, building friendships is a journey, and you're not alone on this path. If you need any support, I'm here for you. Looking forward to seeing you next time!

User: Thank you! I can't wait to share how it goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yin! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good. I’ve made some new friends at school, and we’ve been playing together after class. It makes me happy, but sometimes I worry about whether they really like me.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear you’re making friends and enjoying time with them. You mentioned worrying about whether they really like you. Can you tell me more about those feelings?

User: Well, I guess I sometimes feel like I’m not interesting enough. What if they don’t want to play with me anymore or think I'm annoying?

Consultant: It’s natural to have those thoughts, especially when building new friendships. It sounds like you might be worried about being accepted. What evidence do you have that they might not want to play with you anymore?

User: I don’t really have any proof. It’s just a feeling I get sometimes, especially when they laugh at something I say or do. I wonder if they’re laughing at me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s easy to assume the worst in those moments. Have there been times when they laughed and it was something positive rather than about you?

User: Yes, actually! One time, we were playing a game, and I made a silly joke, and they laughed, but it felt like they were having fun... not laughing at me.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It sounds like they enjoy your company and the joy you're bringing into the group. How does this realization make you feel about your friendships?

User: It makes me feel a bit better. I guess I can focus on the fun we have rather than worrying too much.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the enjoyable moments is really important. Let’s explore how you can build on these positive feelings. What are some activities you enjoy doing with your friends?

User: We like playing tag and drawing together. Sometimes we share lunch, too. It’s fun!

Consultant: Those sound like great activities! Sharing meals can really enhance connections, too. Have you thought about suggesting any new games or activities to your friends?

User: I haven’t, but that could be fun! I could ask them to help me draw a big poster together or something.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Collaborating on something creative can really strengthen your bond. How do you think your friends would react if you suggested it?

User: I think they would probably like it. They’re always excited when we do activities together.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Yin! Now, let’s talk about trust and communication. What do you think is important for you to feel trusted by your friends?

User: I think being honest and keeping their secrets is important. Like, if they tell me something personal, I need to make sure I don’t share it with others.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a key part of building trust in friendships! How about communication? What helps you feel comfortable talking to your friends?

User: I think when we laugh together, it makes me feel more comfortable. And when we listen to each other!

Consultant: Absolutely! Laughter and good listening are excellent ways to foster communication. How has your relationship with your family been lately?

User: It’s been good. My mom, brother, and I have been spending more time together. We even had a picnic last weekend!

Consultant: That sounds delightful! Spending quality time with family helps reinforce those connections. How did you feel during the picnic?

User: I felt really happy, especially when we played games and helped each other. It was nice to be together.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Sharing activities can deepen family bonds. Now, what are some future family activities you might like to plan together?

User: Maybe we can go hiking or have another picnic. I could even invite my friends next time!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Inviting your friends could blend both your family and social circles. What steps do you think you could take to organize this?

User: I can talk to my mom about it and see when everyone is free. I can also ask my friends if they would like to join!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect approach, Xiao Yin! It shows initiative and helps strengthen your connections both with your family and your friends. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our session?

User: I feel more confident about my friendships and how to communicate better. I also have some fun ideas for family activities!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’ve made great progress today. Remember, focusing on trust and positive interactions will enrich your relationships. I’m here to support you, so feel free to return anytime you need assistance. How do you feel moving forward?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to try out my new ideas and see how my friendships and family time grow.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! I’m confident you’ll do wonderfully. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

User: I want to join the school’s art club. I love drawing, and it would be fun to meet new friends who enjoy art too.

Consultant: Joining the art club sounds like a wonderful idea! It aligns perfectly with your interests and offers a chance to connect with others. What steps do you think you can take to make this goal a reality?

User: I could ask my teacher for more information about the club and maybe go to a meeting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Taking that initiative to ask your teacher is a brave step. How do you feel about pursuing this goal?

User: I feel excited but a little nervous since I haven’t been to a club meeting before.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous when trying something new. Remember, it’s a chance for growth and fun! Let’s think of some ways to ease your nerves before the meeting. What could help you feel more comfortable?

User: Maybe I could talk to a friend about going with me. It might help to have someone familiar there.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a friend by your side can provide support and make the experience less intimidating. What’s a specific time frame you’d like to aim for to attend the meeting?

User: I would like to meet with my teacher before the end of this week, then maybe attend the meeting next week.

Consultant: That’s a very realistic timeline! It gives you enough time to gather information and prepare yourself mentally. As you work towards this, let’s also think about how to maintain the confidence you’ve built up. What strategies have helped you feel more confident lately?

User: I think reminding myself of the things I’ve accomplished helps. And whenever I feel doubt, I try to tell myself I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a powerful self-affirmation! Recognizing your achievements is key in reinforcing your self-belief. How will you continue to remind yourself of your accomplishments as you work toward joining the art club?

User: I could keep a journal where I write down my achievements and how I felt about them.

Consultant: A journaling practice is a fantastic idea! It will not only help you track your progress but also serve as a source of encouragement when you review it. What do you think will be the most valuable aspect of this journal for you?

User: I think reading about my successes will remind me that I can do things, even when I’m nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can serve as a great reminder of your resilience and capabilities. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you’re taking away from today’s session. What stands out to you as your main takeaway?

User: I feel more motivated to pursue my goals, and I have a plan to join the art club. I also learned that reminding myself of my achievements helps.

Consultant: That’s a strong takeaway! You’ve made great progress, and I believe you have the strength to achieve your new goals. Remember, you can always return to these strategies and the positive affirmations you’ve developed if you face challenges. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel really positive! I can't wait to start working on my goals.
