Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hao! I'm glad you're here today. I’d like to start by hearing about what’s been on your mind lately. How are you feeling?

User: Hi. I've really been missing my mom a lot, especially since I’ve been at boarding school. I keep calling her and it makes it hard for me to concentrate on my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite a bit of longing for your mom, which is affecting your focus on schoolwork. Can you share a little more about what occurs when you try to study? 

User: When I sit down to do my homework, I just think about calling her. And if I don't get to talk to her, I feel really sad and distracted.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It seems like your desire to connect with your mom is really strong and it's pulling your attention away from your studies. What do you think you’re hoping to get from those calls? 

User: I just want to feel close to her. Sometimes I feel really lonely here and I just miss her a lot.

Consultant: Loneliness can be really tough, especially when you’re away from home. And it sounds like calling her helps you feel more connected. Have you thought about other ways to cope with your feelings of loneliness? 

User: Not really... I just keep thinking about her. I don’t know what else to do.

Consultant: That's understandable, Xiao Hao. It's perfectly normal to miss your mom, especially since you’re still adjusting to being in boarding school. What activities or interactions do you enjoy that might help you feel less lonely?

User: I like playing soccer at school, but sometimes I feel too shy to join in with the other kids.

Consultant: Playing soccer sounds like a great way to make friends and have some fun. It’s okay to feel a bit shy. What if we think about ways you could approach your classmates? 

User: I guess I could just ask them if I can join in next time they play. But what if they say no?

Consultant: It's totally normal to worry about that. But sometimes, our fears of rejection are stronger than reality. What evidence do you have that they would say no? 

User: Well, I don’t really know them well, so I just assume they won’t want me there.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but perhaps they might be more welcoming than you think. If a friend asked you to join, how would you respond? 

User: I would probably say yes because it's nice to have more people to play with.

Consultant: Exactly! So, if you can think of it that way, there’s a chance they might feel the same way towards you. What do you think about giving it a try?

User: I guess it could be worth a shot. I just feel nervous about it.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It might help to start with a small step, like just introducing yourself before asking to join. Would you feel comfortable trying that next time?

User: Maybe... I’ll think about it. But I really do miss my mom, and it still makes it hard to concentrate.

Consultant: It’s okay to miss her, and part of dealing with that can be about finding other sources of support. How about we brainstorm some comforting things or activities you can do when you miss her?

User: I like drawing. Maybe I could draw pictures of us together.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Drawing can be a great way to express your feelings and keep your mom close in spirit. You could even share those drawings with her later.

User: That would be nice. I think she’d like that. 

Consultant: I’m sure she would! It could serve as both a way to connect with her and to channel your feelings into something creative. When you feel the urge to call her, perhaps you can also take some time to draw or doodle instead.

User: That might help. I’ll try.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’re already taking steps towards building some independence. Remember, it’s okay to miss her, but finding ways to cope can help you feel better overall. 

User: Yeah, I suppose I don't have to feel sad all the time.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re learning to create a balance between missing your mom and building your own connections here. How do you feel about moving forward with the ideas we discussed today?

User: It seems okay. I think I can try some of them. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude, Xiao Hao! As we've talked about ways to cope, you've already shown strength and resilience. Let’s keep exploring these strategies together in our next session.

User: Okay, I’ll be ready to share how it goes! 

Consultant: Great! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re not alone. I’m here to support you. Take care until we meet again! 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better already.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad you're here today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately. It seems you've been reflecting on your feelings towards your mother and your surroundings.

User: Hi. Yes, I've been thinking a lot about my mother recently. I keep wanting to call her, but I’m trying to limit how often I do it. I feel lonely sometimes, especially at school.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of longing for your mother and the challenges of adjusting to your current environment. Can you tell me more about your feelings of loneliness at school? What triggers that feeling for you?

User: I miss my mother's presence a lot. At school, I see other kids with their parents or siblings, and I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to when I need someone. It makes me sad.

Consultant: I can understand why that would be difficult for you. Missing your mother and feeling alone can be really tough. Have you thought about other ways to express your feelings or connect with others while you're at school?

User: I've started writing a diary to express what I feel, which helps a bit. But I still feel like I need more support, like being able to talk to someone. 

Consultant: Writing in a diary is a wonderful way to express your feelings, Xiaohao. It seems like you’re looking for different ways to find support. What kind of activities or connections do you think might help you feel less lonely at school?

User: I don't really know. Maybe making friends would help? But I find it hard to talk to others and build connections.

Consultant: Making friends can be challenging, especially when you're feeling lonely. How about we explore some small steps you could take to start connecting with classmates? Perhaps sharing your interests could be a good way to break the ice?

User: That sounds good, but what if they don’t want to be friends? I’m scared of being rejected.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have that fear of rejection. Many people feel that way when trying to make new friends. What if we flipped this around a bit? Could you think of how you would feel if someone approached you to be friends?

User: I guess I would be happy if they wanted to be friends. But I still worry.

Consultant: It’s good to recognize that positive possibility! Maybe we can work on some ways for you to approach others that might feel less intimidating. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I’d like that. It would be nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to ask a classmate about something you have in common, like a subject you both like or a sport. You might be surprised by how receptive they can be. What do you think you could start with?

User: Maybe I could ask about a game we both like or something we did in class. That seems easier.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Engaging in shared interests can really help build a connection. Remember, taking small steps is key. How do you feel about trying this next week?

User: I think I can try that. I'm a little nervous, but it feels doable.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel it’s doable! Nerves are completely normal. What's important is that you're willing to take that step. Do you think writing about how it goes in your diary could help you process your experiences afterwards?

User: Yes, I think I’ll do that. Writing helps me understand my feelings better.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Reflecting on your experiences can help you grow more comfortable with these interactions. As we explore these feelings, how have you noticed your thoughts changing about your relationship with your mother?

User: I’ve realized I depend a lot on her for support. I want to learn how to feel okay even when I miss her.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiaohao. It shows that you're ready to explore other sources of support. Besides your diary, are there any activities you enjoy that could also help you feel connected to yourself when you miss her?

User: I like drawing and sometimes I draw her. It makes me feel better.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a beautiful way to express your feelings. It can also serve as a way to connect with your emotions and memories. Perhaps you could draw when you’re missing her as a way to channel those feelings into something creative?

User: That makes sense. I might try to make some drawings for her, too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Creating something for her could also strengthen your bond, even from a distance. What will you draw for her?

User: Maybe a picture of us together at the park. That’s a happy memory.

Consultant: That sounds lovely and very meaningful. Creating art based on happy memories can also help brighten your mood! As we wrap up today, what are some ways you feel you might adapt to your feelings when they come up over the next week?

User: I can try talking to classmates, writing in my diary, and drawing. I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiaohao! You’re taking meaningful steps to connect with others and express yourself. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and be gentle with yourself as you adjust. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been wonderful to see your progress today. Taking these steps shows your strength. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember you can revisit these strategies. I look forward to talking again soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus more in class and participate in activities, but sometimes I still feel a bit lost and nervous. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to focus in class and get involved! Feeling lost can be completely normal when adapting to new environments. Can you share what activities you’ve tried participating in?

User: I joined the art club last week. It was fun, but I felt nervous meeting new people. 

Consultant: Joining the art club is a wonderful step! It’s understandable to feel nervous around new people. Do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when you felt nervous during your first meeting?

User: I kept thinking they might not like me or that I wouldn't fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to handle. It sounds like you were worried about how others would perceive you. Can we explore how those thoughts made you feel at that moment?

User: I felt really anxious and wanted to leave the room.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s tough when anxiety makes you want to escape the situation. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts; what evidence do you have that supports the idea that they wouldn’t like you?

User: I guess I don't really know them yet, so I just assumed. 

Consultant: That’s a good insight! It’s often easy to jump to conclusions without enough evidence. If you were to consider a more encouraging thought, what could that be instead?

User: Maybe they just want to get to know me too? 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a much kinder perspective. How could focusing on that thought change your feelings when you attend the next meeting?

User: I might feel less anxious and try to talk to them instead of just sitting quietly.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Xiaohao! Each time you go, you could remind yourself that they are interested in getting to know you. Would you like to set a small goal for the next club meeting?

User: I could try to say “hi” to at least one person!

Consultant: That’s a perfect goal! Saying “hi” can be a simple yet effective way to start a conversation. How do you think accomplishing this will make you feel?

User: I would feel proud of myself if I did it!

Consultant: Feeling proud is such a valuable emotion! It sounds like a great motivator for you. Let's think ahead: if you do say “hi” and it goes well, what do you think that will mean for you?

User: Maybe it would make me feel more confident about joining in more.

Consultant: Exactly! Building confidence often comes from taking small steps. This time, what might be a supportive thought you could use if things don’t go as planned?

User: I could remind myself it’s okay; I can try again next time.

Consultant: That's a wonderful self-compassionate thought. Remember, every experience is a chance to learn. Is there anything else you’d like to share about your feelings before we move on to discuss other social activities?

User: I’m a little worried about group projects in class because I don’t want to let my teammates down. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it sounds like teamwork can feel a bit daunting. Can you think of what you believe would be helpful for you during these group projects?

User: I think I need to remind myself that everyone has strengths and I can contribute too.

Consultant: That’s a solid perspective! Recognizing that everyone has something to contribute can ease some pressure. What strengths do you think you bring to group work?

User: I’m good at helping organize ideas and making them look nice.

Consultant: Those are great strengths to have! Being organized can really benefit your team. How can you express this to your classmates so they can understand your value in a group?

User: I could let them know at the start of the project what I can do to help. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting clear expectations can boost your confidence and show your classmates that you’re eager to contribute. How do you feel about applying this in your next group project?

User: I feel more confident now. It seems manageable!

Consultant: That's wonderful! Remember, each small step you take builds your confidence. How do you want to remind yourself of these insights when you're in these interactions?

User: I’ll write down my goals and supportive thoughts so I can look at them before class!

Consultant: Writing them down is a fantastic idea! It will keep your goals and supportive thoughts fresh in your mind. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the progress we’ve made?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try these new ideas!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’ve made great strides, and I’m proud of you. In our next meeting, we can talk about how the next meetings and projects went. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take your time.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to sharing my experiences.

Consultant: I can’t wait to hear all about them, Xiaohao! Take care and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaohao! It's great to see you today. I remember last time we talked about your experiences in the interest group at school and how you've been feeling about social interactions recently. How have things been for you since then?

User: Hi. It's been interesting! I've met some new friends and started talking to them a bit more, but I still feel a little nervous sometimes when I interact with them.

Consultant: That's really promising, Xiaohao! It's great that you're starting to engage with new friends. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel nervous during these interactions?

User: Well, sometimes I worry about what they'll think of me or if they will want to talk to me. I don't want to say something silly and make them laugh at me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those thoughts. It sounds like you're concerned about being judged by others. Let's explore this together—when you have those worries, what specific thoughts come to your mind at that moment?

User: I often think that if I say the wrong thing, they will think I'm not cool or that they would rather not talk to me anymore.

Consultant: That's an understandable fear, but it sounds quite extreme. Can we look at that thought a little more closely? What evidence do you have that saying something wrong will lead to them not wanting to be your friend?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. I mean, they still talk to me! 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Xiaohao! It seems like your friends are still interested in you, even when you worry about saying the wrong thing. How do you think it would feel to challenge that anxious thought next time you talk to them?

User: It might feel freeing, like I don’t have to be perfect all the time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Being free from the pressure of being perfect can help you enjoy those interactions more. What's one small step you could take to challenge that thought next time you’re with your friends? 

User: Maybe I could just try to focus on having fun and not worry so much about talking perfectly. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Shifting your focus to enjoying the moment can really help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about giving that a try in your next social situation?

User: I feel a bit excited but also still nervous. What if I mess up?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that mix of excitement and nervousness. How about we come up with a few simple phrases or questions you could use to keep the conversation going, just in case you feel unsure?

User: Sure! I could ask them about their favorite games or what they did over the weekend. 

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! They show interest in your friends and encourage them to share. How do you feel about practicing responding to them, just in case you're nervous?

User: That sounds okay! I think I can manage that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it's all about building those connections step by step. What do you think is one of your strengths in social situations?

User: I guess I’m a good listener. I enjoy hearing what others have to say. 

Consultant: That's a great strength! Being a good listener can make people feel valued. Next time you talk to your friends, you can use that strength to connect with them even more. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more confident, like I have something to offer.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Building on your strengths can help enhance your social confidence. As we continue, let’s think about how we can embrace mistakes as learning opportunities. How do you feel about that perspective?

User: I think that makes sense. Mistakes happen, and it's good to learn from them instead of worrying too much. 

Consultant: Exactly, and that kind of thinking can really free you up to be yourself in social situations. Can we set a goal for your next interaction with your friends based on what we've discussed today?

User: I think I could aim to start a conversation and focus on listening rather than worrying so much.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Xiaohao! By focusing on listening, you can enjoy the interaction more. Before we wrap up, can you share how you plan to remind yourself of this during your next conversation?

User: I could keep telling myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I’m good at listening. 

Consultant: Perfect! Those reminders can serve you well. As we conclude our session today, how satisfied do you feel with your progress in building confidence for social interactions?

User: I feel pretty good! I’m looking forward to trying this out.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made significant progress today. Remember to celebrate your small successes, and I'm confident you'll continue building on your strengths. If you ever need further support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaohao! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Hao! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I’ve actually started to enjoy being the team leader for our class activity. But sometimes I still worry that I won't be able to do well.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re enjoying your role! It sounds like you’re becoming more confident. Let's dig a little deeper—what specific worries do you have about not being able to perform well?

User: I think I might forget something important or not manage my group well. I worry that my classmates won’t take me seriously or that I’ll let them down.

Consultant: Those are understandable concerns, especially when you have the responsibility of leading a group. Can you share what you think might happen if those worries came true? 

User: I guess if I forgot something, they might think I'm not a good leader. I don’t want to disappoint them.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s normal to fear letting people down, especially when you care about your classmates' opinions. Have you thought about moments when you felt prepared or confident in prior group activities?

User: Yes, in the past, I felt good when I helped organize our school’s sports day. Everyone seemed happy with how things went.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful experience to draw from! It shows you have succeeded before. How might you remind yourself of that success when doubts or worries start creeping in?

User: Maybe I can think back to how well I organized the sports day and tell myself that I can do it again.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your past successes can be a powerful tool. Also, what strategies could you use in the moment when you're feeling anxious about your leadership?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing. Maybe that could help calm me down before meetings or when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique to reduce anxiety. Let’s practice a quick deep breathing exercise together. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold it for four… and then slowly breathe out through your mouth for a count of six. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice! I think that could help. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, using deep breathing before or during stressful moments can really ground you. Is there anything else that might help you feel more confident when leading?

User: Maybe if I keep a checklist for our meetings, I won’t forget anything important.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Having a checklist can help you feel more organized and prepared. What would you include on that checklist?

User: I’d write down topics we need to discuss and tasks that need to be completed. 

Consultant: That sounds very practical. As you prepare each checklist, how might you feel knowing you have a plan in place?

User: I think it would make me feel more in control and less worried.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset. Establishing a plan can significantly ease anxiety. As we continue, I want you to really look at how your feelings improve with these strategies. How do you think your feelings about your role might change as you employ these techniques?

User: I think I’d become less worried and start feeling more capable. 

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! As you apply these tools, it’ll be important to celebrate your efforts, too. What are some ways you can acknowledge your progress?

User: I could keep a journal or share my successes with my mom. 

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a fantastic way to track your achievements and growth. What might you write in your journal after a successful meeting?

User: I could write about what went well, how I felt, and anything I learned.

Consultant: I like that! Documenting your experiences will help reinforce your successes and build your confidence. As we move forward, how do you feel about the changes you’re making in managing pressure and embracing your responsibilities?

User: I feel optimistic! It seems like these strategies could really help me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Hao! Remember, you’re capable of more than you think, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. Can you think of how these changes will impact your overall feelings towards school and your classmates?

User: I think I’ll feel more excited about participating and contributing to our group, instead of feeling stressed.

Consultant: Exactly! That shift in perspective can lead to a much more enjoyable experience. As we wrap things up today, let’s reflect on your journey. What are you most proud of since we began working together?

User: I’m proud of stepping up as a leader and starting to feel more confident in myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Your progress is commendable. As you face future challenges, what strategies will you remind yourself to use?

User: I’ll use deep breathing, my checklist, and reflect on my past successes.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to maintain. As we conclude today, I want you to remember that you've made significant strides forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, know that you already have the tools to cope. You're doing remarkably well, and I believe you can manage your feelings effectively moving forward. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help and feel more ready to tackle my responsibilities now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xiao Hao. Don’t hesitate to come back if you need support in the future. Goodbye for now, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohao! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I feel a lot better. I've been able to talk more openly with my family, and our relationship has improved. It's nice to feel more connected with them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your communication with your family has really strengthened. How does that make you feel inside when you connect with them like this?

User: It feels really good. I used to be shy and kept everything to myself, but now I can share my feelings. It’s like a weight has been lifted.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you’re feeling lighter and more open to expressing your feelings. Let’s explore these positive changes a bit more. What specific moments stand out to you when you felt this connection with your family?

User: I remember the other day, we all sat together for dinner, and I told them about my day at school. They listened and asked questions, which made me feel appreciated.

Consultant: That sounds like a very special moment. Feeling appreciated can have such a positive impact. Would you say that this kind of engagement has affected how you view your family dynamics now?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel like they care more about me now. Before, I didn’t think they really noticed how I was feeling.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. It’s essential to feel that your feelings are recognized. How do you think you can maintain this positive dynamic with your family moving forward?

User: I think I need to keep talking to them. Maybe I can try sharing more about my schoolwork or my interests.

Consultant: Sharing your interests and experiences is a great way to keep the communication flow. Have you thought about setting any specific goals for these conversations?

User: I’d like to start sharing a little bit more every week. Maybe on Sundays when we have dinner together.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular check-ins can help sustain your connections. Beyond family, have you noticed any changes in how you interact with classmates or friends at school?

User: I’ve also started talking more in class. I feel less anxious about speaking up and answering questions. 

Consultant: That’s amazing progress! Feeling less anxious in class shows your confidence is growing. What do you believe helps you feel more comfortable when speaking up?

User: I think it helps that I've been practicing what I want to say ahead of time. I feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing is an excellent strategy! It shows you’re actively working on your communication skills. How do you feel when you prepare in this way?

User: I feel more confident. Knowing I have something to say makes it easier to raise my hand.

Consultant: Confidence is key! As you continue to practice, let’s think about how you can build on this success. Are there specific situations you want to prepare for next?

User: I have a presentation coming up. I want to practice so I don’t feel scared while speaking in front of everyone.

Consultant: Preparing for a presentation is a great opportunity to further develop your skills. How do you plan to approach your preparation for this presentation?

User: I think I’ll write out what I want to say and practice in front of a mirror or maybe even with my family for feedback.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Practicing in front of others can make a big difference. If you feel comfortable, how would you handle any nerves that might come up during the actual presentation?

User: I guess I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a powerful tool for calming nerves! And remember, everyone makes mistakes. A positive mindset can really make a difference. As we wrap up today's session, what are your key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I learned that talking to my family can make me feel more connected, and practicing helps me feel confident. I’ll also keep working on my communication in school.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights! It sounds like you have a strong foundation to build upon. As you move forward, what actions will you take to maintain this positive direction?

User: I will keep talking to my family regularly, practice for my presentation, and continue being involved in class discussions.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiaohao! Remember, it’s important to reflect on your progress and celebrate your successes along the way. I’m really proud of you for everything you’ve achieved. If you need to revisit any challenges in the future, I’m here to help you.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared for what’s coming next.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Let's keep up this momentum! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
