Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. Before we dive in, I’d like to understand how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and self-doubting about graduating and finding a job. I can’t help but think everyone dislikes me. It’s been hard for me to even work on my resume, and I struggle with talking to potential employers.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of pressure and self-doubt as graduation approaches. Let’s explore those feelings together. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like everyone dislikes you?

User: I guess it stems from my childhood. My parents divorced when I was young and I was raised by my grandmother. I’ve always felt like I didn’t fit in or that I was a burden to others. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and I can see how those early experiences could influence your feelings today. It’s completely understandable to feel insecure after such events. It’s important to recognize how those feelings manifest in your current situation. How do you think these past experiences affect your ability to apply for jobs now?

User: I just feel so unworthy. Like no one would want to hire someone like me. And the idea of talking to employers terrifies me. I can't even focus enough to get through my job applications.

Consultant: That feeling of unworthiness can be really heavy. I’m here to support you with that. Can we start by identifying some of the thoughts that run through your mind when you think about applying for jobs? What goes through your head?

User: I often think about how I’d probably screw up in an interview or that my resume isn't good enough. I just assume people would see me as a failure.

Consultant: It’s clear that you’re experiencing a lot of negative thoughts. Let’s take a moment to examine those thoughts more closely. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you would screw up in an interview?

User: I don’t really know. I just assume I won’t make a good impression.

Consultant: I understand that it feels very real to you. But it may help to ask, if a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to think about their skills and experiences? 

User: I guess I’d tell them that they have value and their experiences matter, but it’s different when it’s about me.

Consultant: It’s really valuable that you can extend compassion to others. That’s a step forward. Now, can we work on recognizing and challenging these thoughts for yourself? What could be a more balanced way of viewing your skills?

User: Maybe I could think that I have relevant experiences, and that I’ve worked hard in school. But it’s just hard to believe that.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re starting to identify that you have valuable experiences. Sometimes it takes practice to shift your perspective. Let’s try to create a list of affirmations or statements that reinforce your value. What’s one positive thing you can tell yourself?

User: I guess I can say that I am graduating soon, which is an achievement in itself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Graduating is a significant accomplishment, and it shows your capability and hard work. Recognizing and celebrating small wins can help combat those feelings of self-doubt. As we continue, are there any specific strategies you would like to discuss to help with the anxiety and fear around job applications?

User: I’m not sure. I just want to be able to send a few resumes without feeling like I’ll go crazy.

Consultant: That’s a valid goal. How about we explore some gradual exposure techniques? We can break down the application process into smaller, more manageable steps. For instance, can we set a small goal to draft just one section of your resume today?

User: That sounds doable. Just focusing on one part could help, I guess.

Consultant: Great! Taking small steps can reduce overwhelm and build your confidence over time. Let’s also think about some self-care practices to help manage your anxiety. What activities do you enjoy that help you feel more relaxed?

User: I like reading and going for walks, but lately, I’ve hardly done either.

Consultant: Those activities are wonderful for reducing stress. Perhaps we could schedule some time for reading or walks into your week. Balancing your tasks with self-care is important. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I definitely need that balance.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue our work together, we can develop a more detailed plan for your resume and interview preparation. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed so far?

User: I feel a bit relieved, actually. It helps to talk about it and have a plan.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Having a plan can provide clarity and reduce anxiety. Let’s continue to build on this momentum. I’d like you to take a moment to reflect on what we’ve talked about today. What’s one thing you’d like to carry forward into our next session?

User: I think I want to focus on believing I have value and working on my resume little by little.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent focus. We’ll revisit it next time. I believe in you and your ability to work through this process. Remember, we’re in this together. What has been the most helpful part of our conversation today for you?

User: I think just feeling heard and knowing that I can take small steps. It’s less intimidating than I thought.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! I believe you’ll continue to find strength in those small steps. Let’s keep aiming toward enhancing your confidence and managing those feelings of inadequacy. I’m looking forward to seeing you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care until our next session, and remember to be kind to yourself.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I know you've been feeling uncertain about your abilities, especially while working on your resume. Can you share more about how that’s been affecting you lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I just feel so lost. Whenever I try to write my resume, I can't help but think I'm not good enough or that I’ll never find a job. It's really overwhelming, and it's starting to affect my study habits too.

Consultant: That sounds really tough to deal with. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when thinking about your future and job applications. What specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you sit down to work on your resume?

User: I just immediately start doubting myself. I think things like "I don’t have any valuable skills" or "I’ll mess up an interview anyway." It’s like a loop of negative thoughts.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts seem quite intense and can certainly lead to feelings of anxiety. Let's explore that a bit. When you think, "I don’t have any valuable skills," how does that make you feel, and what does it do to your motivation to work?

User: It makes me feel worthless and discouraged. I just want to avoid everything because it feels like I'm setting myself up for failure.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common response to those feelings. It’s like trying to protect yourself from potential disappointment. Do you think there's a possibility that your skills might be more valuable than you’re giving yourself credit for? 

User: I don’t know. I mean, I have some experience from my internship, but I keep thinking it doesn't count for much.

Consultant: It’s great that you have internship experience! That’s actually a valuable asset. Let’s try to challenge that thought together. If a friend came to you with similar doubts about their experience, what would you say to support them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has to start somewhere, and that their experiences are valid.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you recognize the importance of validating experiences for others. So, why not apply that same kindness to yourself? What might a more supportive thought look like for you when you think about your skills?

User: Maybe something like, "I have relevant experience and I can learn more." But it feels hard to believe.

Consultant: It can definitely take time to change how we think about ourselves. Let’s practice that supportive thought a bit. How would it feel to affirm that you have relevant experience and that you are capable of learning and growing from here?

User: It feels a bit less heavy. But I still worry about failing in interviews.

Consultant: That’s a completely normal fear. Let’s explore that concern. What would be the worst-case scenario in an interview, and how likely do you think that outcome really is?

User: I guess the worst would be completely freezing up and not being able to answer any questions. But I’ve seen people handle tough interviews and still get jobs.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that many people face challenges during interviews and still succeed. If you were to see yourself in that interview situation, how do you think you might handle it differently with the skills and experiences you’ve had?

User: I suppose I could prepare and practice responses ahead of time. It might help to boost my confidence too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Preparation can significantly improve your confidence and performance. Would you like to set small goals for practicing answers to common interview questions this week?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I’ll try to write down some common questions and practice my responses.

Consultant: It sounds like a solid plan! Let’s also focus on recognizing any small successes you have while preparing. How might you celebrate your progress, no matter how small?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with something I enjoy, like watching a favorite show after practicing.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely incentive! Celebrating those small victories can reinforce positive feelings about your progress. As we wrap up today, what stands out to you from our conversation?

User: I think I realized that I’m being way too hard on myself and that I do have some good skills. I need to work on changing my perspective.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Remember, changing how you view yourself takes time, but you've taken a positive step today. How do you feel about coming back next time to share how your practice went and any other thoughts you’ve had?

User: I think that would be good. I want to keep working on this.

Consultant: Wonderful! I look forward to our next session. Just remember, it’s a journey and every step you take is valuable. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling really down about that mock interview I did. I stumbled a lot, and it just makes me feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like you're feeling pretty critical of yourself right now. Let's explore that. What specific thoughts have you been having about your performance during the mock interview?

User: Well, I keep replaying the parts where I got confused and blurted out things that didn't make sense. I keep thinking that if I can't do well in a simulation, how will I perform in a real interview?

Consultant: It sounds very frustrating to relive those moments. You're expressing a worry about your future performance based on this one experience. Can you tell me what emotions those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel anxious and worthless. I mean, I should be better at this by now, especially since I'm about to graduate.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that pressure, especially with graduation approaching. Let’s focus on that anxiety for a moment. What do you wish would change about how you're feeling right now?

User: I wish I could just stop worrying so much and feel more confident in my interviewing skills.

Consultant: That's a great goal. Building confidence can really help ease that anxiety. Reflecting on the mock interview, were there any aspects where you did feel you handled things well?

User: I guess I did manage to answer a couple of questions okay, but I mostly fixate on the mistakes.

Consultant: It's common to focus more on the negatives, but recognizing those moments of success is important too. Perhaps we can reframe your mistakes as learning opportunities. What do you think you could learn from this experience?

User: I suppose I could see what I often struggle with and try to practice those areas more. 

Consultant: That sounds constructive. Creating a plan to address those challenges might lead to improvement. How do you feel about trying to do some mock interviews with a friend to build your comfort?

User: It might help, but I still feel nervous about it. What if I mess up again?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about practicing. However, remember that mistakes can happen to anyone, and they’re part of the learning process. How might you respond to a friend if they confided in you about their nerves in a similar scenario?

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that they’re just part of getting better.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! It shows you already understand this concept. Now, how can you apply that same kindness to yourself? 

User: I guess I need to remind myself that it’s normal to mess up and that I can improve.

Consultant: Exactly! Changing the narrative you tell yourself can be powerful. Let's also consider some relaxation techniques you can try before interviews to help manage anxiety. How about deep breathing exercises? 

User: I've heard of those but never really tried them.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be quite effective. By taking slow, deep breaths, you can calm your nervous system. Would you like to practice a simple technique together?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try it. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and then exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? 

User: Okay! *takes a deep breath* 

Consultant: Well done! How did that feel?

User: It felt nice to focus on my breathing for a moment.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Practicing that before interviews can help ground you in the moment. As we wrap up today, what’s one concrete step you feel ready to take before our next session?

User: I think I’ll try to do some mock interviews with a friend and practice deep breathing beforehand. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remember to be gentle with yourself and provide encouragement just as you would for someone else. You’ve made great strides today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better about it all now. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session today. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident after the alumni talk. I really tried to express my thoughts clearly, and I got some good feedback, which made me feel happy.

Consultant: That sounds great! It seems like you're starting to see the positive impact of sharing your thoughts. How did it feel to receive that feedback?

User: It felt really encouraging! I was so nervous before speaking, but when I heard positive responses, it was a relief. I realized I could communicate better than I thought.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're recognizing your ability to communicate effectively. What changes have you noticed in your thinking about your communication skills since then?

User: I think I'm beginning to believe that I can express myself well. Before, I often thought I wasn’t good at it, but now I feel like I can do it if I try.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your thinking! Developing this positive belief in yourself is essential for your confidence. Are there any situations where you've been able to apply this new mindset?

User: Yes, I tried to share my opinions in a group project afterward. I felt nervous, but I remember the positive feedback from the talk, and it helped me speak up.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example of putting your new belief into action! How did that experience compare to how you felt about speaking up in the past?

User: It felt much better! Last time, I would have held back and doubted myself. But this time, I felt a bit excited to share my ideas.

Consultant: Feeling excited instead of fearful is a fantastic development. Can you recognize what factors contributed to this excitement?

User: I think knowing that my thoughts could be valuable to others made a difference. Also, the positive reactions helped boost my mood.

Consultant: That's insightful! It shows you are beginning to see the value you bring to others, which can further enhance your self-worth. How do you think participating in more activities could impact your confidence over time?

User: I believe it could help me feel more connected to others and reinforce the idea that I have something worthwhile to contribute.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in social activities can strengthen that connection and boost your confidence. What new activities can you think of getting involved in that could facilitate this growth?

User: I might join a club or participate in more discussion groups. It sounds like a good way to practice and meet new people.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Joining clubs can provide a supportive environment for you to share your thoughts and experiences. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel excited about it! Although I'm a bit nervous, I think it will be a good opportunity for me to grow.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Embracing those feelings while stepping outside your comfort zone is an important part of the process. How can you prepare yourself mentally before these activities?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the positive experiences I've had recently and think about what I want to share.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Remembering positive past experiences can help reduce anxiety. Would it also be helpful to set small goals for each activity?

User: Yes, that might help. I could aim to speak up at least once in each meeting or share a thought when I feel ready.

Consultant: Setting small, attainable goals can indeed make the experience less overwhelming. How will you track your progress in these activities?

User: I could keep a journal or write notes after each activity to reflect on how I felt and what I achieved.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent idea! It will help you see your growth over time and reinforce those positive experiences. What do you think you might write about after your first activity?

User: I think I would write about how I felt before, during, and after speaking, and note any positive feedback or thoughts I received.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Reflecting on those experiences will reinforce your confidence. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you have from our conversation?

User: I feel more motivated to participate in activities and believe that I can do it. I also understand the importance of reflecting on my experiences.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway! Engaging in activities and reflecting on your journey will definitely strengthen your confidence and sense of self-worth. I believe you are on the right path. If you ever need support as you navigate these experiences, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and encouragement. I’ll definitely keep these strategies in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and remember to celebrate your progress!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today. It's wonderful to know that you've found some value in your recent volunteer activities. How have you been feeling about yourself since participating in those events?

User: Hi! I feel really good about myself lately. Helping others during the volunteer activities made me realize that I can make a difference, and it boosted my self-esteem.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It's great that you're recognizing the positive impact you're having. Can you share more about how these experiences have shifted your view of yourself?

User: I used to doubt my abilities a lot, thinking I wasn't good enough at anything. But now, after volunteering, I feel like I’m capable of helping and that I really do have something to offer.

Consultant: It sounds like these experiences have truly opened your eyes to your strengths. It’s important to recognize and celebrate that change. Are there any specific skills or abilities you discovered through volunteering?

User: Yes, I found that I can communicate well with others, and I actually enjoyed organizing some of the activities. I didn’t realize I had that talent.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Discovering new strengths can be incredibly empowering. How do you think you can continue to build on these skills moving forward?

User: I think I want to keep volunteering, maybe get involved in organizing more events. I feel like I can learn more about leadership through those experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Regular involvement in volunteering could really help in solidifying that sense of self-worth you've gained. What other areas do you think you’d like to explore as you continue this journey?

User: I’d like to focus on finding a job related to social work or community service. I feel drawn to helping out in a professional setting now.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive direction to take! Combining your newfound self-confidence with a passion for helping others could lead to a fulfilling career. What steps do you think you can take to start exploring job opportunities in that field?

User: I guess I could start researching local organizations and see what positions are available. I might also reach out to some of the contacts I made during my volunteer work.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Networking and reaching out can often open doors. As you think about these potential job opportunities, what feelings come up for you? 

User: I feel slightly anxious about it, but mostly excited. I don't want to fail, but I also don't want to miss out on a chance to do something meaningful.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety when considering new opportunities. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge that fear of failure you mentioned. What thoughts do you have about this fear?

User: I often think that maybe I won’t be good at it or that I’ll let others down. It’s like that old negative belief creeping back in.

Consultant: Those negative beliefs can be challenging to shake off, especially when they’ve been part of your mindset for a long time. Let's work together to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports your abilities and potential success?

User: I guess my volunteering experience shows that I can contribute positively. The feedback I received was heartwarming too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your volunteering experience is direct evidence of your capability. If you were to encourage a friend who felt the same fear, what would you say to them?

User: I would tell them that everyone has to start somewhere and that it’s okay to learn and grow through the process.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! You deserve to give yourself the same grace and understanding. How can you remind yourself of this as you step into new opportunities?

User: I suppose I could keep a journal of my experiences and the positive feedback I get. It might help me to look back on those moments when I'm feeling doubtful.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a wonderful idea! It can serve as a tangible reminder of your growth and achievements. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the journey ahead and your ability to maintain this positive self-view?

User: I feel more confident about it now. I have a better understanding of how to manage my thoughts and keep reminding myself of my strengths.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It seems like you’re well on your way to solidifying your self-worth. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support if you ever need it in this journey. I'm glad we could talk today and explore these steps together. How are you feeling about our conversation?

User: I feel really good! It’s nice to reflect on my progress and get some strategies to keep moving forward.

Consultant: I’m pleased to hear that! You’ve made tremendous strides, and I believe in your continued growth. Whenever you need further support, I’m here to help. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to have you here. How are you feeling as you embark on this new chapter in your professional life?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite excited, to be honest. I just got an internship after passing the interview, and it feels like a big step forward for me. But at the same time, I've been reflecting on my past and wondering how to maintain my mental well-being through this transition.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant milestone for you! It’s completely natural to feel a mix of excitement and concern about the future. Can you share a bit more about how you're planning to manage this transition while keeping your mental health in check?

User: I'm trying to stay positive and prepared. I want to apply what I've learned about managing my emotions, but sometimes I worry if I'm really ready for this change. My past experiences make me doubt myself from time to time.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re taking proactive steps towards staying positive. It’s also understandable that past experiences can cause doubt. Let's explore some of those thoughts further. What specific doubts or fears have come up for you regarding this internship?

User: I often think about the pressure to perform well. I fear that I might not meet expectations, and that thought really stresses me out. It makes me question if I deserve this opportunity.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a significant amount of pressure you’re placing on yourself. I’d like to hear more about those expectations—what kind of thoughts or beliefs do you have about your performance?

User: I keep thinking things like, “What if I mess up?” or “They made a mistake hiring me.” My mind just jumps to the worst-case scenarios, and then I feel anxious about the whole thing.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be very overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you will mess up or that they made a mistake in hiring you?

User: Well, I don't have much evidence. I prepared really hard for the interview, and I was able to answer all the questions. It's just these fears that creep in, especially when I think about what’s at stake.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight. It seems that while you’ve prepared and succeeded in the interview, there’s still a part of you that is struggling with self-doubt. How might you reframe those thoughts to focus on your strengths and accomplishments instead?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I earned this opportunity due to my efforts. I mean, I worked really hard to get here, so I should trust that I can handle what comes next.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift in thinking! Focusing on your strengths and what you've achieved can help reduce that anxiety. Are there specific affirmations or statements you could create to encourage yourself during this internship?

User: I could say things like, “I am capable and well-prepared” or “I deserve this opportunity.” I think repeating those could help me stay grounded.

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! By reinforcing positive messages, you create a healthier mindset. Can we discuss how you might incorporate these affirmations into your daily routine as you begin your internship?

User: I think I could start every morning by saying them out loud to myself, maybe while I'm getting ready. That sounds like a good way to set the tone for the day.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Reinforcing positive thoughts regularly can empower you as you navigate new challenges. How do you feel about creating a plan to check in with yourself weekly to assess your progress and adjust as needed?

User: I like that idea! It would help me stay accountable and aware of my feelings. I could reflect on how I’ve been doing and whether I need to adjust my affirmations or strategies.

Consultant: Fantastic! Keeping track of your feelings and experiences is an important part of maintaining your mental health. What aspects of your internship are you most looking forward to? 

User: I’m really excited to meet new coworkers and learn new things! I think I’ll enjoy being part of a team and contributing to projects.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Engaging with coworkers can provide you with a supportive network. How can you ensure you maintain that positivity and connection with your teammates during this process?

User: I could reach out to them, ask questions, and share my thoughts. I believe being open and engaging can foster a good atmosphere and help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Being open and connecting with others will certainly help build a positive environment for you. As we wrap up, what’s one takeaway from our conversation that you think will be most helpful as you begin this new journey?

User: I think focusing on my strengths and using my affirmations are key takeaways. And also remembering that it’s okay to feel nervous; it doesn’t define my abilities.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing both your strengths and your feelings is essential. You've made great progress today, and I believe you have the tools to navigate this transition effectively. If you ever need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more prepared and less anxious about starting my internship. I appreciate your help in sorting through my thoughts.

Consultant: It was my pleasure! I’m glad I could help you feel more confident. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support. Good luck, and take care of yourself!

User: Thank you! I will. Goodbye!
