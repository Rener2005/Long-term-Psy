Consultant: Hello, Jacob! I'm really glad you're here today. How are you feeling about our session?

User: Hi. I'm not sure. I guess I feel a bit nervous about talking. I just don’t like it when people are around me too much.

Consultant: I understand, and it's completely okay to feel that way. Do you want to tell me more about why you feel uncomfortable when people are close?

User: Well, there was this trip to the farm, and I didn’t want to play with anyone. I didn't even want to touch the animals. It just felt weird.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite challenging for you. Can you share what you were thinking when you were at the farm? What made you feel weird?

User: I thought the animals might bite me, and all the noise from the kids was too loud for me. I just wanted to be alone.

Consultant: That makes sense. You were feeling overwhelmed by the noise and the animals. Let’s explore this a bit—when you think about those noises and animals, how does it make you feel inside? 

User: It makes me feel scared and really frustrated. I don’t like when things are loud or when I have to be close to people.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Jacob. It sounds like loud noises and being close to others can be very stressful for you. Do you ever think about what those fears say about you or what you believe will happen?

User: I think if I get too close, something bad might happen, or people might not like me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're worried about being close to others and possibly being judged. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that being close to people will lead to something bad?

User: I... I don’t know. I just feel it often, but I guess I've never actually been hurt.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Jacob! It seems like those feelings are based more on worries than reality. What if we looked for some experiences where being with people felt okay or even fun? 

User: I remember one time I played tag, and I wasn’t scared. It was actually fun! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remembering a positive experience like tag shows that not all interactions are scary. How could we try to create similar experiences in your daily life?

User: Maybe we could play games at school with some friends. But what if they don’t want to play with me?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might feel scary to approach others. What if, instead of thinking they won’t want to play, we think of ways to connect gradually, like saying “hi” first?

User: I could say "hi" and see if they smile back. 

Consultant: Exactly, Jacob! It’s a small step that can lead to something more. What other activities might you feel excited to do with classmates?

User: Maybe drawing or showing them my toys. I like those things, and they are fun.

Consultant: Drawing and sharing toys are great ways to connect! Using things you enjoy can help you feel more comfortable. How about we brainstorm some specific drawings you might want to share?

User: I could draw my favorite animals. Everyone likes animals! 

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Drawing animals can be a super fun conversation starter. How do you feel about the idea of sharing your drawings with classmates?

User: I feel a little better about it. It seems less scary.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jacob! It sounds like incorporating things you enjoy into your interactions might help reduce the anxiety you feel. Would you like to share what your next step will be at school?

User: I think I’ll try to say “hi” and show someone my drawings next week. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, it’s okay to take it at your pace. We can also establish a “what if” plan together. If it feels difficult, what can you remind yourself about your feelings?

User: I can remember that it’s just feeling and that nothing really bad has happened before.

Consultant: Exactly! Those reminders can be very helpful. So, before we finish today, let’s talk about how you can feel more prepared for this school experience. How can you feel proud of taking that step?

User: Maybe I can tell my parents about it and let them cheer for me after I do it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing your plan with your parents can provide you with extra support and encouragement. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I think I learned more about why I feel scared and how to deal with it. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Jacob! You’ve made great progress today. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re taking important steps forward. I look forward to hearing how your week goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jacob! Welcome to our session today. Before we start, I'd like to hear a bit about what's been going on with you recently. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. I feel like nobody gets me. Sometimes I just want to have fun my own way, but then I get in trouble. Like the other day, I broke a window in class because I was trying to do a puzzle with the glass pieces.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you wanted to explore something in your unique way, but it ended up causing a problem. Can you tell me what you were thinking when you decided to do that?

User: I just wanted to make something cool! The teacher got really mad, though. I thought it would be fun.

Consultant: It sounds like you were excited about your idea, but it didn’t turn out the way you hoped. How did that make you feel when your teacher got mad?

User: I felt sad and a bit scared. I didn’t mean to upset anyone, but I thought everyone would like it.

Consultant: That must have been tough for you. You wanted to share something fun, but it ended up causing trouble. Let’s talk about what rules in class might help you share your ideas without getting in trouble. What do you think?

User: Well, maybe if I ask first, it would be okay? But I don't always want to do that...

Consultant: Asking permission is a good start! It can help you express your creativity while also respecting the rules. What do you feel when you think about asking to try your ideas first?

User: I feel a bit nervous. What if they say no? They never seem to like what I want to do.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous about that. What if we tried to think of some reasons why your ideas might be liked instead? Can you think of a time when someone enjoyed what you created or shared?

User: Um, I remember when I made a big drawing in art class and everyone said it looked cool! I felt really happy then.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You’ve shown you can create something that others enjoy. How do you think you could use that positive experience to help you when thinking about your ideas in class?

User: Maybe I can remember that they’ve liked my art before, so I can feel more confident sharing my ideas?

Consultant: Exactly! You can remind yourself of the times when your creativity was appreciated. Let's practice a scenario together. Imagine you have a new idea for a project. How would you approach your teacher to share it?

User: I guess I would say, “I have an idea, can I show you?”

Consultant: That sounds great! You're being confident while also respecting the teacher's role. How do you feel about giving that a try next time?

User: I feel a little brave thinking about it. But what if they still don’t like it?

Consultant: It’s okay to feel uncertain. Remember, feedback is just part of learning. Even if they say no, it doesn’t mean your idea isn’t good. You can always try again. Does that help ease your worries?

User: Yeah, a bit. I guess I can try not to be sad if they say no.

Consultant: That's a valuable approach. Let’s also think about how you can deal with those feelings of sadness if they come up. What can you do to feel better afterward?

User: I think I can draw or play with my brothers. That usually helps me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Engaging in activities you enjoy can be a great way to lift your mood. How does that make you feel thinking about having a backup plan?

User: It makes me feel like I have options, and I won’t have to be alone with my sadness.

Consultant: Exactly! Having options empowers you. Over time, this can help strengthen your connection with others too. Speaking of connections, how do you feel about being part of group activities or playing with your classmates?

User: Sometimes, I don’t really want to join in. It seems like they have their own fun, and I just feel left out.

Consultant: It sounds like you might feel a bit isolated sometimes. Let's explore this further. What do you think stops you from joining in on their activities?

User: I don’t know...maybe I think they won’t want me there or they’ll laugh at me.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. Do you think those thoughts are based on something real, or could they be a bit exaggerated?

User: I guess they might be exaggerated. Sometimes they play games that I like too.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! You have common interests with them. How do you think you could overcome that fear and take a small step to join in next time?

User: Maybe I could just try to ask if I can play with them once. Just to see what happens.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! A small step can help you feel more comfortable. How does the idea of asking to join make you feel now?

User: It feels exciting! I think it would be okay to try it.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, taking those small steps can lead to even bigger connections. How can we support you in remembering to take that action?

User: I can write myself a note! “Try to ask to join a game.”

Consultant: I love that idea! Writing a note can remind you of your goal. What else do you want to work on in our next session to keep this momentum going?

User: I want to practice more ideas for talking to others and try to join in for real!

Consultant: Excellent! We’ll practice more scenarios together, and I’ll support you as you take steps toward connecting with others. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel hopeful! Thank you for helping me today!

Consultant: You're welcome, Jacob! I’m really proud of you for sharing your thoughts. We'll carry this momentum into our next session. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jacob! I'm glad to see you today. Before we begin, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I don't feel much different. I still prefer being alone and it's hard for me to join in when my friends are playing. I just want to feel okay around other kids.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Jacob. It’s understandable to feel uncomfortable in social situations sometimes. Can you tell me a bit more about what happens when you try to join in?

User: Well, I just feel like everyone is going to look at me or laugh at me. So, I just sit by myself and finish lunch quickly.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts are making you feel anxious. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable when you’re with other kids?

User: Maybe if I knew what to say or do, it wouldn’t be so scary. But I don’t really know how to start.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Jacob. Knowing what to say or do can make a big difference. How about we explore some simple actions or phrases you can use in those situations? 

User: Sure. That sounds good.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's use a social story approach to make it easier. Imagine you’re at lunch, and you see your friends playing. What could you say to join them?

User: I could say, “Can I play too?” but I don’t know if I would actually say it.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Let’s break it down. If you were in that moment, what might help you feel brave enough to say that?

User: Maybe if I took a deep breath first? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a deep breath can help calm those anxious feelings. Let's practice that together. Imagine you’re at lunch. You breathe in... and out. Now, what would you say?

User: “Can I play too?”

Consultant: Great job, Jacob! How do you feel saying that out loud, even just to me?

User: I feel a bit better. Not as nervous. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step forward! Now, how about we think of a situation where you can practice this? Maybe at your next lunch or art activity?

User: Yeah, I have art class on Friday. I could try then.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Participating in something you love can make it easier to connect with others. How about we think of another way to start a conversation during art class?

User: I could ask someone what they are making?

Consultant: Exactly! Asking questions is a great way to help you feel included. Can you think of any other questions you might feel comfortable asking?

User: Maybe, “Do you like drawing?” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent question, Jacob! It shows interest and opens up the conversation. How do you feel about using these strategies in art class?

User: I think it could work. I just need to remember to breathe and say something.

Consultant: Yes! Remember, you’ve got this. Practicing these small steps can build up your confidence. Would you like to set a small goal for this week related to your art class?

User: I want to try to talk to at least one person.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Jacob! Focusing on one conversation is achievable. How will you feel after attempting this?

User: I might feel proud of myself if I do it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling proud is so important. And remember, even if it feels challenging, that’s part of the learning process. What else do you think could help you this week leading up to art class?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. 

Consultant: Yes, reminding yourself that it’s normal to feel nervous can also help a lot. Would it help to visualize yourself having a good conversation before class?

User: Yeah, that could work. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Visualizing can prepare you for success. As we wrap up today, what are some key takeaways from our session that you want to remember?

User: I’ll remember to breathe, try to ask a question, and that it’s okay to feel nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent points, Jacob. You've shown great insight today. How do you feel about our progress in building your social skills?

User: I feel like I’m making progress, even if it’s small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress, no matter how small, is significant. I'm looking forward to hearing how your art class goes. Remember, you can always practice these strategies. I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you! I'll see you next time.

Consultant: You're welcome, Jacob! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jacob! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your art activities and group interactions lately?

User: Hi! I've been really enjoying art class. I feel focused and calm when I'm painting or listening to music. But when we're in group activities, I still feel a bit shy and passive.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel focused and calm during art class! That’s a wonderful strength. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy in those art activities? 

User: I just love how I can express myself and create something beautiful. It’s like I can forget about everything else!

Consultant: That sounds really special! Art seems to be a great outlet for you. Now, when you're in group activities, what makes you feel shy or passive? 

User: I think I get nervous because I’m not sure what to say or do, and I worry that my ideas aren’t good enough.

Consultant: I understand. It’s quite common to feel nervous about sharing ideas in a group. If you think of a time when you felt confident while expressing yourself in art, how did that feel compared to group activities? 

User: When I’m in art class, I feel proud when my work is appreciated. But in group activities, I don’t feel that same support.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It sounds like the appreciation you receive in art really boosts your confidence. What do you think could help you feel more supported in group activities?

User: Maybe if someone encouraged me or if we all shared our ideas together first, I could feel less scared.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Encouragement can really make a difference. How about we think of some ways you could encourage others in your group? That might help build confidence for you as well.

User: I guess I could start by complimenting someone's idea or asking them questions about it.

Consultant: Yes, that sounds wonderful! Complimenting others can create a positive atmosphere and might also help you feel more comfortable sharing your thoughts. How do you think you’d feel trying that out?

User: I think it would make me feel good because I’d be helping others feel good too.

Consultant: Absolutely, and helping others can help you feel more connected! Let’s say next time you’re in a group activity, you compliment at least one person. How would you plan to do that?

User: I would probably wait until someone shares their idea and then say something nice about it. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. And how about before those group activities, what could you remind yourself of to calm your nerves?

User: I could tell myself that my ideas are valuable too, just like everyone else’s.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder! Recognizing the value of your own ideas is key. How do you feel about incorporating that reminder before the next group activity?

User: I feel excited. I think reminding myself might really help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Excitement is a great feeling to have. Now, let’s think about how we can set a small goal for you regarding group activities. What would you like to aim for?

User: I want to try to speak up at least once during our next group activity.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Speaking up once is a great start. How will you celebrate that achievement afterwards, no matter the outcome?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to some extra time painting afterward. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful reward! Connecting what you love with your goals can be really powerful. As we move forward, I want you to remember that each little step counts. Would you like to share how you think your classmates might respond to your courage in speaking up?

User: I hope they’ll think my ideas are good and start talking to me more.

Consultant: That’s a positive thought! Building connections with your classmates can enhance your group experience. Do you have a buddy in class you feel comfortable with, whom you could also talk to about how you’re feeling?

User: Yes, I have a friend named Emma; she's really nice!

Consultant: Great! Maybe you could share your goals with Emma. She might support you during group activities. How do you feel about discussing this with her?

User: I feel like she would be excited to help me out!

Consultant: That sounds promising! Having support is so valuable. Lastly, how have you felt about our session today? 

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try new things!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jacob! I’m really proud of you for being open to trying. Remember, you’re building connections, and each mindful step will help you grow in those group settings. If you encounter challenges, we’ll work through them together. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to next time! 

Consultant: You're welcome, Jacob! Keep practicing those steps, and I can't wait to hear how it goes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jacob! I'm glad to see you again. I want to check in on how you've been feeling since our last session. How are you doing today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better. My classmates were really supportive when I helped the teacher with the art class activity. It made me feel good.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your classmates appreciated your help. How did that experience make you feel about being part of the team?

User: I felt happy and included. It's nice to feel like I belong, especially when everyone was encouraging me.

Consultant: It's great that you felt included and supported. It sounds like this positive feedback from your classmates has motivated you to participate more. Do you think this experience has changed how you view group activities?

User: Yes, I think it's easier for me now. I used to feel nervous about joining in, but being chosen made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift, Jacob! Feeling more confident can really help you enjoy those activities more. Can you tell me what you enjoyed the most about working with your classmates during the art activity?

User: I liked that we got to create something together. It was fun to see how everyone contributed different ideas, and I felt proud of what we made.

Consultant: Collaboration can be incredibly rewarding, especially when you see the result of everyone’s efforts. Have you thought about other activities where you might like to contribute in a similar way?

User: Maybe during the next science project? I could help out as a team member again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Helping out in your next group project could further build your confidence. How do you feel about taking on that role?

User: I feel good about it! I want to try to speak up more and share my ideas this time.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Sharing your ideas can really enhance your contribution to the team. What do you think might help you feel even more comfortable speaking up during the project?

User: Maybe if I practice what I want to say beforehand, I wouldn't feel so nervous.

Consultant: Practicing is an excellent strategy! It can help you feel prepared. Would you like to role-play what you might say during the project discussion? 

User: Yes! That sounds helpful. I can practice telling my classmates what I think we should do.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine you’re in the group now. How would you start sharing your idea?

User: I could say, “I think we should try this experiment because it’s interesting, and I have some ideas on how to do it.”

Consultant: That’s a strong start, Jacob! Inviting others to hear your thoughts shows confidence. How do you feel practicing that out loud?

User: A little nervous, but it feels good to say it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous, but you’re doing a fantastic job by practicing. Remember, your classmates likely want to hear what you have to say. Do you have any concerns about this upcoming science project?

User: I worry that if they don’t like my idea, I might feel bad.

Consultant: That concern is understandable, but it’s important to remember that everyone has different opinions, and that doesn't reflect on you as a person. What could help you manage that feeling if it happens?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to have different ideas and that I can always contribute in other ways.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s great to have different perspectives in a group. Focusing on being part of the team and learning from the experience can be very valuable. Are you ready to embrace this new challenge with your classmates?

User: Yes, I think I am! It feels good to talk about it and get support.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Jacob. You’ve made wonderful progress in feeling more comfortable in group settings. To wrap up, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this confidence moving forward?

User: I will practice my thoughts, remind myself it’s okay to share different ideas, and keep talking to you for support.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Jacob! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, you can always come back for further support whenever you need it. It’s been great working with you on this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and will see you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jacob! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your recent classes and activities?

User: Hi. I feel pretty good! I’m getting along better with my classmates, and I even joined in some group activities without feeling scared.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear you’re feeling more comfortable participating. Can you tell me more about what activities you enjoyed doing with your classmates?

User: I can think of all the good times I had with my friends, like singing and painting. Maybe I can also talk to you if I get worried.

User: Bye!
