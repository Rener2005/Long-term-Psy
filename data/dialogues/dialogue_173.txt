Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fang! It’s good to see you here today. I want to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with your schoolwork and any concerns you might have.

User: Hi. I've been really stressed about my schoolwork. I just had mid-term exams, and I didn't do as well as I hoped. It’s been hard to focus on my homework, and I often end up folding paper or reading something else instead.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been feeling quite overwhelmed with everything going on. Would you say that feeling pressure from your exams has made it harder to complete your homework? What do you think about that?

User: Yes, exactly. I start to do my homework, but then I get distracted really easily. Sometimes I feel like I can't get started, and then I just feel bad about not finishing it on time.

Consultant: I understand. It’s tough when distractions make things feel more stressful. How does that distraction affect your feelings about school and your homework? 

User: It makes me feel even more anxious. I worry that I won't finish my assignments, and then my mom gets upset, which makes things worse at home.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure coming from different directions, both from your schoolwork and at home. Can you tell me a little more about how that makes you feel day-to-day?

User: It feels really heavy. I wish I could just enjoy my projects, but I feel like I’m always running out of time. I get really anxious if I think about not finishing on time, especially when it’s a group project.

Consultant: I can see how that would be stressful—feeling rushed and worried about group work. What do you think might help you feel a bit more in control of your time when you have these projects? 

User: I don't know. I think I need to plan better, but I just keep putting it off. I guess I also feel guilty if I’m not doing my part.

Consultant: It’s really important to recognize those feelings of guilt. We can work together on some simple time management strategies that might help you feel less anxious and more organized. What if we started by breaking down your projects into smaller, manageable tasks?

User: That could help. I think if I could see what I need to do step by step, it might not feel so overwhelming. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! By breaking it down, you can tackle one thing at a time. How do you usually like to organize your tasks? 

User: I usually just keep it in my head, but that doesn't work well. Maybe I should write it down. 

Consultant: Writing things down can be really helpful! It can clear your mind and give you a visual plan. Would you feel comfortable trying to write down the steps for your next project during our session today?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I'm just worried I won't stick to it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It takes practice. We can also think about setting up a small routine for checking your progress. What if you set a specific time each day to review your tasks?

User: That sounds good. If I have a time set for it, maybe I won’t forget.

Consultant: Exactly! Setting aside that time can create a habit. Remember, it’s also okay to ask for help if you’re feeling stuck or anxious. How does that make you feel? 

User: That makes me feel a bit better. I guess it’s nice to know I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: Definitely, you’re not alone. Everyone struggles sometimes with similar feelings. Let’s make a plan now. How about writing down your tasks, and then we can brainstorm what time you’d like to check in on them?

User: Okay! I’ll write down my key tasks for the group project, and then I think checking in every evening could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As you work through these tasks, what can you remind yourself to help manage that anxiety about completing them?

User: I can remind myself that I just need to take it one step at a time. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s a perfect mindset. Taking it step by step can help lessen that overwhelming feeling. Are there any other feelings you notice, especially when you think about your group project?

User: I still feel guilty about holding my group back. I don’t want to disappoint them.

Consultant: It’s great that you care about your group! Remember, they’re all working together too. What’s one way you can communicate with them if you feel overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could just send a message and let them know I’m working on my part and ask if they need help from me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Communication is key in teamwork. It’s okay to reach out for support. Moving forward, how do you feel about this approach? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think having a plan will make things easier. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Fang. It sounds like you have a clearer path ahead. How would you like to check in with me next time to see how these strategies are working for you?

User: I think I’ll share how it’s been going with my projects and what’s worked for me.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! We can discuss your progress and any adjustments you might need. Remember, you've got this, and I’m here to support you along the way. 

User: Thanks. I appreciate it!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I’m really glad to see you today. I understand you’ve been feeling anxious about your group project at school. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I’m really worried. I feel like there’s so much to do and I might not finish it on time. I keep thinking that my group members will be disappointed in me if I can’t contribute enough.

Consultant: It sounds like that pressure to meet deadlines and deliver for your group is weighing on you. When you think about this project, what specific thoughts come to mind that make you feel anxious?

User: I keep thinking of all the tasks I need to do, and I just freeze. I feel guilty because I know my teammates are depending on me, but I get so distracted with other things, like reading or folding paper.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the added pressure of teamwork. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What do you tell yourself that makes you feel guilty or anxious about the project?

User: I think things like “What if I let everyone down?” or “I’m not good enough to do this.” Those thoughts really make me panic.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiaofang. Those are strong thoughts and it’s normal to feel overwhelmed by them. But let's consider this: how often do you actually let your teammates down? Can you think of times when you’ve successfully contributed?

User: Well, there were times when I did help out, but somehow, those negative thoughts are louder. I just can’t shake off the fear.

Consultant: I get that. It’s easy for our minds to amplify the negative while downplaying our achievements. What if we tried to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them? For example, could there be other interpretations to those thoughts, like “I might not be perfect, but my contributions do matter”?

User: That does sound better, but it’s hard to believe that when I’m feeling stressed.

Consultant: It can be tough, especially when emotions run high. How about we practice turning those thoughts around when they pop up? I could help you create a little phrase to remind yourself that you are indeed capable.

User: That could help. I would like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s work on a positive affirmation together. Something like, “I can handle my tasks step by step, and my group can rely on me.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think repeating something like that might help.

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! Now, along with managing your thoughts, let’s talk about organizing your time for the project. How do you usually plan out your homework or tasks?

User: I usually just try to do everything in one go, but it doesn't work out well because I get distracted.

Consultant: It seems like breaking things down might be beneficial. What if we set small, manageable goals and time slots for each task related to the project? This can help you stay focused and reduce anxiety.

User: That makes sense! I could try working in shorter periods instead of all at once.

Consultant: Exactly! We can start with 25-minute segments, followed by a 5-minute break. Would you like to try this method for your project tasks?

User: Yes, I’d like to give it a shot. It sounds like a more relaxed way to work.

Consultant: Awesome! We’ll also want to keep checking in on how you feel before and after each session. If you notice any anxious thoughts creeping back in, remember to challenge them with your new positive statement.

User: I will! I think this might actually help me feel better about managing my work.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s a step-by-step process. Let’s also consider how we can build your confidence in team settings. Have you shared your ideas with your team before?

User: Sometimes, but I worry they won’t like my ideas, so I often keep quiet.

Consultant: I understand that fear. But your ideas and contributions are important! How about we practice how to voice your thoughts? We could role play a scenario where you share an idea with your team.

User: That would be helpful! I think it would give me more confidence if I practiced.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s say you’ve thought of a solution for the project. How would you start sharing it with your teammates?

User: I’d probably say something like “I have an idea we could try…” but I wouldn’t sound very confident.

Consultant: That's a great start! Adding a sentence to express confidence can change how you present your ideas. How about saying, “I have a solution that I think could really help our project”?

User: That does sound more confident! I’ll practice that.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, every time you express your ideas, you’re making progress. Each time will get easier. Ready to commit to voicing your ideas next time you meet your group?

User: Yes! I’ll definitely try it out, especially with the new structure and mindset.

Consultant: I’m proud of you, Xiaofang! You’re taking important steps toward overcoming this anxiety and improving your time management. For our next session, let’s discuss how it went with the group and your progress with the time management technique.

User: I’m looking forward to it! Thanks for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I believe in your ability to manage your tasks and contribute to your team. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about your schoolwork lately?

User: Hi. I've been really stressed about my new Chinese reading assignments. They seem so overwhelming, and I don't know where to start. I worry I won't meet my parents' expectations.

Consultant: I can see how that would be stressful for you. It sounds like you're feeling pressured by both the assignments and your parents' expectations. Let’s take a moment to explore what specifically feels overwhelming about the reading tasks.

User: Well, the tasks seem really complicated, and I feel like I have to read a lot, but then I get distracted and start doing other things, like reading books I enjoy or folding paper. It feels like I'm never getting anything done.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when tasks seem daunting. Can you share a bit more about what happens when you sit down to start your reading homework?

User: I try to focus, but I get bored or anxious, and then I end up folding paper or reading something else. I just can't concentrate on the reading.

Consultant: That’s a common struggle, Xiaofang. It sounds like your mind is seeking out activities that are more enjoyable. How do you feel about breaking the reading tasks into smaller parts to help make them feel more manageable?

User: I guess that might help, but I'm not sure how to even start breaking them down. It still seems like a lot.

Consultant: Let’s work together on that! How about we take one of your reading assignments and divide it into smaller, specific steps? What would you like to focus on first?

User: I have to read a whole chapter for next week. Maybe I can at least break it down into smaller sections, like a few paragraphs at a time?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on a few paragraphs at a time can make the task feel less overwhelming. How about we set a goal for you to read just one or two paragraphs and then take a short break? 

User: I could try that! It sounds easier. But what if I can’t make it through even that?

Consultant: It's okay to feel uncertain. Remember, the goal here isn’t to perfect the task at hand but to make progress. If one or two paragraphs feels too much on a particular day, you can always adjust and start with just one. Would that sound like a comfortable way to approach it?

User: Yes, I think I can handle starting with just one paragraph. 

Consultant: Excellent! And after you've read those paragraphs, I encourage you to pay attention to how you feel. Really notice any sense of achievement you might have after completing that small step. How do you think that could help you?

User: Maybe if I notice I did something, it would motivate me to keep going instead of feeling stuck.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small successes can help build your confidence. Additionally, would you like to keep a simple record of your feelings after each task completion to see how your emotions change?

User: That could be helpful. I could write down what I felt after reading the paragraphs and if I felt good about it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Xiaofang! By tracking your feelings, you'll have a better understanding of your progress and how you can motivate yourself. What do you think you can do differently when you sit down to do your reading next time?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay to take small steps and that I can always read just one paragraph. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. Is there anything else you want to discuss today related to your reading or anything else?

User: I guess I feel a little confused about balancing my schoolwork with my other interests. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not doing enough for either.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Many students feel torn between their schoolwork and their hobbies. Let's explore how you can manage both more effectively. Perhaps we can set a schedule that allocates specific times for both school tasks and your interests. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds like it could work! I just need to figure out how to keep everything in balance.

Consultant: Great! To start, let’s outline a basic structure where you dedicate certain periods for homework, and right after that, schedule time for your interests. This way, you’re allowing yourself both responsibilities and enjoyment. What do you think?

User: I like that idea. It might help me feel more organized and less stressed.

Consultant: Absolutely! By having a schedule, you’ll gain more clarity, and hopefully, it will make both your homework and hobbies feel more enjoyable. How do you think you could arrange your time in a way that feels balanced to you?

User: Maybe I could study for an hour and then take a break to do something I enjoy afterward, like reading my favorite book or drawing. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic balance! Rewarding yourself with something you enjoy right after productive study time can make tackling your homework feel more rewarding. Are there any specific strategies or techniques we can discuss that could help you maintain this balance?

User: I think reminding myself that these little breaks are okay will be important. Also, maybe asking my parents to help me stick to the plan could work too.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Having your parents involved can provide additional support and accountability. It could also open communication about your feelings toward the workload. How do you feel about discussing your new plan with them?

User: I think I will. I hope they understand how I feel about the reading tasks. 

Consultant: I’m sure they will appreciate your honesty and your effort to communicate. By sharing your strategies and feelings, it opens up the opportunity for them to understand and support you better. 

User: Yeah, I really want to be able to manage everything better and not feel so pressured.

Consultant: That’s a positive goal! Continually evaluating and adjusting your plan will help you find what works best for you. You’re making great progress today, Xiaofang. How do you feel about the conversation we’ve had so far?

User: I feel much more hopeful about tackling my reading and managing my time. I like that I have some concrete steps to try.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’re already taking important steps toward feeling more confident and balanced. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we wrap up our session today?

User: No, I think I have everything I need for now. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaofang! Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. I’m looking forward to hearing how you implement these strategies in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your schoolwork and interest classes lately?

User: Hi, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I really want to do well in my studies, but I also enjoy the new interest courses. I just can't seem to manage my time well, and it frustrates me.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed by the clash between your schoolwork and the new courses. It sounds like you're struggling to find a balance. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you try to manage your time between both?

User: Most of the time, I just end up procrastinating on my homework because I get distracted by other things I like, like reading or folding paper. Then I stay up late trying to finish my assignments, and I end up feeling tired and guilty about not managing my time better.

Consultant: It sounds like the distractions from your interests make it difficult for you to concentrate on your homework, and that creates guilt and tiredness. Let's explore this a bit further. What do you think would help you stay focused on your studies?

User: Maybe if I had a specific plan or schedule, I could stick to it better. But whenever I sit down to do homework, I just feel the urge to do something else.

Consultant: A schedule could be a helpful tool! It might also be useful to consider how you can create a study environment that minimizes distractions. What do you think would be a good first step in setting up a schedule?

User: I think I could start by writing down what I need to do for each subject. Then, I could block time for my interest classes as well.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By delineating time for each activity, you can visualize your day better. How do you feel about setting aside specific times for both homework and your interest courses on a daily basis?

User: I like the idea of blocking time. It might make it easier to see when I can do both. But I'm still worried about keeping to the schedule. What if I can’t stick to it?

Consultant: It's natural to have concerns about sticking to a new routine. Let’s try thinking about this in a different way—what if instead of being strict with yourself, you allow for some flexibility in your schedule? How would that feel?

User: That sounds better! If I can be a bit flexible, it would probably reduce my anxiety about not finishing things. Maybe I could also reward myself with some time for my interests after completing tasks.

Consultant: I love that idea of rewarding yourself! It can create a positive reinforcement loop. How about we come up with a couple of strategies for you to implement this new schedule while still allowing some flexibility?

User: Sure! I could try working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break, where I can do something fun, like folding paper or reading.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Xiaofang! This technique, called the Pomodoro Technique, can help increase your focus and make study sessions feel more manageable. How do you feel about trying this approach for a week and then we can discuss how it worked for you?

User: I think I can manage that. I like that it gives me something to look forward to during my breaks.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! As you try this approach, pay attention to how it affects your feelings about studying. If you find that anything feels particularly challenging, we can address that in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I can definitely give this a try, and I’ll note down how I feel about it.

Consultant: Excellent! Also, let’s touch upon how you plan to handle those moments when you feel the urge to procrastinate. What can you do in those situations to help yourself get back on track?

User: Maybe when I feel like procrastinating, I could take a deep breath and remind myself of the reward waiting for me after I finish a task.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Reminding yourself of the reward can reframe your mindset. It’s important to be kind to yourself as you navigate through this process. Is there anything else that you feel could help you manage your time effectively?

User: I think if I talk to my parents about my schedule, they might be more understanding and supportive when I need to focus on my studies.

Consultant: Involving your parents can definitely provide you with additional support and accountability. They may also help encourage you when you feel stuck. Before we wrap up, how do you feel now about tackling your homework with your interest courses in mind?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. Since I have a plan and some strategies, I think I can handle things better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Keep track of your feelings and experiences throughout the week, and we can review everything during our next session. How about we meet again next week to see how everything is going?

User: Yes, that would be great! I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaofang! I’m proud of you for taking steps toward better time management. Keep being kind to yourself, and I’ll see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I’m really glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling a bit anxious again because the exams are getting closer. I'm worried about my review plan and keeping up with everything.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious with exams coming up. You've mentioned feeling a bit anxious; can you tell me more about what specifically causes you to feel that way in relation to your study plan?

User: I think it’s just the pressure of making sure I cover everything. Sometimes, I get distracted and end up not studying as much as I planned. 

Consultant: I see. So, distractions make it difficult for you to stick to your study plan. You have been working on managing procrastination, right? How has that been going for you so far?

User: Yes, I've been trying to use some of the strategies we talked about before, like setting small goals. But I still find myself deviating from my plan sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making a good effort with the strategies you've learned, but distractions are still a challenge. What small goals have you found helpful recently?

User: I set goals like studying for one subject for 30 minutes and then taking a short break. That helps a bit, but I still get sidetracked by other things around me.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! The break is important to keep you motivated. Let’s focus on how you can manage those distractions. When you find yourself getting sidetracked, what thoughts usually come into your mind?

User: I often think, “Just a quick look at my phone won’t hurt,” but then I end up scrolling for a long time. 

Consultant: That’s a common thought. It sounds like there's a bit of a struggle between wanting to study and the temptation of your phone. How do you feel when you realize that you've spent more time on your phone than planned?

User: I feel frustrated and anxious because I know I need to finish my review. It makes me think I won’t be ready for the exam.

Consultant: It’s frustrating when reality doesn’t match your expectations. Let’s explore how you could change that thought—what could you tell yourself when you notice you’re getting distracted?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I have a goal to meet and that I can have my phone during breaks instead.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective, and giving yourself permission to use your phone during breaks can help you focus better. Would you like to create a more detailed study schedule for your review to help you stay on track?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I think having a clearer plan might reduce my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s break it down. How about we start with the subjects you need to review? What subjects do you consider most important right now?

User: I think math and science are the ones I need to focus on the most because they’re harder for me.

Consultant: Got it. How many days do you have left until your exams, and how would you like to allocate time for math and science each day?

User: I have about ten days left. Maybe I can spend the first five days on math and the next five on science?

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan. How many hours would you like to dedicate to studying each subject daily?

User: I think I can do about two hours a day for each subject.

Consultant: Perfect! So if we map it out, you’d spend the first week focused on math and the second on science. How does that make you feel in terms of managing your time?

User: It feels good! I like that it gives me structure, and I don’t feel as overwhelmed thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Structure can really reduce anxiety. Remember to use those short breaks effectively based on your schedule. What do you think will help you stick to this plan?

User: I think setting a timer for my study sessions and keeping my phone in another room during that time could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Using a timer can create urgency and keeping distractions away can enable you to focus better on your studies. How do you feel about using positive self-talk when you start your study sessions?

User: I think that could really help. I’d like to remind myself that I can do it and that I have a good plan.

Consultant: Absolutely! Encouraging yourself is important. As you prepare for your exams, what are some affirmations or positive thoughts you could use?

User: I could say, “I am capable of doing well, and I have prepared for this.”

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! Remember to repeat that to yourself each day as you start studying. I believe you’ve made some great progress today. Can you summarize how you plan to approach your study routine moving forward?

User: Sure! I will follow the schedule, focusing on math for the first five days and science for the next five, using the timer and positive self-talk to keep me on track.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Xiaofang! I'm proud of how you're taking charge of your study habits. As we wrap up our session, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or clarify?

User: I think I am good for now. I just feel a bit more confident about my plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Confidence is key. Remember, if you find yourself struggling at any point, just revisit the strategies we discussed. You've got this! If you need more support, feel free to come back anytime.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Good luck with your studies, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
