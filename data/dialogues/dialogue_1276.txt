Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling even more anxious and frustrated. The rejection from that academic project really hit me hard. It's like I'm stuck and I can't see a way forward.

Consultant: I understand that the rejection has intensified your feelings of frustration and anxiety. It sounds like you're feeling quite lost right now. Let's explore that a bit more. What specific thoughts are coming up for you when you think about your academic path?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not cut out for this. I look at my classmates, and they seem to be thriving, while I feel like I’m drowning. It just makes me question my worth and whether I belong here.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of self-doubt. You're comparing yourself to others and feeling like you don’t measure up. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you think you don't belong or feel inadequate?

User: I often think things like, "I'm not smart enough," or "I'll never be successful." It’s just this heavy feeling that nothing I do will matter in the long run.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem very harsh and critical. It's important to recognize how they affect your feelings. How do these negative thoughts make you feel in terms of your mood and motivation?

User: They make me feel really hopeless. I just want to give up. I look at my studies and the future, and it all feels too overwhelming. Sometimes, I just want to escape everything.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough, Marilyn. It’s understandable to want to escape when you feel overwhelmed. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not smart enough or that you’ll never be successful?

User: Well, I guess I have done well in some subjects before... but then I think about times I've struggled, like now. It makes me focus on those failures.

Consultant: It’s common to focus on the struggles rather than the successes. Let’s reframe this a bit. If a friend were in your position and shared these thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has ups and downs and that it doesn't define their abilities. I think I’d remind them of their strengths and achievements.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective! You have the ability to see the bigger picture for others. What if you applied that same compassionate lens to yourself? Can you identify some strengths or achievements you can celebrate, no matter how small?

User: Well, I did manage to maintain good grades for the first year of my program and I organized a study group. I guess that shows I can still contribute in some way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are significant accomplishments. They reflect your capabilities and willingness to engage. How might recognizing these strengths help shift the way you see yourself in your studies?

User: Maybe it can help me to approach my studies with a bit more confidence instead of just focusing on my perceived failures.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive shift. Let’s also think about how you can build on that confidence. What small steps could you take to become more involved and regain some joy in your studies?

User: I could maybe join a club or talk to a professor about research opportunities. That might make me feel more connected and engaged.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging more could help you feel less isolated and more empowered. What other activities can you think of that might spark some interest or excitement for you?

User: I used to love reading outside of class, but I haven't done that in a while. I think I could start doing that again and allow myself to enjoy learning.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Reconnecting with the joy of learning can be very rejuvenating. How do you feel about creating a schedule that includes time for both your studies and personal interests?

User: That makes sense! It would help me to have a balanced approach and not feel so pressured all the time.

Consultant: Balance is key, and it’s great that you recognize that. As we wrap up today, let's highlight what you've committed to moving forward. What are some specific actions you'll take this week?

User: I will start by reallocating some time to enjoy reading again, and I’ll reach out to a professor about research opportunities. I’ll also remind myself of my strengths whenever those negative thoughts creep in.

Consultant: Those are solid commitments, Marilyn! It’s a step toward reframing your experience. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. Keep practicing self-compassion. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. The pressure keeps building, especially after that family gathering where everyone asked about my studies. It made me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the questions from your family have really intensified your feelings of doubt and anxiety. Can you tell me more about those feelings and what thoughts went through your mind during the gathering?

User: I just felt so embarrassed. I thought, "What if I really am not good enough?" I felt like everyone was judging me, and it made me want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds really tough to go through. Feeling judged can really heighten our insecurities. I’m curious, what specific thoughts were you having in that moment that made you feel embarrassed?

User: I kept thinking about how I dropped the ball on my studies lately and that I'm not doing as well as I should be. I felt like I was disappointing my family.

Consultant: It seems like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself regarding your academic performance and your family's expectations. What type of feelings did those thoughts lead to?

User: It just made me feel even more anxious and depressed. I’ve started questioning whether I really belong in this program or if I’m just wasting my time.

Consultant: That’s a lot to carry. When you question your place in the program, how does that affect your motivation to study or engage in your classes?

User: I find it really hard to focus. Sometimes, I just don’t even want to try anymore, which makes me feel even worse because I know I should be doing better.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle where feeling unmotivated leads to even more self-doubt. Let's take a moment to reflect on these negative thoughts. Can you recall a time when you felt more confident in your abilities?

User: There were times in my undergrad when I did well in my projects and my grades were solid. I felt proud of my work then.

Consultant: That’s a great reflection, Marilyn! When you think back to those times, what do you think contributed to your sense of confidence?

User: I think I was more engaged and my interests were aligned with my studies. Plus, I wasn’t feeling so much outside pressure.

Consultant: It seems that alignment with your interests and reduced external pressure played a significant role in your confidence. What if we could find ways to reconnect with that sense of engagement now? What might that look like?

User: I would need to set my own goals, not just what others expect of me. But I worry I won’t be able to stick to them.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Setting personal goals can be empowering. If we work together to create manageable steps, would that help relieve some of that worry about sticking to them?

User: Yes, I think it would help to have a clear plan instead of feeling lost. But what if I still mess up?

Consultant: It’s completely okay to worry about setbacks. Remember, progress includes bumps along the way. Could we focus on creating a plan with flexibility, allowing you to adjust it as needed?

User: That sounds better. I could handle that. But I also want to tackle my drinking—it's been a way to cope, but I think it's making things worse.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Managing alcohol consumption can definitely help improve your emotional well-being and stress. How do you feel about exploring strategies to reduce your drinking?

User: I think I should definitely work on it. I notice I drink more when I feel anxious or overwhelmed, especially at social events.

Consultant: That’s a crucial connection to make. It sounds like alcohol is serving as an escape. What alternatives can you envision that might help you cope with anxiety in those situations?

User: Maybe I could try talking to someone at the event instead of drinking to feel relaxed. But it still feels scary.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel scared, especially when considering changes to coping mechanisms. How about we role-play a situation where you choose to engage with someone instead of turning to alcohol? 

User: That could work. It might help me feel more prepared. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice that together. Imagine we're at a social event, and you have the option to approach someone. How do you think you'd start that conversation?

User: I could just ask them what they do or comment on the event. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! What might you feel after starting that conversation instead of drinking?

User: If I could do it, I think I’d feel proud of myself, maybe even more connected to others.

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling that sense of connection could really shift your experience at social gatherings. How do you feel about trying this out in the next social situation you attend?

User: I’m nervous, but I think I'm willing to try. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Marilyn! Remember, even small steps count towards progress. It's about growth rather than perfection. How are you feeling about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, like I have some tools to work with. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you can focus on moving forward, like setting personal goals and practicing those social interactions. 

User: That sounds good to me. I appreciate having a clearer plan! 

Consultant: I’m here for you, and I believe you have what it takes to navigate these challenges. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, reaching out for support is always a great strategy. 

User: Thank you, I will keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Today has been productive, and I'm proud of the progress you've made. Just know that you have the skills to manage your emotions and academic journey. Don't hesitate to return if you need more support. 

User: Thank you so much. I'm feeling hopeful! 

Consultant: You're welcome, Marilyn! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed. My studies aren’t going well because of my drinking, and it just makes me feel so guilty and lost. I really want to get a grip on things but it’s hard.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really challenging for you. You’re feeling this guilt and loss due to the impact of drinking on your studies. Let’s dive a bit deeper into what’s been going on with your drinking and how it ties into your feelings about your studies. Can you share more about that?

User: Well, I’ve been using alcohol as a way to cope. When I’m out with friends, I drink to feel more relaxed, but then I just end up feeling worse afterward. It’s like a cycle of short-term relief followed by long-term regret. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Marilyn. It seems like alcohol initially helps you feel at ease, but ultimately it leads to feeling worse. What thoughts go through your mind when you're drinking, especially afterward? 

User: After drinking, I usually think about how I’ve messed up again. I worry that I’m disappointing everyone and that I’ll never finish my degree. 

Consultant: Those thoughts of disappointment and doubt can be really overwhelming. Do you notice if there are specific situations or triggers that lead you to drink more?

User: Yes, I tend to drink when I’m stressed about school or when I’m feeling lonely. I think it also helps me feel more connected when I’m out socializing.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d turn to drinking in those moments, as it can feel like a quick fix for stress and loneliness. Let's challenge some of those thoughts together. What would you say to a friend who feels the same way about their drinking habits and studies?

User: I’d probably tell them to take a break and try to find healthier ways to cope, but then I don’t follow that advice myself. 

Consultant: That’s an interesting realization. It sounds like you can recognize what might help a friend but find it harder to apply the same ideas to yourself. What do you think holds you back from taking that advice?

User: I think I feel trapped in a cycle. I know I should make changes, but I just feel so low on energy and motivation. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel trapped, especially when you’re experiencing low energy and motivation. Let’s take a moment to think of small steps you could take to break that cycle. What’s one action you could try that might help you feel a little better without leading to more drinking?

User: Maybe I could start by going for a walk instead of heading out to drink on weekends. It might help clear my head.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Going for a walk can be a refreshing change of pace. How might that change in activity affect your mood or your feelings of guilt afterward?

User: I think it might help me feel like I have control over my choices, and I wouldn’t have that next-day regret.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking control of your choices can significantly improve how you feel. Let's also think about how you might handle feelings of loneliness in a different way. What are some other activities or social situations where you might feel connected without alcohol?

User: I guess I could reach out to some classmates to study together. I’m sure many of them are feeling stressed too. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Connecting with classmates in a study group can provide support and reduce loneliness without the drawbacks of drinking. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It sounds good, but I worry they might not want to spend time with me since I’ve dropped off lately.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember, many people appreciate reaching out and may be feeling just as stressed. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to spend time with you? 

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have any. It’s just a fear of mine.

Consultant: Yes, it seems like that fear is creating a barrier for you. Let’s work on reframing that thought. What could be a more balanced view of your situation? 

User: Maybe most of them would be understanding and just happy to have someone to study with.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a more balanced perspective. Challenging those fears can lead to positive experiences. What other things can we do together to prepare you for these situations where you might feel tempted to drink?

User: I could write down some coping strategies or affirmations to remind myself of healthier choices.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Writing down those strategies and reminding yourself of them can empower you. What might you include in that list?

User: I could add things like “I am in control of my choices” and “I can find joy without alcohol.” 

Consultant: Those affirmations are powerful and focused on what you can do rather than the negatives. Do you have a plan for when you might be in a triggering situation, like a party or social gathering?

User: I suppose I could tell myself to step outside and breathe if I start feeling overwhelmed or tempted to drink.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Allowing yourself to take a moment to breathe can help you recenter. As we wrap up, let’s summarize our session today. What are the main takeaways for you?

User: I need to shift my focus towards healthier activities, reach out to friends, and remind myself that I can control my choices. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognition of those choices is a significant step forward, Marilyn. It’s important to acknowledge your progress, however small it may feel. Looking ahead, how do you feel about our next meeting after you try some of these strategies?

User: I feel hopeful. I really want to make these changes. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Take your time with these changes, and remember, I’m here to support you. Keep practicing those coping strategies and remind yourself of your strengths. Looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, and what would you like to focus on today?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lost, to be honest. I tried to join that book club, but I didn’t really connect with anyone. It makes me doubt whether I can make friends at all.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling disappointed about your experience with the book club and worried about your ability to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what happened when you tried to join?

User: Well, I went to the first meeting, and everyone seemed to know each other already. I felt like an outsider. I tried to join in the conversation, but I couldn't find a good moment to speak. It just felt awkward.

Consultant: You felt out of place and like you couldn't engage in the conversation. That must have been really uncomfortable! What thoughts crossed your mind during that meeting?

User: I thought maybe I'm just not interesting enough. I ended up thinking that maybe I shouldn't even try to meet new people because it always ends up like this.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry, believing you’re not interesting enough. It seems like it led you to consider avoiding social situations altogether. What emotions did that thinking bring up for you?

User: I felt really sad and frustrated. It's like I'm stuck. I want to connect, but these negative thoughts just keep pushing me away.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stuck in that situation. Your desire to connect is strong, but those negative thoughts are holding you back. Have you noticed any other situations where similar thoughts appear?

User: Yes, actually. They come up whenever I think about networking events or meeting new people. I just get this wave of anxiety and feel like I won't fit in.

Consultant: That anxiety can be overwhelming. It seems these thoughts are telling you that you won't fit in before you even try. What evidence do you think supports that belief, and could there be other possibilities?

User: I don't know... Maybe it's just what I keep telling myself. But I've also had some times where things went okay, even if they were rare.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Marilyn. While the negative thoughts are powerful, it’s good to acknowledge that there have been moments when things went well. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them to keep trying and not give up after one bad experience. Everyone has their moments, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Your perspective is helpful. Maybe we can apply that same advice to yourself. How might you approach future social situations with that mindset?

User: Maybe I could go in expecting a mix of good and bad experiences, instead of just feeling like it's going to be awful. That could help me relax more.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Embracing both outcomes can reduce pressure on yourself. What are some small steps you could take to practice this during your next social engagement?

User: I could set a goal to speak to at least one person and not put too much pressure on myself to impress anyone.

Consultant: Setting a realistic goal sounds like a great plan! Speaking to one person is very achievable. How do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds manageable. Maybe I won't feel as anxious if I focus on a single conversation.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Remember, it’s all about practicing and building your confidence. How do you think you can prepare for your next meeting to make yourself feel more at ease?

User: I could think of a few topics in advance or even some questions to ask. That would give me something to rely on when I feel nervous!

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparing can help ease anxiety. Perhaps you could also remind yourself of your strengths during the conversation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I often forget the good things about myself when I feel anxious, so this might help me stay grounded.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your strengths can serve as a wonderful anchor during anxious moments. As we begin to wrap up, how are you feeling about the steps we've discussed today?

User: I feel more empowered. I like the idea of approaching social situations differently. I think I can really try and build connections moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you've made some great insights today. As you continue to practice these skills, what strategies can you remind yourself of to maintain this positive outlook?

User: I can remember that both good and bad experiences are part of the journey and to keep trying regardless of past setbacks.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Marilyn! You’re showing a significant shift in your mindset. As we end today's session, reflect on your progress and feel free to share any additional thoughts or feelings.

User: I just want to thank you for guiding me today. I feel more open to exploring new opportunities now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, every small step counts. If you ever need assistance again, you know I'm here to help. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you're starting to feel a bit more positive about your career. Can you share with me what sparked this change in your outlook recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I attended a career seminar, and it opened my eyes to some possibilities I hadn't considered before. For the first time, I felt a glimmer of hope for my future career.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that seminar had a significant impact on you. What specific ideas or possibilities caught your attention and made you feel hopeful?

User: The speakers discussed different roles in management that align with my skills, and it made me realize I’m more capable than I believed. I started to envision myself in a leadership position, which is a big step for me.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognized your potential and saw yourself in a leadership role. How do you feel about taking steps towards that vision? 

User: I feel a mix of excitement and fear. I’m excited because it feels like something I could really want, but I’m also scared that I might struggle or fail.

Consultant: Those feelings of both excitement and fear are completely normal, especially when considering a new direction for your career. How do you think you can manage that fear as you take steps towards your goals?

User: I guess I need to remind myself of my skills and maybe even talk to someone who can help guide me. I just don’t want to feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on your skills can help boost your confidence. Who do you think might be supportive in helping you work through this? 

User: I have a professor I trust, and I could reach out to some classmates who seem to have a clearer idea of where they're headed.

Consultant: Reaching out to those individuals could be very beneficial. It may also help you gain perspective and clarify your values regarding your career. What values are important for you in a professional environment?

User: I value collaboration, creativity, and a supportive atmosphere. I think those are crucial for me to thrive.

Consultant: Those values are essential and can definitely guide you in finding the right path. As you consider future opportunities, how can you ensure these values are prioritized in your choices? 

User: I think I need to ask questions during interviews or networking situations about team dynamics and how projects are chosen. I want to make sure the environment aligns with my values.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. Asking those questions will help you align your career choices with your core values. How do you feel about setting some specific goals related to this process? 

User: I think it would be helpful to have a few clear steps. I could start by researching companies that fit my values and then reach out for informational interviews.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Setting specific actions will help you stay focused. How many companies do you think you’d like to research and connect with in the next few weeks?

User: Maybe three to five? I think that’s manageable, and it won't overwhelm me.

Consultant: That sounds very manageable, indeed. As you work through these steps, what do you think might be some challenges you could face? 

User: I worry about putting myself out there and being rejected. Last time I tried to network, I felt disappointing when responses took too long.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have concerns about rejection. How about we discuss some strategies you can use to cope with that fear and manage your expectations throughout this process? 

User: I could remind myself that it’s a natural part of the process. Maybe I could also focus on the learning experience rather than just the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a powerful mindset shift! Viewing experiences as opportunities for growth can ease the weight of rejection. Would you like to explore more specific coping strategies for when you feel discouraged? 

User: Sure! That would be really helpful. 

Consultant: One strategy is to create a support system. Do you have friends or family who could encourage you during this journey?

User: Yes, I have a close friend who's also working on her career goals. I think we could help each other stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Having someone to share the journey with can be very uplifting. How else can you keep yourself motivated as you proceed with your goals?

User: I could set small milestones and reward myself for achieving them. That might keep things fun and reduce the pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun and effective way to stay motivated! What’s an initial milestone you’d like to set for yourself related to your research and networking?

User: I’d like to complete my research on companies by the end of next week. Then I can plan to reach out to them the following week.

Consultant: That’s a clear and achievable milestone! As you work on that, let’s also talk about how you can manage self-doubt. When those negative thoughts creep in, how can we counteract them?

User: I guess I could keep a journal of my achievements, no matter how small, to remind myself of my progress and capabilities.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Journaling can serve as a tangible reminder of your strengths. Would you like to commit to this practice over the next few weeks?

User: Yes, I think I’ll start that. It’ll be good to reflect on my growth.

Consultant: Great! I’m really proud of how far you’ve come today, Marilyn. How do you feel about our session and the steps you've outlined?

User: I feel encouraged! I have clear steps to take, and I’m excited about the direction I’m heading. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made some excellent progress. Before we end today, is there anything specific you’d like to remember as we move forward towards your goals?

User: Just to stay focused on my values and not let fear take over. I want to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: That’s a strong takeaway. Remember, it's about the journey as much as the destination. I believe you're capable of achieving your goals. If you need support, you know where to find me.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Marilyn! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Marilyn! I'm glad you're back for our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting, especially regarding your new time management techniques?

User: Hi! I feel quite encouraged, actually. I've been able to stick to my new routines, and it's surprisingly made me feel more in control. However, I still worry if this will last.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Feeling in control is a positive step forward. Let's explore that worry—what specifically makes you think it might not last?

User: Well, sometimes I get really overwhelmed with assignments, and I have this fear that I’ll fall back into my old habits of procrastination and losing interest in my studies.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with academic pressures. When you feel that way, what thoughts go through your mind about your abilities or your studies?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just not cut out for this level of study or that I’m not smart enough, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really affect your confidence. Let’s try to challenge that belief. Can you recall any evidence from your experiences that contradicts the idea of you not being capable?

User: I did well in my undergraduate studies, and I have received positive feedback from my professors. I guess part of me knows I can do it, but the negative thoughts seem to overshadow that.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize those achievements! It sounds like you have a lot of potential. What do you think would happen if you reframed those negative thoughts into something more positive or realistic?

User: Maybe instead of thinking I'm not cut out for this, I could tell myself that it's okay to struggle sometimes, but that I have succeeded before and can do so again.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a more balanced perspective. How might adopting this new mindset influence your approach to studying when you start to feel overwhelmed?

User: I guess I’d focus more on taking things step by step instead of immediately feeling defeated. I could remind myself that it's all a learning process.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive strategy. When those feelings of doubt hit, having a reminder to take it one step at a time can be grounding. Can we brainstorm together on some practical steps you could implement when you begin to feel overwhelmed?

User: Yes! I think having a checklist could help keep me on track. Also, maybe setting smaller, manageable goals for each study session would work.

Consultant: Those ideas are fantastic! A checklist can give you that sense of accomplishment with each task you complete. Do you think you might also benefit from incorporating breaks to help manage stress during those study sessions?

User: Absolutely. Sometimes I just keep going and forget to take a break, which makes it harder to focus. Maybe I could set a timer to remind me.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Timers can be very effective for maintaining focus while ensuring you take necessary breaks. Let's think about how to implement this over the next week. 

User: I’d like to try that. I can write out a study schedule and include those breaks. It feels manageable when I break it down like this.

Consultant: Excellent! Breaking things down into smaller pieces can make challenges feel less daunting. How confident do you feel about sticking to this plan?

User: I feel optimistic. I really want to make this work, especially since I've seen some positive results already. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Marilyn! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your action plan. You’ll work on a study schedule with checklists, manageable goals, and include timed breaks. Is that correct?

User: Yes, that's right! It feels good to have a clear plan.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for making these strides. Keep reflecting on your successes, and remember that it’s okay to face challenges along the way. We can always refine your approach together in future sessions.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. It really helps to talk things through.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Marilyn! As we conclude today’s session, remember the strategies we discussed. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. If you need anything in between, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: I will. Thanks again! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Take care, Marilyn! See you next time!
