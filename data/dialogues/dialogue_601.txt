Consultant: Hello, little H! I'm really glad you could come in today. I know you've been experiencing some strong feelings lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling really ignored by my classmates. They keep talking about hygiene in school, and nobody wants to be my friend anymore. I just get so angry, and sometimes I do things to get them to pay attention to me, even if it’s not good.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and lonely because of what your classmates are saying. You want to be noticed and understood. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel that way?

User: When they ignore me, I just feel really upset. I try to force them to pay attention, but then they just call me names, and it makes everything worse. I don’t know how to make them stop treating me that way.

Consultant: It must be really hard to feel like you’re not being heard, and that can make anyone angry. It seems like you’re trying to find a way to get their attention, but it might be backfiring on you. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I think they don’t like me at all. I feel alone, and then I just want to yell or hit something. I just want them to see me.

Consultant: That’s understandable, little H. It’s tough when you feel alone, and it’s natural to want to express those feelings. Have you noticed how those actions, like yelling or hitting, affect your feelings about yourself afterward?

User: Yeah, after I do something like that, I just feel more angry and sad, like I made things worse. But at that moment, it feels like I have to do something.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a cycle happening where your actions might make you feel worse in the long run. Let’s explore different ways you might express your feelings that wouldn’t lead to those negative emotions after, okay? What do you think might be a better way to express yourself?

User: I don't know... maybe if I could just talk to them instead of yelling. But what if they still don’t listen?

Consultant: That’s a great thought! Talking can be a really powerful way to express how you feel. If someone isn’t listening at first, how might you feel after you’ve tried to express yourself in a calm way?

User: I guess I would feel a little better, even if they still don’t listen. I just don’t know how to start that conversation.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel unsure about starting that conversation. Sometimes, it can help to think about what you want to say beforehand. How about we practice what you might say? What would you want them to know about your feelings?

User: Maybe I could say that I just want to be friends and that it makes me sad when they don’t talk to me? 

Consultant: That sounds like a really good start. Expressing your feelings can help others understand you better. How do you think they would respond if you said that?

User: Maybe they would think about it. But what if they still don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: It’s possible, and that can be disappointing. But remember, speaking openly about your feelings is a positive step. If they don’t respond as you hope, you can still feel proud for trying. It’s all about taking small steps toward being heard. 

User: I guess that makes sense, but it still feels scary. 

Consultant: It can be scary to reach out. Sometimes practicing with someone can ease that fear. How about we role-play this conversation? I can pretend to be one of your classmates, and you can practice what you might say.

User: Okay, I can try that! 

Consultant: Great! Whenever you're ready, just start, and I’ll respond as if I'm your classmate.

User: Um, hi... I wanted to talk to you guys. I feel sad when I’m ignored and I really want to be friends...

Consultant: Hmm, why should I talk to you? You’re always getting angry.

User: I know, and I’m sorry for that. I just feel upset when it seems like no one cares. I want to be friends and not be angry anymore.

Consultant: Okay, I can see that you’re trying. I’ll think about it.

Consultant: Fantastic! You did a really good job expressing your feelings. How did that practice feel for you?

User: It felt a little less scary when I said it like that, but I still worry they won’t want to be friends.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It takes time to build relationships, and not every attempt will lead to instant change. But practicing these conversations and expressing your feelings can gradually help shift how people respond to you. What’s one thing you could do after our session to keep working on this?

User: Maybe I could write down how I feel, so I can remember what to say when I talk to them?

Consultant: That sounds like a very helpful idea! Writing can help organize your thoughts and make you feel more prepared. How did you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel a bit better, but I still have a long way to go.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel that way. Change takes time, and you’re already taking steps in the right direction. Remember, I’m here to support you, and we can continue to work together on this.

User: Thanks. I really appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of the effort you’re making. Let’s keep working together, and remember, expressing your feelings and practicing those conversations are key parts of this journey. 

User: I will try to remember that. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset. I look forward to our next session, where we can talk more about your progress. Take care, little H!

User: Bye! Thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello H! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling isolated and distressed due to some conflicts with your classmates. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel really upset because my classmates don’t want to play with me. I got into a fight during an after-school activity, and it made me feel hurt and lonely. I just want them to accept me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, H. It’s understandable to feel hurt when you want to belong, but you feel rejected instead. What do you think would help you connect better with your classmates?

User: I don’t know... Sometimes I feel like if I show them I'm tough, they might respect me more. But it doesn't seem to work. Maybe I need to be more friendly, but I'm not sure how.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re willing to try being more friendly. Let’s explore that idea. When you think about being friendly, what are some actions you could take to show that you want to connect with others?

User: Maybe I could ask them to play games with me or share my stuff with them? But what if they still don't want to?

Consultant: Asking to play games and sharing can be a good start! It's normal to feel scared that they might still say no. How about we role-play a situation where you invite a classmate to join you in a game? This way, you can practice being friendly.

User: That sounds okay, but what if I'm too nervous to actually do it in real life?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, H. We can work through that together. Let's first practice what you could say if you were inviting a classmate to play. What would your invitation look like?

User: Um... maybe I could say, “Hey, do you want to play football with me at recess?” But I worry they won't respond well.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Remember, you won’t know the response until you try. What if we framed it in a way that acknowledges their feelings too? You might say, “I’d really like some company to play football. If you're up for it, let’s play together!” How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds nicer. I just feel like I keep messing things up and it makes me frustrated.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel frustrated. Change takes time, and making mistakes is part of the learning process. What’s one small step you could take this week to practice being friendly?

User: I think I could try saying hi to someone I usually don’t talk to. I could at least do that.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Saying hi is a simple yet effective way to open up. How do you think you would feel after trying that?

User: I might feel a bit better if it goes well. But I still worry about how it might go wrong.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to have those worries. Remember that even if it doesn’t go perfectly, you are trying, and that’s what matters. What could you remind yourself if things don’t work out as you hoped?

User: Maybe I could tell myself it’s just a step and not the end. I should keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! Each small step is part of your journey. How do you feel about the support you get from your family regarding your feelings?

User: Well, I mostly talk to my grandparents. They care, but I feel like they don’t really understand what I’m going through at school.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Sometimes, it helps to share your experiences with those close to you, even if they don't totally understand. Would it be helpful to discuss your feelings with them more?

User: I guess I could try talking to my grandpa about it. He usually listens.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea! Having someone to talk to can really make a difference. How do you think he might respond when you share how you’re feeling?

User: I think he would try to help. He always tells me if I’m frustrated, I should talk about it.

Consultant: That’s great support! Expressing your feelings can often lighten the burden. Now, let’s also think about the importance of patience in this process. How will you remind yourself that change takes time?

User: I could keep a small note with me. Maybe something like “Every step counts” or “Be patient with yourself.”

Consultant: I love that idea! Having reminders can foster your motivation. Do you have a small notebook or something where you can jot that down?

User: I do have a little notebook! I can use that.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a wonderful tool to keep you focused on your progress. As we wrap up today, can you share one thing you feel more hopeful about after our session?

User: I feel a bit better about trying to be friendly, even if it’s a bit scary. I’ll try to talk to my classmates and my grandpa.

Consultant: That’s a big step, H! I'm really proud of your willingness to grow and seek connection. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. You can always reach out if you need help along the way.
###################
Consultant: Hello, H! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you've been working on improving your personal hygiene habits. Can you share with me how that has been going for you?

User: Hi. It's been tough. I really want to do better at keeping clean, but I feel like no one notices or encourages me, and it makes me doubt if I can really change.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds frustrating to put in the effort and not receive any feedback or support. Let’s talk about what improvements you've noticed in your hygiene habits, even if they feel small. What changes have you been able to make so far?

User: Well, I’ve been brushing my teeth more regularly and taking showers every day. But then I think, "Does it even matter if no one says anything?"

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve started brushing your teeth and showering more often! Those are significant steps. Your feelings of doubt are valid, especially when you aren’t receiving encouragement. How would you feel if we found some ways to celebrate these improvements, even if it’s just for yourself?

User: I guess it could help, but it just feels like it’s not enough. I want someone to really notice I’m trying.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's completely normal to want recognition for your efforts, especially when you’re trying to change. How about we create some small goals you can achieve and recognize on your own? That way, you can feel proud of what you're accomplishing, even without outside recognition.

User: That sounds okay. But I'm not sure I can stick to small goals. I feel like I just give up if it gets too hard.

Consultant: I understand that concern. It's important to set achievable goals that won't feel overwhelming. What if we started with a very small goal, something you feel confident you could do each day? We could then note those successes together. Would that feel more manageable?

User: Maybe. What kind of small goal could I set?

Consultant: How about aiming to brush your teeth at the same time each day? It sounds simple, but consistency can really make a difference. Once you achieve that, we can add on more small goals. How does that sound to you?

User: That might work, I can try that. But what if I forget or just don’t want to?

Consultant: It's okay to forget sometimes! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. If you miss a day, you can remind yourself that it's a journey, and you can always start fresh the next day. Would setting a reminder on your phone help?

User: I think that could help a little. Maybe I can also ask my grandpa to remind me too?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having someone to support you is very helpful. Can you share how you'd feel if your grandpa reminded you to brush your teeth?

User: I think it would feel nice. I wouldn’t feel so alone trying to remember.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like having that support could help you feel more motivated. Let’s also explore how you might feel when you achieve these small goals. Can you picture a moment when you complete one of your hygiene goals and acknowledge it in a positive way?

User: Yeah, I guess I could feel proud of myself! But what if I still feel like I’m not doing enough?

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that feeling. It’s important to remember that every small step counts. Progress takes time, and by celebrating each little win, you're cultivating a proud sense of accomplishment. What do you think you could say to yourself when you complete a goal?

User: I could tell myself I'm doing better. I like the idea of celebrating my success, even if it’s small.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset, H. Positive self-talk can be very encouraging. As you continue this journey, what other small actions do you think you could take to maintain your progress?

User: Maybe I could also keep my room cleaner. I want my space to feel just as good as I do.

Consultant: That sounds like another excellent goal! Keeping your space clean can definitely contribute to how you feel about your hygiene. What’s one simple way you could start with that?

User: I could start by making my bed every morning. I think that’s doable.

Consultant: Making your bed is a fantastic start! How about we set a plan together: you aim to make your bed every morning and brush your teeth consistently. We can check back on how these goals are going in our next session. How does that sound?

User: I like that plan! I think I can manage both of those.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you, H! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps at your own pace. As we work together, we’ll focus on gradually building your confidence and skills. You are capable of making these changes.

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful now. I really want to work through this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! As you embrace these changes, just remember that it’s okay to feel uncertain at times. It’s all part of the learning process. Keep believing in yourself, and we will continue to build on this foundation together. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, little H! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you have some feelings about joining that new extracurricular group. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?

User: Hi! So, I really wanted to join the group, but I feel confused about what we do there. It's hard for me to make friends, and I don’t know how to fit in.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Feeling confused can make it hard to engage with new experiences. What specific activities in the group are you feeling uncertain about?

User: I think it’s all the games and stuff. Everyone seems to know each other, and I feel like I’m the only one who doesn't belong.

Consultant: Feeling like an outsider can be really challenging, especially when everyone else seems to have connections. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining those games?

User: I think they might not want me to play. I keep imagining them laughing at me if I mess up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel worried about how others might perceive you. Those thoughts can really amplify your anxiety. What emotions do you notice when those thoughts come up?

User: I feel really sad and sometimes a little angry. It makes me want to just stay away instead of trying.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel sad and frustrated in situations like that. Let’s explore those feelings—when you think about joining the group and those thoughts come up, do you think there's a way to challenge and change them?

User: I guess I could think they might actually be nice and just want to have fun, but it’s hard.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Trying to see the situation from a different perspective can help. What if you approached one of them and asked about the games? How might that change the way you feel?

User: That might help. If I ask, maybe they would include me. But what if they ignore me?

Consultant: It’s normal to fear rejection, but not every interaction will lead to that. What evidence do you have that they would ignore you? Have you seen them include others who were new?

User: Well, I’ve seen them include some new kids before. But I worry I’ll just freeze and not know what to say.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let’s practice a few simple ways to start a conversation. How about we role-play a scenario? I can pretend to be one of the kids in the group. 

User: Okay, that sounds fun!

Consultant: Great! Let’s say we’re both waiting for the game to start. You can approach me and introduce yourself. What do you think you might say?

User: I could say, “Hi, I’m H. What game are we playing?”

Consultant: Excellent start! Now, imagine I respond positively. How would you feel after saying that?

User: I’d probably feel a little better, like I actually spoke up.

Consultant: Exactly! Speaking up is a big step, and feeling that slight relief can encourage more interactions. How would you keep that positive feeling after the conversation?

User: I think I should remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. And if they are nice, maybe I can talk to them more next time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself about the positive interaction can help solidify that openness. Would you be open to trying this approach at your next group meeting?

User: Yes! I’d like to try this!

Consultant: Fantastic! Before we finish today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned so far. What strategies will you take with you as you move forward?

User: I’ll remember to challenge my thoughts and practice starting conversations. And I’ll think about how it feels to be included.

Consultant: Wonderful! Focusing on these strategies can really help you feel more confident. It’s been great exploring this with you today, H. Remember to be kind to yourself as you try these new strategies. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel good! I’m excited to try talking to the other kids.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Just remember, every little step counts in building those connections. See you next time!

User: Bye! Thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little H! I'm glad to see you today. I heard that you had a positive experience during the recent school group activity. How did that make you feel?

User: Hi! Yes, it was really nice. I felt included and happy to be part of the group. It was fun to work with others, and I didn't feel so alone.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you enjoyed being part of a team. Can you tell me more about what you liked most about that experience?

User: I liked that everyone was working together and cheering each other on. It felt good to be supported, and I realized I can enjoy being around others instead of being by myself all the time.

Consultant: It's amazing that you felt supported and that being with others was enjoyable for you. How do you think you can keep finding those kinds of experiences in the future?

User: I think I could join more school activities or clubs. Maybe I could also invite some classmates to hang out after school.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Joining clubs and inviting classmates can really help you create and maintain connections. What kind of activities or clubs are you interested in?

User: I like sports, especially basketball, so maybe I could join the basketball team or something like that. 

Consultant: The basketball team sounds like a fantastic choice! Being part of a sports team can also build strong friendships. How do you feel about reaching out to your classmates to join you in these activities?

User: I think I would feel a bit nervous asking, but I want to try. I want to have more friends and not feel so alone.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about reaching out to others. What if we talked about some ways to approach your classmates? It could help boost your confidence.

User: That could be helpful. I just don’t want to be rejected or make it awkward.

Consultant: Rejection can feel tough, but remember that everyone appreciates a friendly invitation. If a classmate declines, it’s not a reflection on you. How about practicing a simple way to invite them?

User: Okay, I could just say, "Hey, do you want to play basketball after school?" That seems simple.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It's direct and friendly. Just try to remember that even if they aren’t available, you’ve taken a great step by reaching out. How would inviting someone make you feel afterward?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself. Just trying would mean I'm making an effort, you know?

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step is something to be proud of. Now, let’s think about what other positive things you might experience being involved in these activities.

User: If I join the team, I could make new friends and maybe even get better at basketball too.

Consultant: That's a fantastic perspective! Improving your skills and making friends can enhance your confidence even more. Let’s explore what steps you can take to stay motivated along this journey.

User: I could set little goals for myself, like going to practice regularly and talking to at least one person each time.

Consultant: Setting goals is an excellent strategy! Those little goals will help you build connections gradually. How will you keep track of your progress?

User: Maybe I can write it down in a notebook or something. I could keep a record of who I've talked to and how I felt.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Keeping a record can help you reflect on your journey and recognize your achievements. How do you think you would feel if you see improvements written down?

User: I think it would make me really happy! I would see that I'm actually making friends and getting better at basketball!

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those improvements is important. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize what you've learned and how you can continue growing.

User: Okay! I learned to take little steps, like inviting friends and joining activities. I can track my progress, and I’m excited about making new friends!

Consultant: You've done an amazing job identifying your goals and the steps to achieve them. Remember, I’m here to support you, and you’ve got this! If you ever need to talk, just let me know. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now. I will definitely try to reach out and participate more.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little H! I’m glad to hear that. Enjoy your new adventures, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao H! I'm really glad to see you again today. It seems that you've made progress since our last session. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good. I've been trying to change my behavior, and I think it’s starting to work. Some classmates are starting to recognize me as one of them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Gaining recognition from your classmates must feel really rewarding. Can you tell me more about the changes you’ve made and how they have impacted your relationships at school?

User: I’ve been trying to be less aggressive and more friendly. I even helped a classmate with homework last week, and they seemed to appreciate it.

Consultant: That's a fantastic step forward, Xiao H! Helping others is a great way to build friendships. How did it feel for you to help your classmate? 

User: It felt nice. I was nervous at first, but when they thanked me, it made me feel proud of myself.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you felt proud. This indicates a positive shift in how you view yourself. Have there been any specific thoughts or feelings that came up during this experience?

User: I felt anxious while helping at first, like what if I messed up? But then I thought, "I can do this!" 

Consultant: That’s a very encouraging thought! It sounds like you were able to challenge your initial anxiety, which is an important skill. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts when you're in social situations?

User: I usually think that people won't like me or that I'll mess up, but now I'm trying to focus more on the positive things.

Consultant: That’s a great approach, focusing on the positives can make a huge difference. It seems like you are recognizing those negative thoughts and trying to replace them with more constructive ones. Can you remember a specific situation where you applied this new way of thinking?

User: Yes! During recess, I was worried nobody would play with me. Instead, I thought about how I could join in, and I asked some classmates to play soccer. 

Consultant: That sounds like a brave step, Xiao H! Taking initiative like that shows your growing confidence. What did you feel afterward when you joined them?

User: I felt really happy! I was nervous at first, but then it was fun playing with them.

Consultant: Happiness after taking a risk is a wonderful reward! Let's reflect a bit more on this progress. What do you think you have learned about yourself during these changes?

User: I think I’m more capable than I believed before. I can make friends if I just try.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Recognizing your capabilities is key to building confidence. As you think about your future interactions at school, what goals would you like to set for yourself?

User: I want to keep making more friends. Maybe I could try joining a club or something.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! It can provide opportunities to meet new people and engage in activities you enjoy. What specific club interests you?

User: I like sports, so maybe the soccer club. I think I could make friends there.

Consultant: The soccer club sounds perfect for you! Engaging in an activity you enjoy will help you connect with others who share similar interests. As you look forward to this new goal, what strategies can you think of to support yourself in this journey?

User: I could practice talking to new people more, maybe start with my classmates while playing.

Consultant: Practicing those conversations is a great strategy! It’s also important to remind yourself of your progress every step of the way. If you ever feel uncertain, what positive thought could you use to encourage yourself?

User: I could remind myself that I helped someone and they liked it. That means I can do this!

Consultant: Absolutely, keeping that positive feedback in mind can really help. It’s about building on those small victories. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize your achievements and set some intentions for the changes you want to continue pursuing.

User: I’ve become friendlier and more open. I want to keep this up and try joining the soccer club soon.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful summary, Xiao H! You’ve demonstrated great personal growth and a willingness to change. Hold onto that optimism and remember, you're capable of achieving your goals. If challenges arise, recall how far you've come.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about my goals now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You have all the tools you need to succeed. Just remember, I'm here if you ever want to chat again. You’ve done great work, and I believe in your continued success!
