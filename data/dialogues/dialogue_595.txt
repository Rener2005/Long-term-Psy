Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. I find myself often sitting alone in a corner, not wanting to talk to anyone. The conflicts with my mother seem to be getting worse, and it’s weighing heavily on me.

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It sounds like the situation with your mother is particularly challenging. Can you share what specifically has been going on between you two lately?

User: Well, she often criticizes me and expresses her worries about my future. I just feel so trapped in my current situation and her comments make me feel even worse.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling trapped and criticized can create a lot of emotional strain. You mentioned feeling down; what thoughts come to your mind when you think about these conflicts with your mother?

User: I think she doesn't understand me at all. It feels like my efforts to improve my life aren’t acknowledged. Instead, I get more pressure from her, which makes me want to isolate myself even more.

Consultant: It seems like you feel a lack of understanding and support from her, which is making you retreat even further. Let's explore these thoughts a bit more. When you think your efforts aren’t acknowledged, how does that make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel worthless. It makes me doubt whether I will ever really change. I just wish she could see my struggles and be more supportive.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way when you’re under pressure, especially from someone you love. Let’s consider this for a moment: what would it look like for you if your mother were more supportive? How would that change your outlook?

User: I guess I would feel more motivated. If she recognized my efforts, maybe I wouldn’t feel so alone in this. It could really help me cope with everything.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. Feeling recognized can indeed enhance motivation. Have there been moments in the past when she has supported you or understood your struggles?

User: There were a few times, but they feel so far away now. Most of the time it just feels like she doesn’t see how hard things are for me.

Consultant: Acknowledging those few moments can remind you that support is possible. Can we try to identify some of the specific beliefs you hold about these interactions? What do you think is going on in your mind when she criticizes you?

User: I think I always assume she’s saying those things because I’m not good enough. It's as if I'm already failing in her eyes and nothing I do will change that.

Consultant: That sounds like a very heavy belief to carry. Let's challenge that thought. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re not good enough? 

User: I guess there are times when I manage things well, but when I’m feeling down, I just can’t see them clearly. 

Consultant: It's common to lose sight of our accomplishments when we’re feeling low. How might you remind yourself of those moments when you feel that way, especially during interactions with your mother? 

User: I could try to write them down or recall them before talking to her. But I’m not sure it would really change her attitude.

Consultant: It might not change her attitude, but it could change how you perceive the interactions. Having this list could shift your focus from feeling criticized to recalling your strengths. How does that idea make you feel?

User: It feels a bit empowering, actually. I like the idea of reminding myself of my strengths before conversations. 

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Empowering yourself can help reduce the emotional burden in those critical moments. We can also work on practicing those conversations. Would you like to role-play a scenario where you express your feelings to your mother?

User: Yes, that could be helpful. I haven’t really expressed how much her comments affect me.

Consultant: Let’s start with how you might open the conversation. You could say something like, “Mom, I want to talk about something that’s been bothering me. I often feel upset when you…” How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds okay. I can see how starting with my feelings might open up a discussion rather than starting with blame.

Consultant: Exactly! Starting with your feelings can evoke empathy and reduce defensiveness. How do you think she might respond to you sharing your feelings this way?

User: I hope she listens, but I fear she might still dismiss me.

Consultant: It’s okay to have that fear, but remember, you’re aiming to express yourself clearly. If she dismisses you, you can still reinforce your feelings. How would it feel to confidently express your truth, regardless of her reaction?

User: I think it would feel liberating to be true to myself. Even if she doesn’t react well, at least I’ve said my part.

Consultant: That’s a strong perspective, Xiaohua. Owning your feelings and assertively expressing them can lead to healthier interactions in the long run. What other steps do you think you could take to enhance your communication with her?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say before the actual conversation. And I can also remind myself that it’s okay not to have her approval.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Practicing can help you feel more prepared, and accepting that her approval isn’t everything can relieve some pressure. What do you think your next steps will be after today's session?

User: I’ll work on writing down my feelings and practicing them before I talk to her. I want to keep reminding myself of my strengths too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Remember, it takes time and practice, but every effort you make counts. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I know it won’t be easy, but I feel more prepared to express myself now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Understanding your feelings and developing strategies can really empower you. Let's check in next time about how it goes with your mother. You’ve made some valuable progress today. 

User: Thank you for your support. I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohua! I’m here for you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! It's great to see you again. I know we've been working on improving your communication, especially with your mother. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling a bit disappointed. I tried to have a deeper conversation with my mother, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped. I’m starting to doubt my ability to communicate effectively.

Consultant: I understand that must feel frustrating. It's tough when we invest in a conversation and it doesn't go as planned. Can you tell me more about that conversation? What specifically felt disappointing for you?

User: I thought we could have a meaningful discussion, but it just ended up being superficial. I couldn't express what I really wanted to say, and I felt like she wasn't listening.

Consultant: That sounds really discouraging. It's hard when we feel unheard. Let's take a moment to identify what you were hoping to communicate. What was your main goal in that conversation?

User: I wanted to explain how I feel and maybe find a way for us to connect better. But instead, I just ended up feeling more distant.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd want to connect and share your feelings. When you say you felt more distant, what thoughts went through your mind during that moment?

User: I thought maybe I'm not good at this. I saw my mother looking uninterested, and it made me feel like my feelings don’t matter.

Consultant: That sounds very painful. It sounds like you were interpreting her expression as disinterest, which led to those negative thoughts about yourself. How do you feel about challenging that thought—maybe looking for other explanations for her reaction?

User: I guess it's possible she was just tired or preoccupied. But it’s hard not to take it personally.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. It's natural to internalize other people's reactions. Let’s think about alternative interpretations together. How could her being tired or preoccupied change how you view the conversation?

User: If I consider that, maybe it’s not entirely about me. She could be going through her own issues that affected her listening.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that can help take some pressure off you. Instead of viewing it as a failure on your part, you can see it as a moment that wasn’t ideal for both of you. How does that shift make you feel?

User: I feel a bit relieved actually. Maybe I can try again another time when she's more available.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Now, let’s talk about practical strategies for when you do have those conversations with her. What kind of specific strategies do you think might improve your communication next time?

User: Maybe I could plan what I want to say in advance so I don't forget important points.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Planning can give you clarity. Aside from planning, perhaps we could practice some role-playing today. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I think that could help. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s set up a scenario where you want to express your feelings to your mother. You can start with what you’d like to say, and I’ll respond as if I were her. 

User: Alright. I’d say something like, “Mom, I’ve been feeling a bit lonely and I really want us to connect better.” 

Consultant: I respond, “I’m busy right now. Can’t this wait?” How does that make you feel in this scenario?

User: It makes me feel like giving up, but I know I shouldn't.

Consultant: That’s a common response. Remember, it’s okay to feel that way. Instead, how could you respond to keep the conversation going? 

User: I could say, “I understand you’re busy, but it’s important to me. Can we talk later?” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent response! You’re asserting your needs while being respectful of her situation. How confident do you feel after practicing that?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. It feels good to know I can express my need.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Confidence often grows from practice. As we work together, what are some additional goals you have in mind for our sessions moving forward?

User: I want to really develop my confidence in public situations, not just with my mother.

Consultant: That’s a great aspiration! Building confidence in public settings can be very empowering. We can work on techniques that enhance your communication skills across different contexts. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good! I think that will help me in other areas of my life.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll focus on practical strategies that you can apply in various situations. As we wrap up today, what do you think would be the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think practicing my responses and understanding that others might have their own issues will help me not take things too personally.

Consultant: That’s an insightful takeaway! Remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these conversations. I believe you’re making great strides! If you find yourself needing support, feel free to reach out between sessions.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohua! It’s been wonderful working with you today. I look forward to seeing your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! It’s great to see you again. I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling since our last session. Can you share your thoughts with me?

User: Hi. I’ve been reflecting on what we talked about. I still feel a bit unsure about sharing in public, especially after that group activity. I wanted to share my story but got too nervous and couldn't do it.

Consultant: I understand that feeling nervous can be discouraging, especially when you want to share your experiences. Can we explore together what specifically made you feel nervous during that group activity?

User: I think it was the fear of being judged by others. I felt like everyone was watching me and waiting for me to say something meaningful, and I just froze up.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s common to worry about judgment in those situations. When you felt frozen, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking, “What if they don’t care about what I have to say? What if I embarrass myself?” Those thoughts really held me back.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It’s understandable that they would make it difficult to share your story. How do you feel those thoughts impacted your ability to speak?

User: They made me feel small and unimportant. I felt like I had nothing to contribute, which made me want to just disappear.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s hard to put yourself out there when you feel that way. What would it mean for you to challenge those thoughts and perhaps view the situation differently?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their own stories and that sharing mine might actually resonate with someone else. But it's easier said than done.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective! Thinking about how your experiences can connect with others is a great way to challenge those limiting beliefs. Would you like to try practicing some strategies to build your confidence when sharing in public?

User: Yes, I would like that. But I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: How about we start with some smaller, low-pressure scenarios? For instance, sharing something brief with a friend or someone you feel comfortable with? How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I can try that. 

Consultant: Great! We can also work on preparing a few sentences about your story that you could practice. What key points do you think you'd want to share with your friend?

User: I would probably start with how I ended up at the rehabilitation center and what I've learned about myself. 

Consultant: That’s a meaningful beginning. It allows you to talk about your journey while giving insight into who you are. How might you feel about sharing that with a friend?

User: I think it would feel good, but I still worry about their reaction.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It might help to remind yourself that a supportive friend is likely to be empathetic. Would you like to brainstorm some responses you could use based on how a friend might react?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel prepared.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s consider positive responses they might give, such as "Thank you for sharing" or "I appreciate your openness." By imagining these supportive reactions, you might feel more at ease. 

User: I can see how thinking about positive support could help. It feels less scary that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing those thoughts can gradually reduce your anxiety. Would you be interested in setting a small goal for yourself this week, perhaps to practice sharing your story with your friend?

User: Yes, I would like to set that goal! Maybe I can try to share my story by the end of the week.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember to be kind to yourself in the process. How do you feel about checking in during our next session to discuss the experience after you share?

User: I feel good about that. I’ll try to keep a positive mindset.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a step forward. As we wrap up today’s session, can you reflect on what you’ve learned today about sharing your story?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel nervous, and I can use strategies to help manage those feelings. Thinking about the reactions I might get also makes it less intimidating.

Consultant: Well said, Xiaohua. It sounds like you are building a stronger foundation for expressing yourself. Keep practicing, and I believe you’ll continue to make progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, small steps can lead to significant changes. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience next time. 

User: Me too! See you next time.

Consultant: Take care, Xiaohua! See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, particularly about your interactions with strangers?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I managed to greet a few new people at the activity center, which felt nice. But I still find it hard to keep the conversations going.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Xiaohua! It’s great to hear that you started greeting new people. Let’s explore this a bit more—what thoughts come to mind when you're trying to continue those conversations?

User: I guess I worry that I might run out of things to say or that they won’t be interested in talking to me. It makes me nervous.

Consultant: Those feelings are understandable. It sounds like there's a fear of not being engaging enough. Can you recall a specific interaction where you felt that anxiety, and what thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, there was a moment when I spoke to someone about our favorite hobbies. I thought, “What if I say something boring?” I ended up just nodding instead of sharing my interests.

Consultant: That thought of saying something boring can create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge that idea together. What evidence do you have that what you say might be boring to others? 

User: I don't have any evidence, really; it’s just how I feel. But I do enjoy talking about my hobbies when I'm with close friends.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It seems you can enjoy sharing when you're in a comfortable environment. How about we work on finding ways to build that comfort in new conversations? What if you focused on asking questions about their hobbies too?

User: That's a good idea! I think I can do that. It would take some of the pressure off me to talk all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! By asking questions, you can create a more balanced conversation. Are there specific questions you could practice asking that feel comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could ask something like, "What hobbies do you enjoy?" That seems straightforward enough.

Consultant: That's a perfect start! It’s simple and inviting. Let’s imagine you’re in a social situation again. How do you think you can introduce that question to keep the conversation flowing?

User: I could start with a greeting, mention my own hobby and then ask them about theirs. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Great! That approach allows for a natural exchange. How do you feel about practicing that in a safe space? Perhaps I could pretend to be someone at the activity center, and we can role-play the conversation.

User: I like that idea! It would help me to practice and get more comfortable.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's start the role-play. I’m someone you just met at the center. You can begin the conversation whenever you're ready.

User: Hi there! I’m Xiaohua. I like drawing and painting. What hobbies do you enjoy?

Consultant: Hi, Xiaohua! It’s nice to meet you. I enjoy playing guitar in my free time. What kind of art do you like to create?

User: I mostly like to paint landscapes. It helps me relax. Do you play any specific type of music?

Consultant: That sounds lovely! I play mostly folk music. Painting sounds like a great way to express yourself. How often do you get a chance to paint?

User: I paint whenever I feel up for it, but it’s not as often as I’d like. Sometimes, I feel too anxious to start.

Consultant: I see. It can be tough to start sometimes, even with activities we enjoy. What do you think could help motivate you to pick up the brush again?

User: Maybe if I invite someone to paint with me, it would help. I wouldn’t feel alone, and we could share ideas.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Inviting someone alongside you could create a supportive atmosphere. How do you feel about taking that step after our session?

User: I feel optimistic! I should have more courage to reach out to others, especially about something I love.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaohua. I'm really proud of you for feeling optimistic about reaching out. Now, let’s talk about any concerns you might have about this approach.

User: I worry about being rejected if they don’t want to join me. It makes me hesitant.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but remember, not everyone may respond the same way. What if you replace that thought with a different perspective? What might be a more realistic way to think about reaching out?

User: I could think that they might be interested, or even if they say no, it’s not personal. There are many people who might want to join in.

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing that thought can help reduce the fear of rejection. You are building a supportive network, and taking that step can lead to positive experiences. 

User: I feel more confident thinking that way. I’m really motivated to try out these ideas.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’re making great progress. As you move forward, remember to celebrate even the small victories in your social interactions. How are you feeling about our session today and your goals?

User: I feel empowered! Today's role-play was so helpful, and I have a clearer idea of how to approach conversations. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're ready to embrace more social opportunities. Let’s wrap up by summarizing what you’ve learned today and strategies you plan to implement.

User: I learned to ask questions, focus on balancing the conversation, and consider inviting someone to share painting time with me. I’ll keep working on my mindset about social interactions too.

Consultant: You’ve summarized it beautifully! I believe these steps will truly enhance your interactions. Remember, you are not alone in this process, and support is always around. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much! I already feel better and more hopeful about my social engagements.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohua! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohua! I'm glad you're here today. It's great to hear that you've been feeling the positive effects of group support. How are things going for you since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I feel a lot better, actually. Participating in the activities at the rehabilitation center has made me realize how much I enjoy being with others. I want to try joining more activities to connect with people.

Consultant: That sounds really encouraging! It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling connected. What types of activities are you considering participating in next?

User: I was thinking about joining a group art class or maybe a hiking trip. I feel like getting into these activities could help me meet more people.

Consultant: Those both sound like fantastic options! Engaging in a creative class or outdoor activity can be a great way to socialize. How do you feel about taking the first step towards joining one of these groups?

User: I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. What if I don’t fit in or feel overwhelmed?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about stepping out of your comfort zone. Let's explore that thought—what evidence do you have that you might not fit in? Have you had any positive experiences in group settings recently?

User: Well, during the last group outing, I actually found myself enjoying the conversations with others. I guess I was just worried about being rejected again, like I felt in my old job.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears based on past experiences. However, it seems you’ve already had a glimpse of connection during your recent outing. How might that experience help you feel more confident about trying again?

User: I suppose I can remind myself of that positive experience. Maybe I just need to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking it step by step can help ease the anxiety. Perhaps you could set a small goal for your first class, like just meeting a few people and enjoying the activity without pressuring yourself to make lasting connections right away.

User: That sounds doable. I could focus on enjoying the painting instead of worrying about how I come across to others.

Consultant: Great approach! Focusing on the activity can help you engage more naturally with others. After you attend, it might be helpful to reflect on how it went. What do you think you could share with yourself about the experience afterward?

User: I think I could write down what I enjoyed about the class and how I felt while interacting with others. That would help me remember the positive aspects.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Keeping a journal of your experiences can reinforce those positive feelings and help you notice patterns in your social interactions. How has writing or reflecting in the past helped you manage your feelings?

User: I’ve never really done that seriously, but I think it would be beneficial. I sometimes have trouble remembering good feelings after difficult days.

Consultant: Reflecting on positive experiences is a powerful tool. It can help you create a strong contrast to any challenging moments. Would you be open to committing to this practice after each activity you attend?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels like a useful strategy.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let's talk about how you'd like to maintain your relationship with your mother, now that she’s there supporting you. How do you feel about that?

User: I appreciate her being here, but sometimes it feels a bit suffocating, especially as I try to create my own space with new friends.

Consultant: Balancing your personal space with family support can indeed be challenging. How can you communicate your needs to her while also appreciating her presence?

User: Maybe I could set aside specific times for myself and let her know my schedule. That way, she would understand when I need that space.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive and respectful way to establish boundaries. Clear communication can help both of you understand each other's needs better. How do you feel about having that conversation with her?

User: A little anxious, but I think it’s important. I want her to know I value her support but also need my independence.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset. It shows growth and understanding of your own needs. It might help to practice what you want to say before the conversation. Would you like to role-play a bit?

User: That would be helpful! I can see how that might give me more confidence to speak with her.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's say your mother is asking about spending time together. You might start by acknowledging her care and then express your need for some alone time. Want to give it a try?

User: Okay. "Mom, I really appreciate you being here for me, but I've also started to enjoy my time connecting with others. I would like to have some alone time to recharge."

Consultant: Well done! You’ve communicated your feelings clearly and respectfully. How does it feel to express it that way?

User: It feels empowering! I think this approach can help both of us.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, maintaining these connections and your personal space is important for your overall well-being. Looking back on our session today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it’s that I can be proactive in establishing relationships and boundaries. Plus, the idea of reflecting on my experiences is something I really want to incorporate.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Recognizing your agency in building connections and expressing your needs is a significant step forward. I look forward to hearing about how these changes impact your social life in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared to tackle these challenges now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaohua! I'm excited for you and your journey ahead. Remember, I'm here to support you anytime. Let’s meet again soon to discuss your progress!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Hua! I'm really glad to see you today. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hello! I feel much better now, especially in my relationship with my mother. We’ve been having more conversations, and she supports my participation in activities. It feels nice to have that encouragement.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your relationship with your mother is improving, and her support is really valuable. Can you share what activities you've been participating in and how they made you feel?

User: I attended a community event last weekend. It was a bit intimidating at first, but I managed to talk with a few people, which felt really good. I was worried about my social skills, but it seems like I handled it okay.

Consultant: That's a significant step, Xiao Hua! Engaging in a community event requires courage, especially given your concerns about social skills. What thoughts were going through your mind during the event? Did any particular feelings arise?

User: I felt nervous initially, thinking nobody would want to talk to me. But after I started chatting, the nerves faded away. I felt more confident as the conversations went on.

Consultant: It’s great to see that shift from nervousness to confidence. It sounds like you were able to manage those initial thoughts of anxiety. How do you think this experience can help you in future social situations?

User: I realize that my worries often make me overthink things. If I push through the initial discomfort, I can enjoy the situation. I want to remember that for next time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that push through can lead to enjoyment is a key insight. Do you have any specific strategies in mind that you can use to remind yourself of this when facing similar situations?

User: I think I’ll make a list of positive affirmations to read before events. I could also remind myself of the good feelings I had at the community event to motivate me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Positive affirmations can serve as a great reminder of your strengths and capabilities. Have you used any affirmations before, or is this a new approach for you?

User: I’ve never really used them before. It seems a bit silly, but I’m willing to try anything that might help!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way about trying something new, but it can be empowering. We often underestimate the impact of our self-talk. How do you think you might feel using affirmations before future events?

User: I hope it helps me feel more calm and prepared. I’m excited to give it a try!

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Let’s talk about any challenges you might anticipate in your social interactions. What do you think could potentially come up that might make you feel uneasy?

User: I worry about facing rejection or just not fitting in. Those thoughts can creep in if I feel too shy again.

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It’s important to anticipate these feelings so you can prepare yourself. How do you think you might handle those thoughts if they arise again in social situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that not everyone will always connect and that’s okay. I might also try to focus on enjoying the moment instead of worrying about fitting in.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Xiao Hua! Focusing on the moment can help reduce anxiety about fitting in. Do you feel these techniques can aid you in both social situations and your relationship with your mother?

User: Yes, I believe they can. I want to remember that relationships take time and patience, and it's okay to have ups and downs.

Consultant: That’s a really mature perspective, and it reflects the progress you've made. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to apply it. What do you consider your key takeaways?

User: I learned to trust my ability to engage socially, focus on positive support from others, and use affirmations to boost my confidence. I feel ready to face future challenges.

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights! You’ve made impressive strides, and I’m confident you can apply these strategies moving forward. How do you feel about the progress we've made in our sessions?

User: I feel really good about it! I appreciate your guidance and support in helping me believe in myself.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure to support you, Xiao Hua. Remember, you can always return if you need additional support or just want to talk. You’ve developed some great skills here today. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel much better equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you the best as you continue your journey. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes if you choose to come back!

User: Thank you! I’m excited about what’s ahead!
