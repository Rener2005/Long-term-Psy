Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqing! I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about your feelings towards your mother and the pressure you feel in your studies. How have you been since then?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty frustrated. My science grades have dropped, and it feels like my mom's been monitoring me even more closely. Sometimes, I feel like she just doesn’t understand me at all.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your mom’s supervision, especially since you’re struggling with your grades. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?

User: It makes me feel really suffocated. I want to do well, but I feel like no matter how much I try, it's never good enough for her. I also think she compares me to my sister too much because she was always there for our parents.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoqing. It seems like you’re feeling not only overwhelmed but also misunderstood in your efforts. In what ways do you think you could express your feelings to your mom so she can understand your perspective better?

User: I’m not sure. I’ve tried talking to her, but she just seems to focus on the grades and doesn't really listen to how I feel about everything. I wish she could acknowledge my efforts instead of just my results.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you want to feel heard and appreciated for your efforts rather than just your achievements. What do you think might help her see things from your perspective—do you have any ideas on how to approach these conversations differently?

User: Maybe I could explain to her how I feel when she compares me to my sister or tells me what to do all the time. I could try to say it calmly, but I worry she might get defensive.

Consultant: That's a good thought. Speaking calmly can indeed help prevent defensiveness. Let’s practice how you might start that conversation. Imagine sitting down with her—what would you say first?

User: I guess I would say something like, “Mom, I really want to talk about how I feel when you help me with my studies.” But I’m afraid she won’t take me seriously.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re already thinking about how to express your feelings directly. If she doesn’t seem to take you seriously, how could you reinforce your point or help her understand better?

User: Maybe I could share specific examples. Like when I was struggling with a topic, instead of just focusing on my grade, I needed more support. I wish she could see I’m really trying.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Using specific examples can help make your feelings more relatable and less personal, which might make her more receptive. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. I really want her to understand me.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel nervous. It shows that you care about this relationship. What might you do to prepare for this conversation and manage your anxiety?

User: I guess I could practice what I want to say in front of a mirror or write it down. That way, I won't forget my points when it’s time to talk.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is a fantastic strategy! It can help you gain confidence about expressing your feelings. After you talk to her, how would you like to follow up with her to see how she’s processing what you discussed?

User: Maybe I could ask her how she felt about our conversation a few days later. I want to keep the dialogue open, so I don't just dump my feelings and leave it.

Consultant: Keeping the dialogue open is a great way to show that you care about her feelings, too. If the conversation goes as you hope, how would that make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel relieved and a bit more confident if she sees my side. I really hope we can reach some understanding.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Fostering understanding between you two could help strengthen your relationship. What are some of the feelings you think might come up if she responds positively?

User: I’d probably feel validated and less alone in this struggle. It would be nice to feel like we’re on the same team.

Consultant: Being on the same team can create such a supportive environment! What about if the conversation doesn't go as planned? How can you take care of yourself?

User: I guess I could remind myself it’s okay if she doesn’t understand right away. I could talk to a friend about it or express my feelings in my sketchbook to let it out.

Consultant: Those are excellent coping strategies! Expressing your feelings and seeking support from friends can reinforce your emotional resilience. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your most actionable takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s about being more open with my mom about my feelings, using specific examples, and preparing ahead of time. I feel like that could help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! You're taking a huge step towards opening that line of communication. Remember, it is a process, and you’re doing wonderfully. Let’s check in next time about how your conversation went and how you're feeling. You’ve got this, Xiaoqing!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. I’ll definitely give it a try!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqing! I’m glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your mother’s recent adjustments in expectations?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel like not much has changed. I notice my mom focuses a lot on my schoolwork, and I struggle to believe she actually cares about my other interests, like my art.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a mix of frustration and doubt about your mother's understanding of you. I’d love to hear more about your feelings regarding this situation. What specific aspects of your relationship with her do you feel are challenging right now?

User: Well, sometimes I feel like she only values my grades. I wish she would appreciate my painting more. It just makes me feel less confident in myself, like I have to prove I'm good enough in school to gain her approval.

Consultant: That's a powerful feeling, Xiaoqing. It seems like you’re feeling pressured to meet certain expectations to gain your mother’s recognition. Can you tell me more about how this pressure affects your confidence and motivation in both school and your art?

User: It makes me anxious and I often doubt my abilities. I just want her to see that I do try hard in art, and I really enjoy it! But when academic pressure builds up, I freeze and can’t focus.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when balancing pressure from school with your passion for art. Let’s take a moment to explore your thoughts when you’re feeling anxious. What kinds of thoughts go through your mind when the pressure mounts?

User: I usually think that if I don't get good grades, my mom will be disappointed, and I might even feel like she loves my sister more because she’s doing better in school.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaoqing. It seems like that thought might be quite heavy for you—feeling like you’re in competition for your mother’s love. What evidence do you have that supports this belief, and do you think there might be other explanations for your mother’s focus on grades?

User: I don’t know…sometimes I think she might just be worried about my future. But I can’t help but feel overshadowed by my sister’s success. It makes me feel like I’ll never be enough for her.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern, and it’s okay to feel that way. It might help to consider how your mother’s intentions might come from a place of care rather than competition. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them to help them understand their situation better?

User: I think I’d tell them to talk to their parent honestly about their feelings and to share what they love about what they do. Maybe they would feel more understood.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Communicating about your feelings could open a door for more understanding. How do you feel about trying to express your passion for art to your mother? What could you say to help her see its value in your life?

User: I guess I could try to show her some of my artwork and explain how it makes me feel. It might help her understand that I'm putting effort into something I love.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Sharing your artwork could be a wonderful way to bridge that gap. Perhaps we can role-play that conversation together. How would you want it to start?

User: I might begin with: “Mom, I really want to share something I love with you...” and then show her my latest painting.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s personal and inviting. What do you hope she’ll gain from this conversation once she sees your art?

User: I hope she will recognize that I’m passionate about painting and that it’s important to me. Maybe it would help her understand me better.

Consultant: I believe that’s a meaningful goal, Xiaoqing. Helping her see your passion can build that understanding. After this conversation, how do you think you might feel about your art and your relationship with her?

User: I think it could help me feel more confident, especially if she can appreciate what I love. Maybe I won’t feel so pressured all the time.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Creating a supportive space can lead to more openness. As we work through this with your mother, let’s think about ways to maintain that confidence in your art. How can you keep nurturing that side of yourself, regardless of academic pressures?

User: I think I want to set aside time each week just for painting. It really helps me relax, and I feel more myself when I do it.

Consultant: Setting aside dedicated time for painting sounds like a fantastic idea! It’s essential to prioritize what brings you joy and helps you recharge. How do you think you can balance this with your schoolwork?

User: Maybe I can create a schedule that includes both study time and art time so I don't feel like I have to give up one for the other.

Consultant: That’s a balanced approach! A schedule can help ensure you invest time in what you love while still meeting your academic goals. It’s great to hear you’re taking charge of your time. What other strategies do you think could help foster a positive attitude towards both your studies and your art?

User: I could set small goals for my school projects and reward myself with painting time once I complete them. That might keep me motivated!

Consultant: That’s a clever way to motivate yourself! Rewarding your effort can create a positive cycle of achievement and enjoyment. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the steps we’ve discussed regarding communicating with your mother and balancing your passions?

User: I feel more hopeful! Talking about my feelings and sharing my art sounds like a good way to build understanding. I also feel excited to manage my time better.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaoqing! You’ve made significant strides today in understanding your feelings and planning positive actions. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. When you express yourself and nurture your art, you’re cultivating a part of your identity. I’m here to support you whenever you need it!

User: Thank you so much! This has helped me a lot. I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and remember to reach out anytime you need support. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaoqing! It's great to have you here today. I know you recently participated in a drawing competition and received excellent recognition. How are you feeling about that experience?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good about it. Winning was a big boost for my confidence, and for the first time, I feel like I really did something great.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like this recognition has made you feel proud of yourself and raised your sense of self-worth. How do you think this achievement might impact other areas of your life, like your studies or your relationship with your parents?

User: Well, I think it makes me more hopeful. I want to carry this confidence into my studies, especially in subjects I find challenging, like math. I also hope it helps me communicate better with my mom. Sometimes, I feel like she prefers my sister.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to share your achievements and feelings with your mom. What specific thoughts or feelings do you have when you think about talking to her about your drawing success?

User: I feel anxious. I worry she might not really care or might compare me to my sister again. It makes me hesitant to bring it up.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and hesitance are very common. What if we explored those thoughts a bit more? Can you share what goes through your mind when you think that your mom might not care about your achievements?

User: I guess I think she just wants me to do well in school like my sister does. Sometimes it feels like my successes don’t matter as much. 

Consultant: It sounds like you are feeling some pressure to meet expectations. What evidence do you have for that belief? Is there a possibility that your mom could appreciate your success in drawing even if it doesn’t relate directly to academics?

User: I suppose she might be happy for me, but she usually focuses on my grades, which makes me feel overlooked.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. What if you approached her differently? You could share your drawing success and express how it makes you feel, perhaps inviting her to see it as part of your growth rather than a comparison to your sister’s achievements.

User: That could work. If I say it confidently, maybe she’ll see what it means to me.

Consultant: Exactly! Confidence can make a huge difference in how others perceive our experiences. What goals might you set for yourself this week to practice sharing your successes, both in art and in other subjects?

User: I could tell my mom about the competition and my drawings. For my studies, maybe I could set a goal to study at least 30 minutes each day for math.

Consultant: Those sound like great, achievable goals! Sharing your achievements with your mom and dedicating time to studying can help strengthen those areas. How do you think you’ll feel after taking those steps?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself no matter how it goes. Just trying will be a big step for me!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Remember that the process itself is important. Have you thought about any strategies for how you might approach your mom during that conversation?

User: I think I’ll just keep it simple at first. Maybe share my excitement about winning, and then see where the conversation goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach. Starting with your excitement can help create a positive atmosphere for the conversation. Is there anything else you would like to explore related to your studies or your relationship with your mom?

User: Part of me is also worried about being disappointed if she doesn’t react the way I hope. 

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern. How might you prepare for that possibility? What could you remind yourself if the conversation doesn’t go as you envisioned?

User: I guess I need to remind myself that my worth isn’t solely based on my mom's reaction. My drawing achievement still matters, regardless of her response.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your achievements are valid and worthy regardless of others' reactions. As we wrap up our session today, what have you learned about transferring your confidence from art into other areas of your life?

User: I’ve learned that I can be proactive in sharing my achievements and that it’s important to believe in myself first. I feel motivated to take these steps.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Xiaoqing! It’s all about building on that confidence. Remember, these skills take practice. I believe in your ability to express yourself and strengthen those family relationships. I look forward to hearing about your conversations next time!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to see where this goes. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time to hear how everything went.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqing! It's great to see you again. I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling since our last session, especially after that family meeting where you expressed your thoughts. 

User: Hi! I feel really proud of myself for sharing my thoughts during the meeting. It felt good to be heard. My mom seemed to appreciate it too, which made me feel happy!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience strengthened your relationship with your mom. What specific feelings did you experience during and after you shared your thoughts?

User: I felt nervous at first, but then I felt a rush of relief after speaking. It was like a weight lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It sounds like expressing yourself brought you some relief, which is a great outcome. How do you think this experience influences your relationship with your mom?

User: I think it made her see me more as an equal, rather than just a child she needs to correct all the time. It feels like we are starting to understand each other better.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Feeling understood is important for building a strong connection. Are there any other situations where you’d like to apply this sense of open communication?

User: Yes, I want to be more open with my mom about my schoolwork too, especially since I sometimes struggle with my science subjects. 

Consultant: Being open about your struggles is a brave step. How might you approach that conversation with your mom?

User: I could tell her that I find science challenging and that I need her support instead of just criticism. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Expressing your needs is essential. How do you think she might respond to you sharing that?

User: I hope she would understand and help me find ways to improve instead of just telling me to try harder. 

Consultant: That’s a positive hope. If you find that she responds well, how might that change the way you feel about sharing things with her in the future?

User: It would make me feel more comfortable talking to her about anything, not just my schoolwork. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Building that comfort can open the door to deeper conversations. Are there any particular strategies you feel would help you communicate your feelings and needs effectively?

User: I think I could practice what I want to say beforehand, maybe even write it down if I’m really nervous. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Preparing what you want to say can boost your confidence. How do you feel about practicing some communication techniques together right now?

User: Sure! I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by picking a hypothetical situation, like asking for help with homework. How would you express that to your mom?

User: I’d say something like, “Mom, I’ve been struggling with my science homework and I really need your help to understand it better.” 

Consultant: That’s a clear and assertive approach! Highlighting your struggle and asking for help directly is very effective. How does that make you feel, saying it out loud?

User: It makes me feel a bit more relaxed, like it’s not so scary to ask for help. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember this feeling of relaxation—you can carry it with you into real conversations. Are there any additional topics you’d like to explore about your relationship with your mom?

User: I think I need to work on being more positive about my abilities. Sometimes I feel like I can’t do well in school and that makes me avoid talking about it.

Consultant: Recognizing that feeling is an important step. How can you remind yourself of your strengths when the negative thoughts start to creep in?

User: I could think about the compliments I’ve received recently, especially for my drawing and my progress in expressing myself. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Reflecting on your successes can help counter those negative thoughts. Would you like to practice some affirmations that reinforce your strengths?

User: Yes, I think that could help boost my confidence.

Consultant: Fantastic! How about starting with, “I am capable of learning and improving in my studies, just like I did by expressing my thoughts”? 

User: I like that! It feels encouraging. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Positive affirmations can be a powerful tool. How often do you think you can incorporate these affirmations into your routine?

User: Maybe every morning before school, it could help set a positive tone for the day. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting your day positively can influence how you feel throughout. As we wrap up, what do you think are the most significant takeaways from today’s session? 

User: I feel more equipped to communicate my needs and recognize my strengths better. It's comforting to know I can practice before talking to my mom.

Consultant: That’s so encouraging to hear! You’ve made great progress in building your communication skills. Remember, it’s all about practice and being kind to yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the help and feel more prepared now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoqing. I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Just remember, you’ve got the tools to manage these conversations. If you ever feel uncertain, you can always come back for support. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything today. 

Consultant: Until next time, take care and keep practicing those affirmations! Goodbye for now!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqing! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I’ve been participating more in class, which gives me a sense of achievement. But sometimes, I still struggle with time management when it comes to studying.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you've been feeling a sense of achievement and getting more involved in class! Time management can certainly be a challenge, especially with everything else going on. Can you tell me more about what specific areas of managing your study time feel difficult for you?

User: I often find myself distracted and end up procrastinating. I know I want to study, but it’s hard to get started, and then I get anxious about not finishing everything on time.

Consultant: It sounds like procrastination is creating a cycle of anxiety for you. Thank you for sharing that. Can you think of what thoughts cross your mind when you find it hard to start studying? How do those thoughts make you feel?

User: Sometimes I think, “I’ll never be able to finish this,” or “It’s too overwhelming.” Those thoughts make me feel even more anxious and then I just avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those kinds of thoughts would contribute to your anxiety. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won’t be able to finish your studies? 

User: Well, sometimes I really do get behind, but I also know that it’s just because I didn’t start early. I guess I can finish if I manage my time better.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! It seems like there’s potential for a different narrative here. If a friend of yours were feeling this way, how might you advise them to think about their situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that they can start small and just focus on completing one task at a time. It’s about progress, not perfection.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Starting with small, manageable steps can make a big difference. How do you feel about creating a study schedule that breaks your tasks into smaller parts?

User: That sounds good! I think if I have a plan, it’ll be easier to tackle tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! A plan can help provide structure and lessen those overwhelming feelings. What subjects or tasks do you want to prioritize in your study schedule?

User: I should probably focus on math and science since those are the subjects I find tricky. But I also want to make time for drawing, as that helps me relax.

Consultant: Balancing your studies with activities you enjoy, like drawing, is a great strategy for maintaining motivation. How about we create a structure that includes both study sessions and breaks for drawing? 

User: I would like that! Maybe I could study for an hour and then take a break to draw for about 30 minutes?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It keeps your mind fresh and gives you something to look forward to. Would you like to come up with a specific time to study each day?

User: Yes! I think I could set aside Monday to Friday after school for math and science, and then maybe draw on the weekends.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Setting aside consistent time each day can help build a routine. How does this plan make you feel in terms of your study anxiety?

User: I actually feel a bit relieved. Having a schedule makes it feel more manageable and less stressful.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you feel relieved! Establishing a schedule can make a big difference. Now, let’s also think about how to handle any potential obstacles that come your way. If you feel overwhelmed, what strategies could you use to refocus?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I don’t have to get everything done at once and that I can take breaks if needed.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy—reminding yourself of the importance of breaks can help prevent overwhelm. Would you like to role-play how you might talk to yourself in those moments?

User: Sure! I could say something like, “It’s okay to take a break. You’ll come back feeling better.”

Consultant: That’s a supportive and kind message to yourself! Practicing self-compassion is crucial. Moving forward, how do you feel about your family communication? Have you found ways to connect with your mom since our last session?

User: Yes! I talked to her about my study plans, and she was really supportive. It felt nice to share my thoughts and not feel judged.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! It shows you’re building a positive dialogue with your mother. How can you continue to maintain this open channel of communication?

User: I think I’ll keep her updated about my schedule and involve her in my drawing time so she can see what I’m working on.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Involving her can strengthen your connection. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what strategies you've implemented today to manage your time and maintain positive family interactions.

User: I’ve created a study schedule for math and science while allowing time for drawing. I’ve also learned to be kinder to myself when I feel overwhelmed and plan to keep my mom involved in my activities.

Consultant: You’ve made incredible strides today, Xiaoqing! Remember, it’s all about progress. If you maintain these strategies, I believe you will see continued improvement in managing your time and enhancing your family relationships. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident about balancing my study and personal interests.

Consultant: You are very welcome! I am proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further support. I look forward to hearing about your continued successes next time we meet!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqing! I'm really happy to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I've been following the study plan we created, and I think it's helping both my studies and my relationship with my mom.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! It seems like you've made some significant progress in both areas. Can you tell me more about how the study plan is going and how it has affected your relationship with your mom?

User: Sure! I've been able to stick to my routine better, and I feel more organized. My mom has also been more supportive lately. We even discussed my goals together, which felt nice.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a positive shift in your dynamics with your mom. It's great that you're feeling more organized too. How does this support from your mom make you feel?

User: It makes me feel appreciated and seen. I used to think she preferred my sister, but now I realize that she really cares. Our conversations have become more open.

Consultant: That's really heartwarming to hear. It seems like there’s a genuine connection developing. As we reflect on your progress today, what achievements or changes are you most proud of?

User: I'm proud that I can express my thoughts more clearly and that I'm actually working on my studies without feeling so overwhelmed. I used to avoid it a lot.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement, Xiaoqing! It's not easy to confront things that cause anxiety, so recognizing this change is important. What do you think helped you make this progress in facing your studies?

User: I think having a clear plan really helped, and also talking things over with my mom. We’ve been more of a team now, instead of butting heads.

Consultant: Working together as a team can really transform a relationship. It seems like both your efforts and your mom's support have contributed to this positive change. Looking ahead, what are some ways you would like to build on this foundation that you've created?

User: I’d like to keep up my study routine and maybe also try to involve my mom in some of my projects. It could be fun to work together more often.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Involving your mom in your projects might not only strengthen your bond but also provide her with insight into your interests and abilities. Are there specific projects or activities you want to share with her?

User: I’m thinking about my art projects. I want to show her how much I enjoy painting, and maybe she could help me with ideas for improving my work.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Sharing your passion for art can definitely foster a deeper connection. It also gives you both a chance to bond over something that truly interests you. What do you hope to achieve through this collaboration?

User: I hope to get her feedback and maybe even her encouragement. It would mean a lot to me to know she’s invested in what I love.

Consultant: That’s such a positive motivation! Seeking feedback and encouragement can really boost your confidence. How do you plan to ask her to get involved in your projects?

User: I think I’ll just bring it up casually during one of our chats. I could show her some of my work and ask what she thinks.

Consultant: That sounds like a natural approach! Being open and casual is often the best way to share your thoughts. How do you feel about initiating this conversation with her?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I’m also excited. I hope she’ll be as enthusiastic as I am.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when it comes to opening up about your passions. Remember, it’s an opportunity for both of you to connect. If she responds positively, how do you think that could impact your relationship?

User: I think it would bring us even closer. It would show her that I'm serious about my interests and that I want her to share in that with me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a wonderful way to deepen your connection. Now that we've explored your progress and future plans, let’s take a moment to summarize what’s been achieved. What do you think are the most significant developments since we started these sessions?

User: Definitely learning how to communicate better with my mom and becoming more organized with my studies. It feels great to have made these changes.

Consultant: That’s certainly impressive! You've really taken ownership of your personal growth. As we look toward the future, what strategies do you feel can help you maintain this positive momentum?

User: I think regular check-ins with my mom and keeping up my study plan will help. I also want to continue exploring my artistic side, as it brings me joy.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Regular conversations and maintaining your routines are key components to sustaining your progress. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or concerns you'd like to discuss?

User: Not really, I just feel hopeful about moving forward. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic feeling to have! It's been a pleasure to witness your growth throughout this journey, Xiaoqing. Remember, you have the tools and support to continue on this path. If you ever need to come back for guidance, I'll be here for you. How are you feeling about concluding our sessions today? 

User: I feel good! I'm ready to embrace these changes and keep moving forward. Thank you so much for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so proud of all you’ve accomplished. Enjoy your journey ahead, and take care of yourself!
