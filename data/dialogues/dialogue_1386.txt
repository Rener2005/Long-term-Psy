Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm happy to see you today. Before we dive into our discussion, can you share how you've been feeling lately regarding your emotional situation?

User: Hi. I've been really confused and anxious about my feelings. I have two boyfriends right now, and I can't decide which one to choose. One is an old classmate who lives far away, and the other is a colleague at my job. It's making me lose sleep.

Consultant: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure trying to navigate your feelings for both of them. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes this choice so difficult for you?

User: I think it's because they both offer different things. The long-distance guy has a lot of history with me, but I'm not sure if we could have a future. The colleague is more present, but I'm worried about mixing work and romance.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough dilemma. You're weighing the comfort of familiarity against the practicality of being with someone nearby. What do you think it is about each relationship that makes you uneasy when you think about making a decision?

User: With my classmate, I worry that distance will always be a barrier. I’m afraid we'll drift apart or that it won’t be sustainable long-term. And with my colleague, I'm worried about how our coworkers would perceive our relationship. What if it creates tension at work?

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, Li. Let’s explore your thoughts around these worries. When you think about possibly drifting apart with your classmate, what specific thoughts come up? How do those thoughts make you feel?

User: I keep thinking that if he really cared, he would move to be closer. It makes me feel anxious, like I'm not a priority. I also fear that choosing him would mean sacrificing something with my colleague, who could be more reliable.

Consultant: It seems like you're considering your worth in these relationships based on their actions and availability. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? Is there evidence to support the idea that distance means he's not committed to you?

User: I guess I don't really know what he feels. He does reach out and tries to stay connected. I just can't shake the fear that it won’t work out.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when the future is uncertain. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them about balancing these feelings and concerns?

User: I would probably tell them to evaluate how they feel rather than just focusing on the logistics or what others think. But for some reason, I can't seem to apply that to myself.

Consultant: It's common to have difficulty following our own advice. Let’s try to identify what's truly important to you in a relationship, beyond logistics. What values do you have that you want to see reflected in your partner?

User: I value honesty and someone who’s supportive. I also want emotional connection and communication. I think that’s why I feel torn between them.

Consultant: Those are essential values to consider. Let’s keep those in mind as we move forward. How do you nurture those qualities in each relationship? Which relationship aligns more with what you truly need?

User: I feel like I communicate better with my colleague, but I share more of my personal history with my classmate. It's really confusing trying to balance these feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like both relationships fulfill different needs for you. What do you think would help you gain clarity on what you might prioritize in a partner moving forward?

User: Maybe I need to reflect on how I feel after spending time with each of them. Like what feelings do they evoke in me, and which interactions leave me feeling more fulfilled?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Keeping a journal or notes on your interactions could provide insights over time. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I can definitely try that. I want to be honest with myself about what I truly want in a relationship.

Consultant: Excellent! Awareness is a first step to clarity. As you reflect, remember it's also okay to take your time with this decision. What feelings emerge when you think about taking your time to navigate this choice?

User: I feel a bit relieved. Taking my time seems less overwhelming than rushing into a decision. But I still worry about disappointing either of them.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way. Remember that being honest with yourself can lead to honesty with them. You might consider discussing your feelings and concerns with them, which could alleviate some pressure. How do you feel about that?

User: I like that idea. It feels like it could lead to more open communication. I just hope they understand.

Consultant: Open communication is a vital part of any relationship. Who knows? They may also be feeling some uncertainties. By sharing your thoughts, you create a space for both of you to explore your feelings together. 

User: You're right; that could help both of us. I guess I just need to find the right moment to talk about it.

Consultant: Absolutely. Take your time to find that moment. It could be helpful to think of it as a conversation rather than a confrontation. What do you think would be the ideal setting for that talk?

User: Maybe during a relaxed weekend when we aren't rushed. I could just bring it up casually and see how they respond.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. A relaxed environment can help both of you feel comfortable discussing feelings. How can we ensure that you'll feel ready and confident in that conversation?

User: Honestly, I think practicing what I want to say in my head will help. Also, reminding myself that my feelings are valid.

Consultant: That's a great strategy, Li. Validating your feelings is important in this process. As we wrap up today, what have you concluded about your feelings and the way forward?

User: I realize I need to focus on my feelings and values, and that it's okay to take my time. I feel a little lighter just discussing everything.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li. You've made some significant progress today, and it's vital to honor your feelings as you navigate this situation. Remember, you're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you as you explore your emotions further. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I feel more equipped to handle this now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Reflect on what we discussed and let any insights come naturally. I look forward to our next session where we can continue this exploration together. Take care, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. It sounds like there have been some challenging feelings regarding your relationship. Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, after that argument with my colleague’s boyfriend, I've been feeling a lot of pressure. It's like I've reignited all my worries about the future of our relationship, and I just feel so uncertain.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when there’s been a conflict. Can you share what specific worries you've been having about your relationship and the decisions you might need to make?

User: Well, I’m worried that I might be rushing into things, like marriage. Sometimes, I feel like there's so much pressure on me from everyone around... it’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure from outside is adding to your internal doubts about the relationship. What do you think would help you feel more secure in your decision-making process regarding your relationship?

User: I'd like to better understand what I truly want. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just going along with it because it seems expected.

Consultant: That’s a very important insight. Understanding your own needs and desires is crucial. Can you think of a time recently when you felt your needs weren't being met in this relationship? What were those feelings like?

User: Yes, there are moments when I feel that my opinions or feelings don't matter as much. Like during the argument, I didn't feel heard at all, which just made me question everything more.

Consultant: It sounds like feeling unheard really intensified your concerns. How do you think acknowledging those feelings could change how you approach the relationship?

User: I think it might help me communicate better. But I’m also scared that it could lead to more conflict. What if it makes things worse instead of better?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Conflict can be daunting, but it can also lead to growth. What if we explored some ways you could express your feelings while minimizing the risk of escalating conflict?

User: That could be helpful. I just want to make sure I'm not overreacting or being overly dramatic about things.

Consultant: It’s common to worry about that. Expressing your feelings doesn’t mean you’re overreacting; it’s about standing up for your needs. Would you be willing to try sharing your feelings with your partner? What might that look like?

User: I could try to bring it up casually, maybe during a less intense moment instead of when we are already disagreeing. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Choosing a calm moment allows for a more constructive conversation. What do you think you would say to start that discussion?

User: I could say something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about our future and would like us to talk about what we both want.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. It opens the door for dialogue without placing blame. How would you feel if the conversation doesn’t go as you hope?

User: I guess I’d feel disappointed, but at least I would have tried. It's just hard to think about having to manage my expectations too.

Consultant: Managing expectations is indeed essential. It may help you to remind yourself that it’s okay for conversations to take time and to not have all the answers immediately. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels less pressure to have it all figured out right away. I think I need to remind myself of that more often.

Consultant: Absolutely. It’s a process. How about we reflect on some key points from our conversation today that will help you prepare for that discussion?

User: Sure. I think acknowledging my feelings and trying to communicate them in a calm manner are key points.

Consultant: Excellent! And also, being patient with yourself and managing your expectations are very important aspects as well. How are you feeling about your situation now compared to when we started?

User: Honestly, I'm still a bit anxious, but I feel like I have a clearer approach to tackle my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a positive development! Recognizing your approach is a significant step forward. Do you think you could share these insights with a trusted friend or family member as additional support before having the conversation?

User: I can try that. It might help to get some feedback and calm my nerves a little more.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Connecting with others can provide different perspectives and lend support. What do you think your next steps will be?

User: I think I’ll talk to a friend, prepare for that conversation, and give myself some grace if it doesn't go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a balanced approach. It’s about progress, not perfection. Remember, I’m here to support you as you navigate through this. How would you like to wrap up today’s session?

User: I think just reflecting on what we talked about has really helped. I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing self-reflection and open communication. You have the tools you need to move forward. I look forward to our next session to hear about your progress. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been dealing with some emotional confusion regarding your relationships. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're feeling?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really confused lately since my boyfriend from long distance came to visit. It made me compare my past relationship with my current one, and I just feel more anxious and lost.

Consultant: I understand that revisiting old feelings can stir up a lot of confusion and anxiety. What specific thoughts are coming to mind when you think about these two relationships?

User: I keep thinking about how different they are and whether I made the right choice with my current boyfriend. I feel guilty about my past relationship too—did I let it go too soon? 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re struggling with some guilt and uncertainty about your past and present choices. What emotions come up when you make these comparisons? 

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes even sad. I tend to stay awake at night, just thinking about it all, which makes it hard to focus on work.

Consultant: That must be really tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you're caught in such a crossroads. Let’s explore what aspects of both relationships you find yourself comparing most. What stands out to you?

User: Well, I think my past relationship felt more secure and loving, while my current one has its ups and downs. I worry that I might be missing something important in my life.

Consultant: It seems like security is very important to you in a relationship. Can you identify what exactly made you feel secure in your past relationship? 

User: My ex was very supportive and we shared a lot of our lives together. With my current boyfriend, I feel like he’s more focused on his life and has less time for me. That makes me doubt things.

Consultant: It's natural to crave that support and connection. Have you expressed these feelings to your current boyfriend? 

User: Not really. I don’t want to sound needy or push him away. I’m worried he might not understand. 

Consultant: I can see how that’s concerning. Communicating your needs can be difficult, but it could also help both of you understand each other better. What do you think might happen if you shared your feelings with him?

User: I guess I fear that he might get defensive or think I’m being unreasonable. I don’t want to jeopardize our relationship, but I feel stuck.

Consultant: That fear is completely valid. It's a common worry in relationships. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ways to approach this conversation that might help you feel more comfortable. What do you think would be a gentle way to open the dialogue?

User: I suppose I could start by sharing how I feel, rather than making it sound like an accusation. Maybe something like, "I've been feeling a bit neglected" could work?

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach! Starting with your feelings instead of placing blame can definitely create a more open space for discussion. How does that idea sit with you?

User: I feel a bit relieved thinking about presenting it that way. I just hope he understands.

Consultant: It's great to hear you feel relieved. Remember, you're expressing your needs and emotions, and that's a part of healthy communication. What would it mean for you if he did understand and responded positively?

User: That would be comforting. It might help me feel more secure in our relationship and less anxious. 

Consultant: Exactly! Addressing your feelings could lead to more understanding and connection, reducing your anxiety. As we continue, let’s also think about the impact of these feelings on your everyday life. How has this emotional turmoil affected your work?

User: I've been pretty distracted. I find it hard to concentrate on tasks, and sometimes I feel like I’m not performing well. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Stress from personal life can significantly impact work performance. Would it be helpful to establish a few strategies to manage that stress at work?

User: Yes, I think that might really help. I don't want my personal issues to affect my job.

Consultant: That's a proactive mindset. One strategy could be setting specific, short breaks during your workday to check in with how you're feeling. Making time to breathe and reflect might help you regain focus. What do you think?

User: That sounds doable. I can definitely try taking short breaks to clear my mind.

Consultant: Great! Another idea could be jotting down your thoughts or worries during those breaks. This can create a sense of clarity and help you address your feelings when you're not at work. Would that be something you’d consider?

User: Yes, I think writing things down could help me process my feelings better. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that. Writing can be a powerful tool for reflection. Now, let's recap what we've discussed. You plan to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend and use strategies at work to manage your stress. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel like I have a clearer path forward now, which is nice.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re feeling that way! One last thing—remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. It's normal to feel uncertain when navigating relationships. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re welcome! As we conclude today’s session, keep in mind the strategies we've discussed. If you need anything or want to share how things are going, I'm here for you. Take care!

User: Thank you so much! I will try my best.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li. I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. My emotional state has affected my work performance, and I've sensed that my colleagues have noticed it too. I feel disappointed and guilty about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure regarding your performance and your emotions. Can you share a bit more about what specifically has been bothering you at work lately?

User: Well, I keep putting things off and I feel like I'm not living up to my potential. I worry about what my colleagues think of me, and I’m struggling to keep up with my responsibilities.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel this way, especially when you're under pressure. What do you think is at the heart of your feelings of disappointment and guilt?

User: I think it's largely about my parents' expectations for me. They always talk about getting married and settling down, and I feel like I'm falling short in their eyes. This boils over into my professional life, making everything seem harder.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Balancing personal expectations with professional responsibilities can create a lot of inner conflict. What would it look like for you to feel more in control both of your emotions and your work responsibilities?

User: Ideally, I want to find a way to manage my feelings better so that I can focus on my work without all this anxiety. I want to communicate better with my parents without creating tension.

Consultant: Those are valuable goals. Let’s explore how we can break this down. First, can you identify any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you feel overwhelmed at work?

User: I often think, "I should be doing better," or "I can’t let my colleagues down." These thoughts make me feel more anxious, which leads to more procrastination.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite demanding and put a lot of pressure on you. What emotions do you experience when you have those thoughts?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit helpless. It's like I’m stuck in this loop of thinking that I'm not good enough.

Consultant: Recognizing that loop is an essential step. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. Is there evidence that supports the idea that you're not doing well? Can you think of any accomplishments or positive feedback you've received?

User: When I think about it, I have received positive feedback from my manager, and I have completed important projects. But in the moment, I still feel like I’m not doing enough.

Consultant: It’s great that you have those achievements to reflect on. Sometimes, our feelings can overshadow those accomplishments. What if you tried to remind yourself of these successes when those negative thoughts arise? 

User: That might help, but I’m not sure if it will change how I feel in the moment.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It might take some practice, but we can work on creating a list of positive affirmations or reminders you can refer to during those moments of doubt. Would you be willing to try that?

User: Yes, I think having something tangible might help me refocus.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s also talk about how your family expectations are affecting you. Have you had any recent conversations with your parents about their thoughts on marriage and your career?

User: I haven’t spoken to them directly about it. I’m scared it will lead to an argument. They can be quite pushy about these topics.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be apprehensive. How about we think of some strategies that would allow you to express your feelings and boundaries while still remaining respectful? 

User: I guess I could try to explain my feelings calmly without triggering them. But what if they don’t understand?

Consultant: That's a possibility, but keeping the conversation open and honest is key. You could also choose a time when they seem more relaxed to bring it up. How do you feel about planning for that?

User: It seems daunting, but it might be worth a shot. I want them to understand my perspective.

Consultant: It is daunting, but remember, it’s a step towards demonstrating your autonomy. It might help to rehearse what you want to say. Would you be comfortable drafting a few points ahead of the conversation?

User: Yes, I can do that. Rehearsing might ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! And remember, it’s about sharing your feelings, not about convincing them immediately. Let’s also keep working on managing the pressures you face. How do you feel about our progress so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Talking it out helps clear my mind and see things differently.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Each step you take is progress, and recognizing that is crucial. Before we wrap up, what are some key takeaways you want to focus on until our next session?

User: I want to practice affirmations and plan a conversation with my parents. I hope to approach them calmly.

Consultant: Those sound like solid intentions. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. We'll work through this together. 

User: Thank you so much. I appreciate your support and guidance! 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! You’re doing a great job in navigating these challenges. If you need anything before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today! How are you feeling after our last session? 

User: Hi, I've been feeling quite conflicted. My parents keep bringing up marriage during family gatherings, and I find it really stressful. It's like there's this expectation hanging over me.

Consultant: I hear you; the pressure from your parents about marriage can be overwhelming. Can you tell me what specific feelings come up for you during these conversations?

User: I feel angry and frustrated. I know they mean well, but it just makes me feel like I'm not living up to their expectations, and it's hard to express that to them.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's a tough position to be in, wanting to meet their expectations while also feeling pressured. What would you like to achieve when you talk to them about this topic?

User: I just want to communicate my feelings without causing a big argument. I want them to understand my perspective.

Consultant: That’s a great goal; it’s important to share your feelings openly. How do you think your parents would react if you expressed your need for space regarding this decision?

User: I honestly think they might get upset. They have their own expectations, and I don’t want to disappoint them.

Consultant: It's normal to worry about disappointing loved ones. Let's explore how you can frame your feelings in a way that expresses your needs while remaining respectful. What do you think is a good starting point for that conversation?

User: Maybe I could start by acknowledging their concerns, then share how I feel about marriage and my current focus on my career.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Acknowledging their concerns first can help lower defenses. How do you think you would feel while having this conversation?

User: I think I might feel scared and anxious about their reaction, but also a bit relieved to finally say something.

Consultant: It’s good to recognize those feelings. It’s entirely natural to feel afraid when discussing difficult topics. How might you manage your anxiety in the moment when you’re confronted by those feelings?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that it's okay to have my own timeline.

Consultant: Yes, deep breathing can help calm your nerves. It could also be beneficial to remind yourself of your values and what’s important to you in that moment. How do your values align with this conversation about marriage?

User: My values are really about being independent and making choices that feel right for me. I don't want to rush into anything just to satisfy them.

Consultant: That’s very insightful. Clarity on your values can empower your conversation. If you were to consider their perspective as well, how might you address their concerns without compromising your own beliefs?

User: I could tell them that while I understand their worries about my future, I’m focused on personal growth right now and that I hope they can support me in that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to frame it. By emphasizing personal growth, you’re expressing commitment to yourself, while inviting their support. How do you feel about practicing that communication?

User: I would definitely feel more prepared. I think practicing could help me find the right words.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s practice together! Imagine you’re starting that conversation with them. What would you say first?

User: I might say, "Mom, Dad, I really appreciate your concern about my future, but I want to share where I’m coming from.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful opening! It shows appreciation while setting the stage for your perspective. What might you want to follow up with after that?

User: I’d probably explain how much I enjoy focusing on my career and personal development at this time before discussing marriage further.

Consultant: Excellent! Being clear about your priorities can help them see your viewpoint. After this conversation, how would you like to feel in terms of your relationship with your parents?

User: I want to feel like I’ve been honest with them and that we've established some better understanding, even if they don’t completely agree.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Building understanding is key. When you think about the outcome, how confident do you feel about this strategy?

User: I feel a bit more confident now, but I still have some worries about how they’ll react.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have those worries. Just remember, the goal is to open a dialogue that respects both your feelings and theirs.  How can we reinforce this confidence moving forward?

User: Perhaps I can remind myself that I have the right to speak my truth and that their acceptance will take time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective! Affirming your right to your feelings is essential. As we conclude today, what’s one key takeaway you’ll remember from our session?

User: I think my main takeaway is the importance of balancing my truth with understanding my parents' feelings regarding marriage, and practicing how to express that.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Practicing and preparing for these conversations will empower you. Remember, it’s about the journey of communication. I believe you can build that bridge with your parents.

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle this now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear you feel more ready. Remember, take it one step at a time. If you need further support, I'm here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my relationship decisions. I've had a good talk with my boyfriend, and we managed to evaluate our future together more objectively. But I still have some lingering fears regarding my choices.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that your conversation went well. It's normal to have fears about important decisions. Can you share more about what specifically causes you to feel uncertain about your choices?

User: I think it's mostly about commitment. Sometimes I worry if I'm making the right decision and whether I can handle the responsibilities that come with a deeper commitment.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when considering a significant step in a relationship. What do you think would help you feel more confident in your choice?

User: Maybe reflecting more on what I really want and the values that are important to me could help. I also want to feel secure in the relationship.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach. Understanding your values can clarify what you truly seek in a partnership. What are some of those core values for you?

User: Honesty, support, and shared goals are very important to me. I need to feel that we're on the same page regarding our futures.

Consultant: Those are essential values indeed. Given what you've shared, how do you feel your boyfriend aligns with these values?

User: He is generally supportive and honest, but I sometimes question whether our long-term goals are truly aligned. 

Consultant: It’s good to reflect on alignment in values and goals. What specific goals do you feel unsure about in your relationship?

User: I'm not sure if he sees marriage as something important in the near future, while I do. I worry that this might create issues later on.

Consultant: It’s very important to address these differences early on. How do you think you could approach this topic with him to gain more clarity?

User: I could bring it up in a direct yet gentle way, maybe by asking about his thoughts on future commitments during one of our conversations. 

Consultant: That's a constructive idea! Open communication can really strengthen your relationship. What feelings come up for you at the thought of having that conversation?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and hope. I'm anxious about how he might react, but I hope it leads to more clarity for both of us.

Consultant: That's a natural mix of emotions. It shows your desire for clarity while also recognizing the risks of vulnerability. What would be a small step to prepare yourself for this conversation?

User: Perhaps I could write down what I want to say or practice with a friend before talking to him. This way, I’ll feel more ready.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Preparing yourself can boost your confidence. How does having a plan like this make you feel about the upcoming conversation?

User: It makes me feel more in control and less anxious. Plus, I think I’ll express myself better when I have clarity in my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a positive insight! Focusing on your thoughts can greatly help in expressing yourself clearly. Reflecting on our previous discussions, what has been your biggest takeaway in terms of handling your fears about commitments?

User: I’ve realized that communication is key, and I shouldn’t shy away from discussing important issues. Ignoring them won't help.

Consultant: That's a profound realization, Li! Recognizing that communication is essential can really empower you. Looking ahead, how can you apply this understanding in other situations, not just in your relationship?

User: I think I can use this approach in my work as well. If there are any misunderstandings, I’ll make it a point to discuss them openly instead of avoiding them. 

Consultant: Absolutely! This approach can foster better relationships in all areas of life. As we near the end of our time today, how do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel much more equipped to handle my feelings and fears now. Understanding my values and being open to communication has boosted my confidence.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made significant progress, and I believe you're well on your way to maintaining a strong sense of self-confidence in your relationship. What will be your next step after today's session?

User: My next step will be preparing for the conversation with my boyfriend. I’ll take some time to reflect on my thoughts and practice expressing them.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but taking action is what matters. I'm here to support you whenever you need guidance. You've done incredibly well today, Li.

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel a lot better about things now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have more to discuss in the future. Take care, Li!

User: Thanks! I really appreciate it. Goodbye!
